## February 2023 update

PropertyWebBuilder is now a standalone Ruby on Rails app (it is no longer a Ruby on Rails engine). It has also been upgraded to use Rails 6 and Ruby 3!

I am currently working on a Rails 7 upgrade which will use the wonderful vite-ruby gem to re-implement the admin panel with vue.js and the quasar framework:

https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/tree/vite

Also, I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting and would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

[https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)


## Motivation

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.


## Demo

<!-- You can try out a demo at [https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com](https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com/)

To see the admin panel, login as user admin@example.com with a password of ""pwb123456"". -->

There was previously a demo hosted on heroku but since they ended the free plan I have had to take it down.

![pwb_iphone_landing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1741198/22990222/bfec0168-f3b8-11e6-89df-b950c4979970.png)


## Create your own real estate website with no technical knowledge

The simplest way to create a website with PropertyWebBuilder is to use Heroku, a trusted service provider.  They no longer have the free tier which was a great selling point but are still worth trying out.

Just [sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity), click the button below and in a few minutes your site will be ready

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder)

Here is a video about how to deploy to heroku:

[![Depoly PWB to heroku](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hyapXTwGyr4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyapXTwGyr4 ""Deploy PWB to heroku"")


## Install locally

PWB was previously designed to be included as an engine in an existing Ruby on Rails app. This is no longer the case and you can now run it directly as a standalone app.

It can also be installed locally as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder.git
cd property_web_builder
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails pwb:db:seed
```

## Rails Version

PropertyWebBuilder runs with Rails '~> 6.0'

## Ruby Version

PropertyWebBuilder runs with Ruby >= 3.0.0.

## Getting started

Get started with the application by following the installation steps.

> Prerequisite
>
> - [Docker and docker-compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the GitHub repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate.git
```

### 2. Build an Start the application

To effectively build and run the application, make use of the `mre` executable on Linux. If you are using Windows, utilize `mre.exe`, whereas on Mac, opt for `mre-macos`.

```shell
$ cd microrealestate
$ ./mre build
```

When building the first time, you can expect a series of questions to configure the application. Answer the questions as prompted to tailor the application to your specific needs. Once you've completed this interactive configuration, a `.env` file will be generated, containing your settings.

```
? Have you created a mailgun account for sending emails (https://www.mailgun.com/)? No

? Enter the URL to access the landlord front-end: http://localhost:8080/landlord

? Enter the URL to access the tenant front-end (it should share the same domain and port as the landlord front-end URL): http://localhost:8080/tenant
```

Once the build process has been completed, execute the following command to launch the application:

```shell
$ ./mre start
```

Once the application has started successfully, you will find a link displayed in the console to access the application.

Simply copy the link and paste into your preferred web browser to access the application's interface.

This repository is deprecated in favor of [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate).

The new version uses latest stack on the front-end (NextJS, ReactJS, MobX). The split between front and back-end code is more obvious and the UI has been fully rewritten.

Also, additional functionalities were added in order to customize the application to the landlords needs.

Developer wise [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate) should be easier to enhance and to maintain.

## Loca

### What is Loca?

This nodejs project is a tentative of web application that offers a toolkit for owners of buildings, flats, offices, meeting rooms, car parks, letter boxes...

The idea is to make easy the management of properties and occupants by proposing many services:

- Gather all information of your properties and occupants in one place
- Create rent contract from templates available in the system
- Follow the rent payments month by month
- Template letters for recovery of not paid rents

![Loca](http://www.nuageprive.fr/images/loca-sample.png 'Open source real estate management')

### Getting started

Follow instructions from [here](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate#getting-started)

### Technical Stack

Back-end:

Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS (templates), PassportJS (authentication)

Front-End:

JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, and [frontexpress](https://github.com/camelaissani/frontexpress)

Build system based on RollupJS

### Why do I created this application?

Simply to help my best friend and I to manage properties that we rent.

Above all, to have a good reason to play with node and javascript :-)

A library that enables programmatic interaction with [Daft.ie](https://daft.ie). Daft.ie has nationwide coverage and contains about 80% of the total available properties in Ireland.


## Installation

Daftlistings is available on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/daftlistings/). You can install daftlistings using pip.

``` bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install daftlistings
```

To install the development version, run:

``` bash
pip install https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/daftlistings/archive/dev.zip
```

## Usage

``` python
from daftlistings import Daft

daft = Daft()
listings = daft.search()

for listing in listings:
    print(listing.title)
    print(listing.price)
    print(listing.daft_link)
    # ...
```

By default, the Daft search function iterates over each page of results and appends each Listing object to the array that is returned. If you wish to limit the number of results that are returned you can use the `max_pages` argument.

```python
daft.search(max_pages=1)
```

## Approach:

- load Pandas DataFrame containing (Dec-17) housing data retrieved by means of the [following scraper](https://github.com/Weesper1985/Funda-Scraper), supplemented with longitude and latitude coordinates mapped to zip code (via [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/#)
- do some simple data exploration / visualisation
- remove non-numeric data, NaNs, and outliers (everything above 3 x standard dev of y)
- define explanatory variables (surface,latitude,and longitude) and independent variable (price EUR)
- split the data in train and test sets (+ normalise independent variables where required) 
- find the optimal model parameters using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)'s GridSearchCV
- fit the model using GridSearchCV's optimal parameters
- evaluate estimator performance by means of 5 fold 'shuffled' nested cross-validation
- predict cross validated estimates of y for each data point and plot on scatter diagram vs true y

## Packages required

- [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

# Online Rental Property Manager (ORPM)

<img src=""https://cdn.bigprof.com/screencasts/online-rental-property-manager-demo-6.3.gif"" title=""ORPM screencast"" alt=""ORPM (Online rental property manager) screencast"" width=""960"" height=""465"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 960px; height: auto;"">

Online rental property manager (ORPM) is a free open source app.
It allows you to manage landlords, rental properties, units, 
applications, leases and tenants. Add all details related to the tenants, i.e. references, 
rental history, employment history and income overview.

ORPM was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/).
So you can easily customize it to add/remove 
details or any extra functionality to fit your own requirements. 
ORPM is a responsive, multi-user web-based application that you can access from your PC, tablet, 
mobile or any other device.

license of choice. 2. You don't need to install AppGini in order to use this app.*

---

## Installation

This is a PHP/MySQL web application that you run from a browser. You can install it either locally
on your own PC, or to a web/intranet server.

### 1. Try the live demo

* We provide a live demo with sample data [here](https://demos.appgini.com/online-rental-property-manager/)
* You can access the demo as a guest user, with read-only access to data.
* You can also access the demo using the following credentials:
  * Username: `demo`
  * Password: `demo`

  The above credentials allow browsing the sample data with read-only access,
  as well as adding new data, with full access (view, edit, delete). Data added
  through the demo account is automatically removed periodically to prevent
  cluttering the demo app.

### 2. Trying it out using Gitpod (requires a github account)

This application is ready to run within the Gitpod IDE.
This will allow you to try the application out and develop it for your needs.
All you will need is a web browser. _Do not use this in production!!!_

**[Launch private demo on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-rental-property-manager)**

The app would take a couple of minutes to launch.
Afterwards, you'll see the welcome screen of the app in the right part of the window, where you can start the setup wizard.
When prompted to enter the database name, database username and datatbase password, you should enter `appgini` for all.

Gitpod is intended for previewing the app only, and is _not suitable for use in actual production environments_.

---

(ask your server admin if you need help on that).

3. In your web browser, visit `http://server.com/app-folder/`
(change `server.com` above to the actual domain name or IP address of your server,
and change `app-folder` to the name of the folder inside your document root where
you uploaded the files in step 2).

4. You should now see the setup wizard in your browser. Just follow the steps!

## Customization

This application was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini). This means you can easily customize it by
opening the included AXP project file in AppGini. Examples of possible customization you can do from there include:

* [Changing the application theme](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/how-to-easily-change-your-appgini-application-theme).
* Adding more fields to existing tables, or entirely new tables to fit your use cases.
* Changing the options/behavior of any table/field in your application.
* For more details, check [the AppGini tutorials](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/).

You can also perform more advanced customization, like adding reports,
changing validation rules, adding business logic, ... etc. through hooks.
Please refer to the [AppGini hooks documentation](https://bigprof.com/appgini/help/advanced-topics/hooks)
for more details.

Great new for anyone interested in this project, a US appeals court has recently reaffirmed that web scraping is legal!!

https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/amp/

I am currently a bit busy with other projects but hope to return to update it shortly.

Please get in touch if you are interested in helping me take this project forward.


## [Demo of PropertyWebScraper ](https://homestocompare.com/)

Previously there was a demo at [https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com](https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/)

I have had to take that down as heroku has cancelled thier free tier.  You can see it being used in production here though: [https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)

To use Property Web Scraper as a service you would make calls like:

[https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/retriever/as_json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightmove.co.uk%2Fproperty-for-sale%2Fproperty-68790657.html](https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/retriever/as_json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightmove.co.uk%2Fproperty-for-sale%2Fproperty-68790657.html)

## Support for importing properties from an MLS

PropertyWebScraper also supports connecting to different MLSs (Multiple Listing Services) in the US using RETS and Web Services.  This functionality is currently experimental and has only been implemented for 3 MLSs.  If there is a particular MLS for which you need support, open an issue with the details.   

## Rails Version

PropertyWebScraper runs with Rails >= 5.0

## Ruby Version

PropertyWebScraper runs with Ruby >= 2.0.0.

This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the results presented in the following paper:

* M. De Nadai, B. Lepri. *The economic value of neighborhoods: Predicting real estate prices from the urban environment*, 2018.

Input, intermediary and source data can be downloaded from [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6934970).

# Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file at the root of the repository. Using [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) all the required dependencies can be installed automatically.

``` sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* [PostgreSQL 10.0](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
* [PostGIS 2.4.1](https://postgis.net) extension

# Data

Due to storage constraints, input data are not integrated to this repository. However, input and intermediary files required to run the analysis can be downloaded from a [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6934970). To run the following code, input and/or the intermediary files must be downloaded and placed in the folder. 
Then, do:

``` sh
createdb dsaa
gunzip < intermediate_db_backup.sql.gz | psql dsaa
tar -xf data.tar -C data/
```

Then place the content of dsaa_census_areas.zip into `data/generated_files/`.

To produce the intermediary files, go to the section ""DIY Instructions"".

# Code

The code of the analysis in divided in two parts: the Python scripts and modules used to support the analysis, and the notebooks where the outputs of the analysis have been produced.

## Scripts

* `data_processing_houses.ipynb` : script used for the pre-processing of Immobiliare.it data.
* `compute_walkability.py` : script used to generate the walkability scores for each census area.
* `data_processing_neighborhood.py` : script used to create all the dataset.
* `predict.py` : script used to predict the housing value from the intermediary files.
* `plots.ipynb` : script used to produce the images of the manuscript.


## License
This code is licensed under the MIT license. 


# DIY Instructions

Here we generate the entire database from ground. To do so, we have to create the minimal setup from this command:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/minimal.sql
psql dsaa < data/SQL/minimal_materialize.sql
```

## Additional dependencies
* [osm2pgsql 0.95.0-dev](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql)
* [osrm v5.17.0](http://project-osrm.org/)
* [Security perception dependencies](https://github.com/denadai2/google_street_view_deep_neural)

## Census data
Census data have to complay to the format of the `census_areas_onfocus` table. Only when you did import data to this table you can proceed with all the steps. When you imported the data, you can generate the spatial matrix here:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/first-DIY-step.sql
```


## Walkability
A OpenStreetMap file has to be downloaded (preferably from [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm)), and placed in `data/OSM`. Then they are imported in PostGIS with:

``` sh
osm2pgsql -c -d dsaa --create --style ""config/osm2pgsql.style"" --multi-geometry --number-processes 5 --latlong -C 30000 [FILENAME].osm.pbf
```

The same file OSM file can then be used to produce the OSRM database:

``` sh
osrm-extract -p config/profiles/foot.lua [FILENAME].osm.pbf
osrm-contract [FILENAME].osrm
```

To run the server, use the command

``` sh
osrm-routed [FILENAME].osrm
```

After this everything is set up to create the intermediate data in the database. Import all the materialized view, then run the script. Before running it, personalize line 13 and 35 of `compute_walkability.py`.

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/walkability.sql
python3 compute_walkability.py
```

## Security perception
To create the security perception scores, we use the code and weights of the following paper:

* De Nadai, M., Vieriu, R. L., Zen, G., Dragicevic, S., Naik, N., Caraviello, M., ... & Lepri, B. *Are safer looking neighborhoods more lively?: A multimodal investigation into urban life*. In ACM MM 2016.

Everything is available [here](https://github.com/denadai2/google_street_view_deep_neural). All the prediction should be placed inside the `placepulse` table in PostgreSQL. Then, you can impor/refresh the materialized view present here:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/security.sql
```

## Companies
You can insert a dataset with the census areas (`geoid`) and a proxy of companies earnings (`fatturato`) in `data/companies.csv`. Pay attention that this is included only in the non-open model version.

## Land value
You can insert a dataset with the census areas (`geoid`) and a proxy of land value (`assessed_land_value`) in `data/land_value.csv`. Pay attention that this is included only in the non-open model version.

## Census
Census data has to be inserted with the same format as the files placed in `data/census` and `data/census/industry`. To change this, change the corrisponding code at `data_processing_housing.py`.

## Land use
Download satellite shapefiles from https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/urban-atlas-2012/view. Import them in the `urban_atlas` PostgreSQL table. Then run the code:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/urban_atlas.sql
```

summera,retscli,,https://github.com/summera/retscli,https://api.github.com/repos/retscli/summera,CLI for querying RETS servers and searching metadata.,"# retscli

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/retscli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/retscli)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/summera/retscli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/summera/retscli)

CLI for querying RETS servers and searching metadata.

This gem is built on top of the [rets](http://github.com/estately/rets) gem, which handles the actual querying and parsing of the RETS server requests. Big thanks to the [Estately](http://www.estately.com) team for their work!

![retscli gif](https://github.com/summera/gifs/blob/master/retscli/search_metadata_cropped.gif?raw=true)
![retscli png](https://github.com/summera/gifs/blob/master/retscli/search.png?raw=true)

## Installation
    $ gem install retscli

## Features
- Search metadata for keywords. Results are highlighted for readability.
- Search resources. Results are displayed in a nicely formatted ascii table.
- Open command results in your editor of choice.
- Debug RETS requests and queries in debug mode.
- Command results are paged using less by default.

## Usage

#### CLI Commands
```bash
$ retscli help
Commands:
  retscli capabilities [LOGIN URL]  # Display capabilities for rets server
  retscli console [LOGIN URL]       # Start rets console
  retscli help [COMMAND]            # Describe available commands or one specific command
  retscli validate [LOGIN URL]      # Validate rets credentials
```

To see the available flags/options, run help on the command

```bash
$ retscli help console
Usage:
  retscli console [LOGIN URL]

Options:
  -u, [--username=USERNAME]        # Username
  -p, [--password=PASSWORD]        # Password
  -v, [--version=VERSION]          # Rets version
                                   # Default: RETS/1.7.2
  -a, [--agent=AGENT]              # User agent
  -t, [--ua-password=UA_PASSWORD]  # User agent password
  -d, [--debug], [--no-debug]      # Debug mode

Start rets console
```

#### Debug Mode
To view requests being made to the RETS server, enable debug mode with the `-d` flag. Once enabled, helpful info will be logged to `$stdout`. This is helpful to debug errors thrown by the RETS server and to adjust queries.

#### Rets Console Commands
After dropping into the RETS console, you get a bunch of useful commands for searching and exploring the RETS server

```bash
$ retscli console http://rets.server.com -u summera -p password

summera@rets.server.com > help
Commands:
  capabilities                       # Display capabilities for rets server
  classes [RESOURCE]                 # List available classes for resource
  help [COMMAND]                     # Describe available commands or one specific command
  login                              # Re-Login to RETS server. Use if session is no longer valid
  metadata                           # View metadata
  objects [RESOURCE]                 # List available objects for resource
  resources                          # List available resources
  search [RESOURCE] [CLASS] [QUERY]  # Search resources, e.g. properties, open houses, etc.
  search-metadata                    # Search metadata tables
  tables [RESOURCE] [CLASS]          # List available tables for class of resource
  timezone-offset                    # System timezone offset
```

Again, to see available flags/options, run help on the command. Many of the commands have an `editor` option if you feel the need to get down and dirty in your editor of choice.


```bash
summera@rets.server.com > help search-metadata
Usage:
  search-metadata

Options:
  -r, [--resources=one two three]  # Filter metadata by resources
  -c, [--classes=one two three]    # Filter metadata by classes
  -e, [--editor=EDITOR]            # Open search results in editor

Search metadata tables
```

## Notes
- When opening output in your editor, retscli will check the `$EDITOR` environment variable. If this is not set, it falls back to nano.
- Much of the output is piped through `less` by default to allow for easy paging. If you'd like to change this, set your preferred pager in the `$PAGER` environment variable.
- Retscli uses the ruby readline module for the rets console.
- If any arguments and/or options have spaces in them, you will need to wrap them in quotes so that retscli does not split on the spaces.

Notes about JDK versions below 11
---------------------------------

JAXB is bundled with JDK 8, was disabled / deprecated in JDK 9 & 10 and finally removed in JDK 11. Therefore, we're providing JAXB as an explicit dependency. See also [""JAXB on Java 9, 10, 11 and beyond""](https://www.jesperdj.com/2018/09/30/jaxb-on-java-9-10-11-and-beyond/).

It is recommended to use this library with JDK 11 as it should work out of the box. In case you're using JDK 8, you might need to follow one of these steps documented at [""JAXB Release Documentation""](https://javaee.github.io/jaxb-v2/doc/user-guide/release-documentation.html#deployment-migrating-jaxb-2-0-applications-to-javase-6):

> JavaSE comes with JAXB 2.x API/implementation in `rt.jar`. Each version of JavaSE (6, 7, 8, ...) contains different version of JAXB 2.x API. Therefore, if you want to use different version of JAXB API/implementation than the one present in your version of JDK, you are required to override a portion of `rt.jar` with the new API. There are several ways to achieve this:
>
> 1.    Place the `jakarta.xml.bind-api-X.Y.Z.jar` into `$JRE_HOME/lib/endorsed`. **Do not put other JAXB jars into the endorsed directory.** This essentially makes your JRE to ""JRE X + JAXB 2.y"". This would affect any other applications that use this JRE, and it's easy. On the other hand, in various scenarios you may not be able to alter the JRE.
>
> 2.    Use the system property `java.endorsed.dirs` when you launch your application, and have it point to the directory which contains the `jakarta.xml.bind-api-X.Y.Z.jar` only. **The directory must not contain any other jaxb artifacts.** This allows you to use different version of JAXB for different applications.
>
> See the [endorsed directory mechanism](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/standards/) for more details.

All provided dependencies should work with JDK 8. If compatibility problems occur, you might replace them with an earlier version.

WillowTwin open digital twin definition language (DTDL) ontology for buildings and real estate

## Prerequisites

Before getting started:
* Install a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to view, manage, and update the files.
* Install git to allow for cloning and working with this repo and its submodules. For Windows, we recommend [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
* Learn [basic git techniques](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git) such as creating a branching, committing, pulling, and pushing.
* Learn about the [Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL//dtdlv2.md) which defines the language used to describe models of digital twins.
* Learn about the [DTDL-based RealEstateCore ontology](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building) which forms the base ontology from which this WillowTwin ontology extends.
* Learn about [Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/) which is the service WillowTwin is built upon and this ontology gets loaded into as [Models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-models).

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo and its submodules to your local machine by running `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

    NOTE: This project includes `git submodules` which are references to other repos. If this repo was cloned by default, such as running `git clone`, this project will only include the directories of the submodules but not the files within them yet. To initialize and pull down the submodule files, run the command: `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Read more about working with submodules [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

* After successfully cloning the submodules, there should be files in the following directories:

    | Submodule | Description |
    | --------- | ----------- |
    | DTDL-Validator | Tool to parse and validate the DTDL ontology |
    | Ontology\opendigitaltwins-building | DTDL-based RealEstateCore ontology |

* Confirm all of the DTDL files have been pulled to your local machine by running the [DTDL Validator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/DTDL-Validator) self-contained executable. The output should include **Validated all files - Your DTDL is valid**. After making changes to the DTDL files, it is recommended to run this command prior to committing changes.

* Start browsing the Ontology which has the following top-level directories:

    | Directory | Description |
    | --------- | ----------- |
    | opendigitaltwins-building\Ontology | DTDL-based RealEstateCore ontology. This is the base set of DTDL models from which the Willow models extend |
    | Willow | This is the set of WillowTwin DTDL models which are used for creating digital twins |

    NOTE: When creating twins in the WillowTwin, they are always based on a Willow DTDL model id which begins with `dtmi:com:willowinc:`.

## Key Concepts

### Ontology Overview

A model which **extends** another model recusively inherits all of the Properties, Relationships, and Components from the referenced model. The following table describes the set of top-level models for this ontology. These form the base from which all other models extend.

| Model | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Agent | Any basic types of stakeholder that can have roles or perform activities, e.g., people, companies, departments. |
| Asset | An object such which is located inside (or outside) a building, but is not an integral part of that building's structure, for example architectural, furniture, and equipment. Assets are typically products that have a manufacturer, model, and serial number |
| Building Component | A part that constitutes a piece of a building's structural makeup, for example Facade, Wall, Slab, RoofInner, etc. These are typically constructed onsite. |
| Capability | A capability indicates the capacity of a entity, be it a Space, an Asset, or a LogicalDevice, to produce or ingest data. This is equivalent to the term ""point"" in Brick Schema and generic Building Management System. Specific subclasses specialize this behavior: Sensor entities harvest data from the real world, Actuator entities accept commands from a digital twin platform, and Parameter entities configure some capability or system. |
| Collection | An administrative grouping of entities that are addressed and treated as a unit for some purpose. These entities may have some spatial arrangement (e.g., a Tenant Unit is typically contiguous), however that is not a requirement (see, e.g., a distributed Campus consisting of spatially disjoint plots or buildings). |
| Document | A formal piece of written, printed or electronic matter that provides information or evidence or that serves as an official record, for example LeaseContract, Building Specification, Warranty, Drawing, etc. |
|Event | A spatiotemporally indexed entity with participants, something which occurs somewhere, and that has or takes some time, for example a Lease or Rent. |
| Space | A contiguous part of the physical world that has a 3D spatial extent and that contains or can contain sub-spaces. For example a Region can contain many pieces of Land, which in turn can contain many Buildings, which in turn can contain Levels and Rooms. |

NOTE: Many of the models include **Components**. These are not intended to be instantiated as digital twins. They can be thought of as a reusable interface by many models or a folder to organize a related set of Properties and Relationships.

Models define the possible set of Properties, Relationships, and Components that a twin may have; however, a twin does not have to include all of these at runtime. A twin is only required to have an **id** and a reference **model**.

### Relationships

Relationships between twins are what give the WillowTwin its powerful capabilities to action data. The more relationships that exist in for a given set of twins, also known as a greater graph density, the more opportunity there is for descriptive, presctiptive, predicitive, and real-time analtyics.

We encourage twins to be created and updated with as many relationships as possible; however, it is important that users (and machines) creating twins have a common understanding of the real-world meaning of relationships just as they should have a common understanding of the real-world meaning of models. Having this alignment allows for the highest accuracy of the analytics and thus trust in the outcomes that are actioned and surfaced by the data.

Here are the commmon relationships found in the ontology:

| Relationship | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| isPartOf | A simplified set of topological relations to connect sub- and super-entities within the top-level RealEstateCore interface tree. ""isPartOf"" operates on entities of the same type, for example Spaces have only Spaces as parts, Assets have only Assets as parts, etc. |
| isCapabilityOf | Indicates that a Space, Asset or LogicalDevice has the ability to produce or ingest data represented by sensors, actuators or parameters. |
| includedIn | Indicates that an entity is included in some Collection, for example a Building is included in a RealEstate, or an Asset is included in a System. |
| locatedIn | Indicates that a given Asset is physically located in a Space. |
| hostedBy | Indicates that a capability or logical device is hosted by another entity such as an asset. |
| servedBy | The coverage or area impacted by a given Asset or Sensor/Actuator. Note that Assets can also service one another. |
| isFedBy | Indicates that a given equipment or space is fed ""something"" by another equipment, like electricity, water or air. |
| hasDocument | Indicates that an entity has accompanying details or references in a Document such as a Drawing, Product Data, Warranty, or Lease Contract. |

Here are examples of how to use relationships:

| Relationship | Examples |
| ------------ | ------- |
| isPartOf | Room-->isPartOf-->Level<br>Room-->isPartof-->HVACZone |
| isCapabilityOf | ZoneAirTemperatureSetpoint-->isCapabilityOf-->FanPoweredBox<br>PeopleCountSensor-->isCapabilityOf-->OccupancyZone |
| includedIn | FanPoweredBox-->includedIn-->HVACSupplyAirSystem<br>DomesticWaterPump-->includedIn-->PlumbingPumpGroup<br>Building-->includedIn-->Portfolio |
| locatedIn | Workstation-->locatedIn-->Room<br>AirHandlingUnit-->locatedIn-->Level |
| hostedBy | ZoneAirTemperatureSetpoint-->hostedBy-->BACnetController<br>ElectricalEnergySensor-->hostedby-->ModbusController |
| servedBy | OccupancyZone-->servedBy--PeopleCountSensorEquipment<br>Room-->servedBy-->VideoSurveillanceCamera<br>Level-->servedBy-->Elevator |
| isFedBy | FireSprinklerHead-->isFedBy-->SprinklerValve<br>Sink-->isFedBy-->ElectricTankWaterHeater<br>Luminaire-->isFedBy-->ElectricalCircuit1Pole |
| hasDocument | AirHandlingUnit-->hasDocument-->Warranty<br>HVACChilledWaterSystem-->hasDocument-->TestReport<br>Level-->hasDocument-->AsBuiltDrawing |

Relationships can also have properties with all of the same semantics as properties on twins. This is an powerful feature of DTDL which allows for the graph to better model the real world. In this ontology, the **isFedBy** relationship defined on [Equipment](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building/blob/master/Ontology/Asset/Equipment/Equipment.json), [HVACZone](https://github.com/WillowInc/opendigitaltwins-building/blob/main/Ontology/Willow/Space/Zone/HVACZone.json), and [LightingZone](https://github.com/WillowInc/opendigitaltwins-building/blob/main/Ontology/Willow/Space/Zone/LightingZone.json) has a property **substance** which defines what is being fed such as **SupplyAir**, **HotDomesticWater**, **ACElec**, or **Light**. This property has been defined as an Enum such that the allowed values for substance must come from the list defined in the above models.

NOTE: We recommend that the **substance** proeperty be defined on all **isFedBy** relationships to enable the best WillowTwin user experience. We also recommend using the most descriptive **substance** such as **SupplyAir** instead of **Air** and **SprinklerWater**instead of **Water**.

## Samples

For more in-depth examples of common scenarios, visit the [Samples](Samples).

These include diagrams and accompanying narratives to learn how to organize the data, what models should be used when creating twins, and the types of relationships between the twins.

## Frequency Asked Questions

**How do I determine which model to use when deciding between a model which extends another?**

It is recommended to be as specific as possible when creating twins to provide the most detailed classification. As such, the ""child"" model which extends the ""parent"" should always be used. For example, when creating a twin of a Fan Powered Box that is known to have a heating element, the model `dtmi:com:willowinc:FanPoweredBoxReheat;1` should be used instead of a more generic model from which it extends such as `dtmi:willowinc:TerminalUnit;1`, `dtmi:willowinc:VAVBox;1`, or `dtmi:willowinc:FanPoweredBox;1`.

**How do I determine whether to use a given relationship or its inverse?**

In general, relationships should be defined on the ""children"" twins with an outgoing relationship to a common ""parent"". For example, there are typically many rooms on a building level so the relationship would be defined as `Room-->isPartOf-->Level`. Similarly, there are many luminaires fed by an electrical circuit so the relationship would be defined as `Luminaire-->isFedBy-->ElectricalCircuit1Pole`.

## gHomes allows your players to rent/purchase houses or apartments.

GHomes is provided with strong and easy-to-use tools which will allow you to quickly add -if the map you're using is not supported yet- houses or apartments to your favorite map.

You can either buy/rent the home/apartment directly on it's front panel or go to the NPC selling them, you can also disable the panels in the config to force the players to use the Seller.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Buy houses from multiple way (Each way can be disabled in the settings/ or by not spawning the npc)

*   [**From the 3D2D panel**](https://i.imgur.com/YbCrFH2.gifv)
*   [**From the 2D panel like darkrp using F2**](https://youtu.be/BvZJrLRlv8c)
*   [**Or from the NPC**](https://i.imgur.com/CKlQ9zs.gif)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Let the players rent or purchase properties (You do like : max rental = 3 days, autosell after not connected after _x_ days in the config)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Let the players decide for how much days they rent the home (You can disable each mode individually for each house)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) As a player, renew the lease before it expires

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Auto props saving for the owner of the house/apartment every minutes

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Auto keys management, directly use them, no F2 or door linking bullshit

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Add co-owners, allow them to open/close doors and spawn props

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) With the 3D Panel, ring the doorbell and leave messaged to the owner or the co-owners, they will be able to read them directly on it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) If the player didn't connect for X days (in the config) the property/house/whatever he owns is sold.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Sexy booting animation for the tool (you'll see it only once, don't worry)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) **[NEW]** You can now edit houses (daily price, perma price, name etc) directly with the NPC

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) **[NEW]** Players can now rent houses in hours not just in days

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) **[NEW]** You can enable the ""sell-on-leave"" mode to get a darkrp vanilla experience and still make it easier for your players to buy houses

Even if the tool to add homes is easy as hell to use, [ready-to use maps files](https://i.imgur.com/7YyTCFL.png) are provided with the addon, more will come in the future, but keep in mind using [the tools](https://youtu.be/oD2ZUGqk5_M) is really easy.

All existing map are supported, there is nothing as an ""unsupported map"", the tools are easy as fuck to use, really

(I know it's supposed to be X per day and not per day**s**, it's fixed in the addon but i'm too lazy to re-record it)

_sexy booting animation which you will see only once ;), don't worry about seeing it evertime to use the tool_

# Compatibility and other stuff

*   INCOMPATIBLE WITH [Advanced Lock & Lockpicking System](https://www.gmodstore.com/scripts/view/1025) Because his hook is overwriting stuff

ryansherby,RedfinScraper,,https://github.com/ryansherby/RedfinScraper,https://api.github.com/repos/RedfinScraper/ryansherby,Scrapes Redfin data.,"Ôªø# Redfin Scraper

## Description
A scalable Python library that leverages Redfin's unofficial Stringray API to quickly scrape real estate data.

## One-Time Setup
### Zip Code Database
> A database of zip codes is required to search for City, State values  

> It is strongly recommended to download this [free](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/#) version in .csv format
### The Config
> Parameters for the RedfinScraper class can be controlled using an optional `config.json` file  

> [Sample Config](https://github.com/ryansherby/RedfinScraper/blob/main/config.json)



## Getting Started
### Installation
`pip3 install -U redfin-scraper`

### Import Module
`from redfin_scraper import RedfinScraper`  

### Initialize Module
`scraper = RedfinScraper()`

## Using The Scraper
### Required Setup
`scraper.setup(zip_database_path:str, multiprocessing:bool=False)`

> **zip_database_path**: Binary path to the zip_code_database.csv  

> **multiprocessing**: Allow for multiprocessing

### Activating The Scraper
`scraper.scrape(city_states:list[str]=None, zip_codes:list[str], sold:bool=False, sale_period:str=None, lat_tuner:float=1.5, lon_tuner:float=1.5)`
>**city_states**: List of strings representing US cities formatted as ""City, State""  

>**zip_codes**: List of strings representing US zip codes  

>**sold**: Select whether to scrape for-sale data (default) or sold data  

>**sale_period**: Must be selected whenever sold is True (1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1yr, 3yr, 5yr)

>**lat_tuner**: Represents # of standard deviations beyond the local latitude average that a zip code may exist within   

>**lon_tuner**: Represents # of standard deviations beyond the local longitude average that a zip code may exist within  

### Accessing Prior Scrapes
`scraper.get_data(id:str)`
>**id**: IDs are indexed at 1 and increase in the format ""D00#""

## Appendix
### Warnings
> Multiprocessing can result in the consumption of all available CPU resources for an extended period of time  

> Unethical use of this library can result in Redfin taking disciplinary action against your IP address  

### Recommendations
> Requests for large amounts of data (# of zip codes > 2,000) should be split into separate requests  

> The `package.log` file can be used to investigate unexpected results

<h5 align=""center""><i>real-estate data prediction & analysis</i>
</h5>
A robust application providing support for predicting and detecting land quality & cover, its optimal usage for building flats or property, its generative model and optimal paths to electric/water/sewage reserve.

# Features

- **Land Cover** : Real estate agents find it difficult to predict and determine the land quality and optimal cover.
- **External supplies** : Finding optimized path for external supplies like electricity, water or sewage reserves.
- **Optimal usage** : [COMING SOON] Optimal usage of land for predicting the maximum number of flats and bunglows possible to fit into a chosen plot.
- **Generating usages** : [UNDER EXPERIMENATION] To generate usages of the plot based on demands by the real estate agents and clients.

# Implementation

1. For classifying the land cover and usage the Resnet50 Architecture along with OpenCV's CVT Threshold.
2. For finding the land cover, semantic segmenation of Land is performed on aerial images for masking the image to suitable classes.
3. For finding the optimal and best route between two points in an aerial image we use the Djikstra Algorithm in the road segmented image of the satellite imagery with an added algorithm which ignores the region with black pixels and finds the best path among the white pixels.
4. We plan to use Generative Adverserial Networks for generating best plot plan of the chosen area for giving a complete finish plan to the real-estate agents.


### Future Plan

- Add GANs generated blueprints for construction on land site
- Dynamic Pricing model for predicting real time price predictions based on demand and availability.
- Implementing bridge with nearby sources for particular usages of tools.
- Implementing better Semantic Segmentation models for better optimal usage functionality.
- Implementing real-time deployment with added security.
- Usage of A-Star or better algorithms in finding the best optimal path between the source and reserves.

pip install -e .
```

There are no unit tests or documentation currently, we're working on that.

## Integration

+ At this time, I am able to integrate with seloger.com and Google Sheets.
+ I am currently in the process of implementing support for Leboncoin.
+ If you would like me to integrate with any other third-party platforms, please submit a request in the form of an issue.
+ Additional integrations beyond seloger.com and Google Sheets are being considered and are open for request through the creation of an issue.
+ Your suggestions will be taken into consideration and evaluated for feasibility and compatibility with my current system.
+ We appreciate your feedback and suggestions as it helps us to improve and expand my capabilities to better serve you!

### You can actually write your own integration based on defaults abstract classes located at the root of the package :

- 'RealEstateService' for data acquisition

## Context

Immoweb is the leading real estate classified ads website in Belgium. However, items disappear once they are sold or rented. If you want to be able to keep forever all the information about items (including description, photos and structured data such as PEB, bedroom count, price), you've come to the right place ! Immoweb Keeper, provided that you run it on a schedule (such as every day) and that you provide one or more search criteria, will automatically download all the new items matching those criteria and even redownload ones that were updated.

You are then free to analyse the long-term market trends, such as the evolution of price/transaction volume/average bedroom count/surface etc. in specific area over a specific time period. That part is still up to you as of today : you could use MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Charts to quickly analyse the data, use a front-end data vizualization framework to build an interactive webpage or use any other data vizualization tool.

## How to use

### Requirements

- You need to have Node.js and npm installed
- You need to have an instance of MongoDb installed on your machine

### Setup config

- Go to the root project directory using terminal & run `npm install`
- Make sure your MongoDB instance is running (you can run `mongod`)
- Modify the `config.env` file to match your MongoBD connection string, such as :
  ```sh
  MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
  MONGODB_DATABASE=immoweb
  ```
- Create a `config.json` file with the following items :
  * `imageRepository` : the path on your filesystem where you would like the items' images to be downloaded
  * `searchURLs` : just go to http://www.immoweb.be, choose you criterias and paste the url once you are on the search results page, OR :
  
  * `searchQueries` : an alternative, more structured way of storing the search criteria than the search url (the filter names are those from immoweb urls query params) 
 
  ```json
  {
    ""imageRepository"": ""~/immoweb/photos"",
    ""searchURLs"": [
        ""https://www.immoweb.be/en/search/house/for-rent?countries=BE&postalCodes=BE-1140&orderBy=relevance"",
        ""https://www.immoweb.be/en/search/apartment/for-rent?countries=BE&minBedroomCount=1&propertySubtypes=KOT%2CFLAT_STUDIO&page=1&orderBy=relevance""
    ],
    ""searchQueries"": [{
            ""propertyTypes"": [""HOUSE""],
            ""postalCodes"": [1030, 1040, 1140],
            ""maxPrice"": 600000,
            ""minBedroomCount"": 3
        }, {
            ""propertyTypes"": [""GARAGE""],
            ""postalCodes"": [1030, 1040, 1140]
        }]
  }
  ```

### Run download routine

Execute `npm run routine` to start the download routine.

Ideally, you should setup a cron job to execute the routine daily (there are various ways of achieving this depending on your OS).

All the structured data and the pictures will be respectively stored in your MongoDB database and on your hard drive.

Then, it's up to you to decide how you want to xplore : you can use the front-end described in next section to explore the results, or you can setup any data vizualisation tool.

It is good to know that :
- The first time you include a search query/url in the config and run Immoweb Keeper, it will browse through all search results matching that criteria
- The next times, Immoweb Keeper will sort the results from the most recently to the least recently updated item, and stop browsing the results when it reaches an item that has not been updated since the last time you runned Immoweb Keeper

### Run visualisation page

- Execute ``npm run server`` to setup the server that will expose the data from your MongoDB
  * if you want to use another port than 5000, you can override the default port in ``config.env``

- Execute ``npm run client`` and the React ImmowebKeeper website will pop up in your default browser and allow you to explore the results !
  * use the filters on top to dive into your results
  * currently, the filtering is done on all the results that exist in your database, no distinction is made between the different search queries
  * lots of improvements and optimizations yet to come !

## Data model

If the provided front-end is a bit light for your needs, you are free to explore the data with any tool you want. Here is a documentation of how the data is structured in the MongoDB database :

### Collection `estates`

#### Subdocument `rawMetadata`

Whereas the first level structure is guaranteed by Immoweb Keeper, the *rawMetadata* field structure could change without notice in the case of Immoweb changing things in their data structure. Only a change in the lastModificationDate and id (which holds the immoweb code) would break the Immoweb Keeper routine as it uses them for indexing data and knowing when to stop to browse results. Any other modification in the structure would just make the afterhand data analysis more difficult.

## How does it work ?

- All the structured data about real estate items will be stored in your **immoweb** MongoDB database (in collections **estates**)
- All the item pictures will be downloaded to your image repository folder, in subfolders named after their immoweb codes
- The details (url, list of criteria, last run date) of the search query will be stored as documents the *queries* collection of the *immoweb* database, along with the last time when it was runned

Here is the overview of how the code is organized. When you run it, the script will :

- Create a database called *immoweb* in your mongodb instance specified in *mongoDBUrl* (if it does not exist already)
- Create the folder for the image repository as mentioned in *imageRepository* (if it does not exist already)
- For each of your search result's URLs or structured queries, it will then :
  - Get the last run date from the *queries* collection of the *immoweb* mongodb
  - Add a filter to sort results from the most to the least recently updated/created
  - For each page of results, it will extract all the immoweb codes and for each of them, it will :
    - Get the JSON metadata provided by immoweb in the source code of the item webpage
    - Get the lastModificationDate from the metadata : if it is older than the last run date of this query, go on with the next query
    - Get all the item's pictures' urls from the media.pictures item from the metadata
    - Download all pictures to the path *<imageRepository>/<immowebCode>/<pictureName>.jpg*
    - Create a new document in the *estate* collection of the *immoweb* database with the immoweb metadata wrapped with other data (cf next section)
  - Save the current date and time as the last run date for that query in the *query* collection of the *immoweb* database

## Work in progress...

The download routine is working fully, but the front-end visualization page, although working, is still under construction : only a few filters exist, the retrieval of items from the database is far from efficient and there is no way to select for which query we want to see the results : the filters work on the basis of the full set of data and their min/max/allowed values (price range, list of zip codes) does not change according to the bounds that we can find in the database.",20,20,4,28,real-estate,"[immoweb, mongodb, nodejs, real-estate, scraper]",0

Movin' In is a Rental Property Management Platform with a backend for managing properties, customers and bookings, a frontend and a mobile app for renting properties.

Movin' In is designed to work with multiple agencies. Agencies can manage their properties and bookings from the backend. Movin' In can also work with only one agency as well.

From the backend, administrators can create and manage agencies, properties, locations, users and bookings.

When new agencies are created, they receive an email prompting them to create their account to access the backend and manage their properties, customers and bookings.

Customers can sign up from the frontend or the mobile app, search for available properties based on location point and time, choose a property and complete the checkout process.

A key design decision was made to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript due to its numerous advantages. TypeScript offers strong typing, tooling, and integration, resulting in high-quality, scalable, more readable and maintainable code that is easy to debug and test.

Python wrapper and scraper for the Realtor.ca website. Use it to scrape Canadian real-estate listings easily.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the package requirements.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/harry-s-grewal/mls-real-estate-scraper-for-realtor.ca.git
```

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harry-s-grewal/mls-real-estate-scraper-for-realtor.ca.git
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./mls-real-estate-scraper-for-realtor.ca/requirements.txt
```

## Context
Realtor.ca has two API endpoints: `PropertySearch_Post` and `PropertyDetails`. Querying `PropertySearch_Post` 
will return a list of properties in a .json format, including some limited details. Querying `PropertyDetails` will provide detailed information on each property. Depending on what you're looking for, you can query one or the other, but be aware that getting details on each property is slow. That's because Realtor.ca is rate limited (boo). If you make too many queries too often, you'll receive an `Error 403: Unauthorized` error. It's not clear what the rate limit is, but waiting an hour or so between limits stops the freeze-out.

## Usage
In `queries.py` you will find queries to Realtor.ca for both the `PropertySearch_Post` endpoint and the `PropertyDetails` endpoint. It also contains a query to get the coordinate bounding box of a city, as that's what Realtor.ca uses to determine which properties to list.

In `realtorca.py` there are two functions to automate the scraping of Realtor.ca.

`get_property_list_by_city()` will scrape a list of properties by city and save it as a .csv.
```python
get_property_list_by_city(""Calgary, AB"")
```

Result:
```bash
CalgaryAB.csv
```
`get_property_details_from_csv()` will use that .csv file to get property listing details to enhance the data already available.
```python
get_property_list_by_city(""CalgaryAB.csv"")
```

The API is built using Python, Django and Django Rest Framework.","
Homemix - A Real Estate API (This project is still a work in progress).
========

Homemix is a RESTful API that enables users to buy and sell properties with ease. It provides endpoints for CRUD operations on real estate listings, making it simple for users to create, read, update, and delete listings.

- URL: https://homemix-api.onrender.com
- Documentaion - https://homemix-api.onrender.com/redoc/


Features Explained
------------------

With Homemix, users can list properties with detailed information, including property type, address, price, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, description, photos, availability, and contact information. This makes it easy for potential buyers to search for properties that meet their specific needs and requirements.

Homemix also provides advanced search and filtering capabilities, allowing users to search for properties based on parameters such as location, price, number of bedrooms, and more. The API supports pagination for large datasets, with customizable page size and page number parameters, making it easy to view large amounts of data.

Users can register as either a buyer or seller and are provided with secure authentication and authorization through the use of token-based authentication. This ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive information and the ability to manipulate data.

Homemix is built with Django Rest Framework (DRF), a powerful and flexible framework for building APIs in Django. This makes it easy to extend and customize the API to meet specific needs, and provides comprehensive documentation and examples to get you started quickly.

With its advanced search and filtering capabilities, secure authentication, and support for multiple media types, Homemix is the ideal solution for anyone looking to buy or sell properties with ease.

In addition to the features mentioned above, Homemix now also includes a referral system. Users can generate a unique referral code and share it with their friends or family. When a new user signs up using the referral code, both the referring user and the new user receive a reward or incentive.

Users can view a list of all the users they have referred, providing transparency and accountability. This encourages existing users to invite others to the platform and helps to grow the user base.

Overall, Homemix offers a comprehensive solution for buying and selling properties, with a user-friendly interface and advanced features to make the process as smooth and efficient as possible.


Why Homemix?
--------

The creation of Homemix is a personal project for me as it has roots in my family's background in the real estate industry. Growing up, my parents ran a traditional real estate business and I have always wanted to create something that would solve some of the problems they faced and make their work easier.

I saw an opportunity to use my skills in software development to build an API that would streamline the process of buying and selling properties. With Homemix, I aim to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly platform that makes it easy to list properties and search for properties that meet their needs.

The project holds a special place in my heart because it allows me to give back to my parents and the real estate community. I am passionate about creating a clean, well-secured API that will make a positive impact on the industry. I believe that the features and capabilities offered by Homemix will greatly benefit both buyers and sellers, and I am excited to see the impact it will have.

In short, Homemix is a project that brings together my passion for real estate and my skills in software development. I am confident that it will make a positive difference in the industry and I look forward to seeing it grow and evolve over time.


Technical Overview
------------------

The platform uses the following technologies to gather and display the pricing data:

-   Django: A web framework used to handle the back-end and interact with the database.
-   Uses Django RestFramework for building RESTful APIs
-   Implements standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interacting with the API.
-   Database: To store the user and property data for quick and easy retrieval.
-   Supports authentication and authorization using Simple JWT. A JSON Web Token authentication plugin for the Django REST Framework.
-   Serialization of data using DRF's serializers
-   Supports pagination of results using DRF's built-in pagination classes
-   Provides documentation of the API using drf-yasg - Yet Another Swagger Generator. 


Security Layers
------------------

- ALLOWED_HOSTS.
- CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS.
- Authentication.
- Authorization.
- API throttling - User-based request rate limiting. 
- Implemented request validation and filtering - Serialization of data.


Sending Emails
------------------

This project currently use django.core.mail module and console email backend. You can change it to your prefered email backend.


Installation
------------

Here are the steps to install and set up the Homemix real estate API project locally:

1. Clone the repository: First, you will need to clone the Homemix repository to your local machine. This can be done using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/homemix.git
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment: It is recommended to work with a virtual environment to keep the dependencies for this project separate from other projects on your system. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m venv homemix-env
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
    ```bash
    source homemix-env/bin/activate (for Mac or Linux)
    ```

    ```bash
    source homemix-env\Scripts\activate (for Windows)
    ```
3. Install dependencies: Next, you will need to install the dependencies required for the project. These dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set up the database: The Homemix API uses the Django ORM to interact with a database. By default, the project uses PostgreSQL as the database or you could use any database of your choice. Run these commands to make migrations:
     ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
  
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
5. Create a superuser: To access the Django admin interface, you will need to create a superuser. You can do this by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
6. Run the development server: Once the installation and setup are complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  
  The Homemix API should now be running at http://localhost:8000/. You can access the Django admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin/.
  
  
Running Unit Tests
------------

After making any changes to the code, it's important to run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2. Enter the following command to run the tests:

     ```bash
    python manage.py tests
    ```
3. Wait for the tests to complete. If any tests fail, you will see an error message in the terminal.
4. Make sure that all tests are passing before pushing any changes to the codebase.

### <span style=""color:red"">_This component requires HA Core version 2021.6.0 or greater!_</span>

This is a _Custom Integration_ for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It uses the unofficial [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com) API to get property value estimates.

There currently is support for the Sensor device type within Home Assistant.

## Installation

### HACS installation

This Integration is part of the default HACS store, so go to the HACS page and search for _Redfin_.

### Manual Installation

To manually add Redfin to your installation, create this folder structure in your /config directory:

`custom_components/redfin`.

Then drop the following files into that folder:

```yaml
translations/en.json
__init__.py
config_flow.py
const.py
hacs.json
sensor.py
manifest.json
```

## Configuration

You will need the Redfin property ID for each property you‚Äôd like to track. This information is available from the URL of a property you are interested in. If you‚Äôre the owner of this property, it‚Äôs recommended to claim the listing and update the property information to help the information be as accurate as possible.

For example, given this Redfin URL: https://www.redfin.com/DC/Washington/1745-Q-St-NW-20009/unit-3/home/9860590 the property ID is 9860590.

To enable this sensor, add new Redfin integration component in the Home Assistant UI and follow the prompts to add your properties.

The sensor provides the following attributes:

- amount
- amount_currency
- amount_formatted
- address
- full_address
- redfin_url
- street_view

Telegram) of new flats that are found on different rental websites.,"# flatcrawl-processors

This repository is part of my **flatcrawl project**. The processors will receive new flats from the message broker (ie. RabbitMQ). They will then evaluate the flats against the user defined searches and send them notifications on different channels (ie. Telegram), when they have a match.

If you are interested in how the flats end up at the message broker: there's [another repository that contains the different crawlers](https://github.com/floschnell/flatcrawl-crawlers) which will extract the flat information from the different rental portals and then sends them to the message broker's queue.

## The flatcrawl project

The purpose of the project is to **collect flats from different rental sites** and **expose them in a consistent shape**. Eventually it lets users define **custom searches** and provides them with **instant updates on new matching flats**.

**Clarification**: flats are *not* stored on the server. The purpose is not to create a competing portal, but to extend usability and help users find the right flat quickly by receiving updates from several sites without the hassle to setup and maintain different searches.

## Usage

This chapter describes how to use the flatcrawler. Only thing that you will need is the [Telegram App](https://telegram.org/) on either your smartphone, your computer or any other supported device.

### Create a Search

To create a search, you need to get in touch with the FlatCrawl bot. You can search for it and communicate with it like with any other contact in Telegram.
Use the app's search field and look for *FlatcrawlBot*. Once found, click onto it and hit the Start button to begin a conversation.

Right now the bot is capable of a few commands that you can simply type into the conversation window. To start a search, simply type `/search`. Afterwards the bot will ask you some questions and eventually keep looking for flats that match your criteria.

<p align=""center"">
<img alt=""An Example Conversation with the Flat Crawling Bot"" src=""./img/conversation.png"" />
</p>

Once the search is setup, the bot will output an numeric ID. Remember it well. The bot will not start to send flats right away! This is because you might want to be notified within a group, so that all your potential flat mates receive the offers as well. This is very helpful, because all members of the group will then be able to discuss the different flats just as they are popping in.

### Subscribe to a Search

To continuously receive new flats that match your search criteria, first go to the chat or group conversation where you would like to be notified. Then open the chat menu and add a new member. Search and choose the *FlatcrawlBot*.

Then, back in the chat, you just need to enter `/subscribe [ID]`. Of course, you will need to replace [ID] with the ID that the bot provided you with, when you finished the search setup.

That's it, now you will receive all the new flats that get posted on all the different web portals if they only match your search criteria.

## Development

This project consists of two parts:
- **Firebase Realtime Database:** Stores users and their configured searches.
- **Telegram Processor:** Client application that will listen for new events on the queue. As soon as a new flat becomes available it will check all user searches and send out messages whenever matches have been found.

Of those **only the telegram client is under source control**. However, if you setup a firebase account and create an empty database, it will then be filled automatically as soon as you run the crawling application.

### Setup
If you want to run the whole infrastructure yourself, you will need to do the following things:
1) Create a [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/) and setup an empty realtime database.
2) [Create a Telegram bot via the BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot).
3) Create a Google API Key for the Directions API
4) Create the `src/config.ts` file and fill it with the information you should have acquired from step 1, 2 and 3:
```typescript
// from step 1
export const DATABASE_KEY = '...';
export const DATABASE_URL = '...';
// from step 2
export const BOT_ID = '...';
export const BOT_TOKEN = '...:...';
// from step 3
export const GOOGLE_API_KEY = '...';
```
5) Finally - for the webhooks to work - you will also need to create a self signed SSL certificate like so:
```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout ./certs/private.key -x509 -days 365 -out ./certs/public.pem -subj ""/C=DE/ST=Bavaria/L=Munich/O=/CN=YOURDOMAIN.EXAMPLE""
```
You will need to replace YOURDOMAIN.EXAMPLE with the public domain via that the bot can be found.

### Build
Before you can build the code, you need to install all dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
After that, you can run
```
yarn build
```
which will compile all Typescript files and put them in a folder called `dist/`.

### Run
Once you have completed the setup and build steps, you can run all processors by
```
yarn start

Create `config.json` file in the root directory. When reading, this config will be merged with `config-default.json`. You can override default parameters in the created config.

Parameters:

* espocrm.repository - from what repository to fetch EspoCRM;
* espocrm.branch - what branch to fetch (`stable` is set by default); you can specify version number instead (e.g. `5.8.5`);
* database - credentials of the dev database;
* install.siteUrl - site url of the dev instance.


## Config for EspoCRM instance

You can override EspoCRM config. Create `config.php` in the root directory of the repository. This file will be applied after EspoCRM intallation (when building).

Example:

```php
<?php
return [
    'useCacheInDeveloperMode' => true,
];
```

## Building

After building, EspoCRM instance with installed extension will be available at `site` directory. You will be able to access it with credentials:

* Username: admin
* Password: 1

Note: You can build on Linux and Windows OS. Commands are the same.

### Preparation

1. You need to have *node*, *npm*, *composer* installed.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Create a database. The database name is set in the config file.

### Full EspoCRM instance building

It will download EspoCRM (from the repository specified in the config), then build and install it. Then it will install the extension.

Command:

```
node build --all
```

Note: It will remove a previously installed EspoCRM instance, but keep the database intact.

### Extension package building

Command:

```
node build --extension
```

The package will be created in `build` directory.

Note: The version number is taken from `package.json`.

## Development workflow

1. Do development in `src` dir.
2. Run `node build --copy`.
3. Test changes in EspoCRM instance at `site` dir by opening it in a browser. A URL will look like: `http://localhost/real-estate/site`, depending on how you named your directory.

## Tests

Prepare:

1. `node build --copy`
2. `cd site`
3. `grunt test`

Unit tests:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=./vendor/autoload.php tests/unit/Espo/Modules/RealEstate
```

Integration tests:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=./vendor/autoload.php tests/integration/Espo/Modules/RealEstate
```

## Versioning

The version number is stored in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

Bumping version:

```
npm version patch
npm version minor
npm version major
```

## Translation

Assuming that you have already built EspoCRM instance.

### Building PO file

1. Change dir: `cd site`
2. Run: `node po en_US --module=RealEstate` (replace `en_US` with a language code you need to translate to)

This will generate PO file in `site/build/` directory. You will need to translate this file.

### Building langauge files from PO

Assuming you have translated PO file in build directory with the same name as when it was generated.

1. Change dir: `cd site`
2. Run: `node lang en_US --module=RealEstate` (replace `en_US` with the target language code)

This will generate language files in `site/build/` directory. You will need to copy these files to `src/files/` directory and commit.

## Overview

Manifold is a plug-and-play end-to-end real estate asset tracker. In other words, it encompasses the entire process of tracking real estate listings in a variety of sources (e.g. ERA, REMAX), from website scraping to the ETL process, culminating in a Data Warehouse (Kimball). Typically, Real Estate market studies are expensive or performed by external platforms. Manifold's goal is to provide everyone with the capability to track their local Real Estate market with little effort, and virtually no expenses.

The project is built on top of different languages and platforms:
* Scrapers
  * [GoLang] - Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency making it a performant candidate for web scraping
  * [Python] (deprecated)
* ETL
  *  [Apache Airflow] - Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform
  *  [Apache Spark] - Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing
  *  [AWS EMR] - Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a tool for big data processing and analysis on Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto
  *  [AWS Redshift] - Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse product that forms part of the larger cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services
  *  [AWS S3] - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance
  


## Features

- Fast web scrapers ([GoLang Colly])
- Scalable ETL ([Apache Spark], [AWS EMR], [AWS S3], [AWS Redshift])
- Pre-built ETL DAG ([Apache Airflow])
- Backfill - only the resources for the current timestep are consumed (*default* weekly)
- Extensible
- Cheap - resources are allocated and deallocated on a need basis

## Structure

The project is divided into two main categories: web scrapers (crawlers) and ETL resources.

| Folder | Category | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| crawler | Crawlers | Go and Python (deprecated) web scrapers |
| dags | ETL | Apache Airflow DAGs |
| plugins | ETL | Apache Airflow extensions (Operators, Sensors, utilities) |
| scripts | ETL | Python and Bash scripts to be stored and executed by third parties (Apache Spark, AWS EMR) |
| images | miscellaneous | Documentation support images |


## ETL Process

The ETL process consists of five interlinked and linear steps:
1. Web scraping ([GoLang] by default)
2. Intermmediate layer - source consumption and staging preparation in Parquet format ([Apache Spark], [AWS EMR], [AWS S3])
3. Staging layer- Parquet to AWS Redshift ([AWS Redshift], [AWS S3])
4. Presentation layer - presentation layer creation with Slowly Changing Dimensions (type 2)

Note: The scrapers were not included in the DAG given different users will aim at executing them in different manners (locally, docker, Kubernetes) hence, a dummy operator replaces the scrapers by default.

![DAG](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/graph.PNG)

### Data Model

The data model is comprised of four dimensions and one fact table:

| Object Name| Object Type| SCD Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |  ------ |
| dim_asset| Dimension| SCD2 | The unique asset dimension |
| dim_broker | Dimension| SCD2 | The unique broker dimension |
| dim_geography | Dimension| SCD2 | The unique grography (country, district, county, parish) dimension|
| dim_date_view | Dimension| SCD2 | The unique date dimension (note: the object is a view which might need reparametrization) |
| fact_stock| Fact| None | Holds the stock (assets) present at a given time step |

![DAG](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/data_model.PNG)

Note: for future work, it's worth considering adding three additional fact tables:
* fact_new_stock - represents assets not present in the previous date's stock
* fact_deleted_stock - represents assets no longer present relative to the previous date's stock
* fact_price_oscillations - represents assets that suffered a price oscillation relative to the previous date's stock

### Intermmediate layer
![EMR Create](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/emr_create.png)

Launches an EMR (*default* cluster) instance, which installs the required packages using [scripts/bootstrap_install_python_modules.sh], and runs the [Apache Spark] ETL process via [scripts/el_to_parquet.py]. 

[scripts/el_to_parquet.py] in in charge of the following tasks:
- locating the S3 bucket for the referenced timestep (*default* weekly)
- consuming the identified JSON sources
- cleanup and standardization
- staging layer creation (Parquet files)
- save Parquet files to an S3 bucket

### Staging layer

The staging layer is in charge of consuming the [AWS S3] Parquet files into [AWS Redshift]. The process is handled by the S3 to Redshift Operator.

The DAG is then comprised of two steps:

1- Assert the existence of the proper schemas, and create them if not present
![Schema Create](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/staging_schema.png)
2- Copy the Parquet files into the appropriate dimensional object
![Staging Copy](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/staging_tables.png)

### Presentation layer

The presentation or consumption layer holds the final updated dimensional model. Roughly speaking, the layer's responsibilities are:
1- Calculate dimension Deltas
2- Upsert dimension data according to the computed Delta
![Presentation Dimension](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/presentation_dimensions.png)
3- Append to the fact tables
![Presentation Fact](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/presentation_facts.png)

Operations 1 and 2 are the responsibility of the [Dimension Operator], whereas the Fact appending is handled via Postgres Operator.

## Custom Operators

Two operators were introduced to facilitate and replicate Airflow functions:
- [Dimension Operator]
- [S3 to Redshift Operator]

### Dimension Operator

The [Dimension Operator] computes the Deltas between a *base_table* and *target_table*, by comparing the *(SHA256) hash* between the two tables (typically, staging vs presentation), using *match_columns* as the business keys, and updates the *target_table* by implementing a Slowly Changing Dimension of type 2.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| postgres_conn_id | str | The Airflow Redshift connection ID |
| target_table | str | The table to be updated (typically, presentation) |
| base_table | str | The base table to use as current value (typically, staging) |
| match_columns | List[str] | The list of columns representing business keys |
| database_name | str | The target database (*default dev*) |

### S3 to Redshift Operator

The [S3 to Redshift Operator] is responsible for taking a set of Parquet files stored in an [AWS S3] bucket and pushing them to the defined [AWS Redshift] cluster.


| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| redshift_conn_id | str | The Airflow Redshift connection ID |
| redshift_credentials_id | str | The Airflow connection containing the Redshift credentials |
| s3_path | str | The base [AWS S3] URL holding the Parquet files |
| s3_bucket_template | str | The template S3 Bucket template (for backfilling, *default ""/{year}/{month}/{week}/""* |
| destination_name | str | The [AWS Redshift] destination table name |
| source_name | str | The Parquet file name |
| role_name | str | The [AWS Redshift] role name |
| region_name | str | The [AWS Redshift] cluster region |

### Data Quality - Count Operator

The [Data Quality - Count Operator] implements a basic data quality layer, asserting whether or not a table contains records.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| postgres_conn_id | str | The Airflow Postgres connection ID |
| table_name | str | The Postgres/Redshift table name |

### Data Quality - Dimension Operator

The [Data Quality - Dimension Operator] is responsible for checking if a dimension contains multiple active records, in other words, if the Slowly Changing Dimension type 2 failed to process appropriately.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| postgres_conn_id | str | The Airflow Postgres connection ID |
| table_name | str | The Postgres/Redshift table name |
| identification_columns | List[str] | The unique columns (e.g. contract_number for dim_asset, broker_name for dim_broker) to serve as business keys |

## Sources

Manifold comes with two out-of-the-box scrapers: one developed in GoLang, two developed in Python (deprecated). However, given the small number of local listings per website (around 10.000), Manifold has been tested on 50 million records of weekly data, in addition to the weekly scraped listings. 

External data sources:
* [Argentina Data]
* [Colombia Data]
* [Ecuador Data]
* [Uruguay Data]
* [Peru Data]
* [Brazil Data]
* [Spain (Madrid) Data]
* [Mexico Data]

The data was then aggregated, and a 10-week weekly evolution was simulated: in each week, a sample of 80% of the dataset was retrieved, simulating new and removed assets; in addition to price fluctuations.

The final dataset contained around 50GB of data.

## Installation

Manifold is a plug-and-play project, which is fully working from the moment [Apache Airflow] is started. Nonetheless, there are configurations that need to be set and connections to be created in order to drive the DAG and make sure it's pointing in the right direction, with the appropriate permissions. 

### Configuration
#### Variables
| Variable Name | Description |
| ------ |  ------ |
| manifold_s3_path |  The [AWS S3] base bucket name |
| manifold_s3_template |  The template S3 Bucket template (for backfilling, *default ""/{year}/{month}/{week}/""* |

#### Connections
| Connection Name | Type | Description | Extra |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |   ------ |
| aws_credentials | Amazon Web Services | The AWS  ([AWS S3]) login (Access Key) and password (Secret Access Key)  | {""region_name"": ""your_region_name""} | 
| emr_credentials | Amazon Web Services | The [AWS EMR] login (Access Key) and password (Secret Access Key) | |
| redshift_conn | Postgres | The [AWS Redshift] connection details, host, schema, login, password, port | |

### Docker

Apache Spark can be started by using docker-compose on the provided image, which takes care of the entire process including the first-time setup:
```sh
cd manifold
docker-compose up -d
```

## How to Build & Deploy the API

Assumes you have:

- An AWS Account including access & secret keys
- Domain client ID & secret, available from [Domain](https://developer.domain.com.au/docs/introduction) 
- A Google maps API key
- WalkScore API key, available from [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/walk-score-apis.php)

1.  Build Domain client library

```sh
sh build_domain_client_library.sh
```

2.  Copy contents to `src`

```sh
mv domainClient/domainClient src/domainClient
```

3.  Install & configure serverless via the instructions on their [website](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)

4. Populate `serverless.yml` with all required keys


5.  To deploy:

```sh
sls deploy
```


6.  Once done, teardown the infrastructure using:

```sh
sls remove
```

## Using the API

An API will now be available that you can query with different search parameters. 

To query the API make a `POST` request using your favourite client & include a `JSON` body with your search & filter criteria. The key items to include are:

-   `Domain` [residential search](https://developer.domain.com.au/docs/latest/apis/pkg_agents_listings/references/listings_detailedresidentialsearch)
-   `Filters` are (optional) additional parameters to filter the results


Currently the supported filters are:
* `travelTime`
    - A desired destination & the maximum allowable public transport time to get there
* `features`
    - List of features the property must have:
        - AirConditioning
        - Heating
        - Outside
        - Dishwasher

# sreality

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

With the functions from this repository you can create your personal
database of property offers from the Sreality website, update their
status and analyse their history. You need some knowledge of R to do
this.

## How to use

1.  Clone this repo, or create a new project in RStudio and copy the R
    folder.
2.  Create subfolders `data` and `images`.

### Load packages and functions

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

source(""R/sreality-funcs.R"")
```

### Add property

Adds the property with the given URL to the `data/my_properties.rds`
file. If you specify the `img_dir` parameter, a small preview image is
downloaded and saved in this folder under the name *id\_property.jpg*

If a property with the given id already exists in the file, an error
will occur.

``` r
add_property(
  data_path = ""data/my_properties.rds"",
  img_dir = ""images/"",
  url = ""https://www.sreality.cz/detail/prodej/dum/rodinny/melnik-melnik-namesti-miru/3960968780""
)
#> Warning in add_property(data_path = ""data/my_properties.rds"", img_dir =
#> ""images/"", : File data/my_properties.rdsdoesn't exist. Creating a new one.
#> # A tibble: 1 √ó 8
#>   id         status checked             location  name   price description url  
#>   <chr>      <chr>  <dttm>              <chr>     <chr>  <int> <chr>       <chr>

```

Adds multiple properties to the `data/my_properties.rds` file. If any
property id already exists in the file, an error will occur.

``` r
add_property(
  data_path = ""data/my_properties.rds"",
  img_dir = ""images/"",
  url = c(
    ""https://www.sreality.cz/detail/prodej/dum/rodinny/vernerice-rychnov-/2752723036"",

```

### Update properties

Fetches all properties in the `data/my_properties.rds` file from
Sreality and appends their current data to the end of the file.

``` r
update_properties(rds_path = ""data/my_properties.rds"")
```

### List archived data

#### Full content of the archive

``` r

```

#### Current state of properties

Displays the current state of all properties in the
`data/my_properties.rds` file.

``` r
list_properies(""data/my_properties.rds"")
#> # A tibble: 3 √ó 11
#>   id         status checked_0           checked_last        dur   location name

#> # ‚Ä¶ with 4 more variables: price_0 <dbl>, price_last <dbl>, description <chr>,

```

You can filter the previous dataframe by status (only valid: `status
%in% c(""init"", ""live"")` or only removed: `status == ""gone""`), by price
change (`price_last != price_0`), etc.

#### List of properties using the {gt} package

``` r

  gt::cols_label(price_last = ""price"") |> 
  gt::fmt_number(price_last, decimals = 0, suffixing = ""K"") |> 
  gt::as_raw_html()

## To-do

Maybe I‚Äôll add those features some day:

  - Downloading preview images of the property.
  - Shiny app to make it more user-friendly.

<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
During the Wanxiang Blockchain Hackathon in Shanghai, we made a model to tokenize office space. Instead of expansive and insecure Agents selling office space we have build an smart contracts with embedded KYC and whitelist that will enable a more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have it's own ERC20 token and then each floor will have its own ERC721 to separate ownership, better control of open space and easy budget management.

## About the Project
This repository has a collection of web scraping projects. I attempted to scrape many websites in order to cope with various structures and obtain various sorts of data (cars, salary, sports...). Some of these projects feature crawling techniques as well as exploratory data visualization. I'd also like to point out that the web isn't constant, thus the method I approach a specific website scraping now may not be appropriate in the future.

I recommend starting with the notebook that scrapes movie data from <a href=''>Cineb.com</a> since it provides an understanding of how the scraping is done.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wp-api-libraries/wp-idxbroker-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wp-api-libraries/wp-idxbroker-api)

# Example Usage
The IDX Broker API library contains a method for each endpoint of the API. Visit the [PHPDocs](https://wp-api-libraries.github.io/wp-idxbroker-api/classes/IdxBrokerAPI.html) for the full documentation.

#### GET Requests
```php
$idx_api = new IdxBrokerAPI( 'example_api_key' );

$res1 = $idx_api->get_clients_featured();

$res2 = $idx_api->get_clients_systemlinks( 'url' );

$res3 = $idx_api->get_mls_approvedmls();
```

#### POST Requests
```php
$res1 = $idx_api->post_clients_dynamicwrapperurl( 'https://example.com/luxury-real-estate', '12345' );

$data = array( 'note' => 'Wheres my IDX?' );
$res2 = $idx_api->post_leads_note( '3', '1', $data );

```

#### PUT Requests
```php
$data = array( 
  'propertyName' => 'Test Property',
  'property' => array('idxID' => 'a001', 'listingID' => '345678' )
);
$res1 = $idx_api->put_leads_property( 812, $data );
```

#### DELETE Requests
```php
$res1 = $idx_api->delete_clients_supplemental( 345678 );
```

## Helper Methods

The library also provides a few methods that assist in  extracting  information that is not readily accessible.

#### Check API Key Usage
After you make a call to the API you can check your hourly API key usage using the check_usage method
```php
$usage = $idx_api->check_usage();
```

#### Get Wrapper Domain
The API doesnt have an easy way of getting the domain used on the client wrapper pages. The domain can be some version of either `<youraccount>.idxbroker.com` or `<customsubdomain>.<yourdomain>.com`
```php
$domain = $idx_api->get_idx_domain();

/*
Results
Array
(
    [scheme] => https
    [url] => search.example.com
    [full] => https://search.example.com
)
*/
```

## Extending Functionality

The IDXBrokerAPI Class is extensible, which gives developers the ability to override the functionality of the class to their needs.

For Example. Exceeding the hourly limit is a common issue developers may face when using the API. By overriding the `request()` method, we can cache the calls made to the API.
```php
class OptimizedIdxBrokerAPI extends IdxBrokerAPI {

  /**
   * By overriding the request method we can intercept the API call and choose to 
   * either make a fresh API call or retrieve a cached result from the database.
   */
  public function request( $force_refresh = false ) {
    // Only cache GET requests.
    if ( 'GET' !== $this->args['method'] ) {
      return parent::request();
    }

    // We md5 the route to create a unique key for that call and to also reduce the risk of
    // creating a key that is over 64 characters long, aka the max length for option names.
    $transient_key = 'idxbroker_cache_' . md5( $this->route );

    // Check if cached results for API call exist.
    $request = get_transient( $transient_key );

    // If nothing is found, make the request.
    if ( true === $force_refresh || false === $request ) {
      // Parent method handles the request to IDX Broker.
      $request = parent::request();

      if ( false !== $request ) {
        set_transient( $transient_key, $request, 1 * HOUR_IN_SECONDS );
      }
    }
		
    return $request;
  }
	
}
```
Now when you instantiate your new class and make calls to methods such as `get_clients_featured()` or `get_partners_clients()`, you will get cached versions of the results if they are available.

##### Usage:
```php
$optimized_idx_api = new OptimizedIdxBrokerAPI( 'yourapikey' );

$results = $optimized_idx_api->get_clients_featured(); // Fresh call to the API.

$results = $optimized_idx_api->get_clients_featured(); // Cached results.
```

## About Galt Project

Galt Project is an international decentralized land and real estate property registry governed by DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization) and self-governance protocol for communities of homeowners built on top of Ethereum blockchain. Unlike the state property registries, the Galt Project is managed by a decentralized community of property owners using smart contracts. Creation of property records, resolution of disputes between owners, trading, mortgage, title insurance, and many other operations are performed on smart contracts. Also, property owners can unite in communities for voting, fundraising, and managing the common property.

### Galt Project Tokens
GALT - ERC20 standart ethereum based token.

SPACE - ERC721 standart ethereum based token.

arthur-e,parcel-analysis,,https://github.com/arthur-e/parcel-analysis,https://api.github.com/repos/parcel-analysis/arthur-e,"Tools for cleaning, managing parcel-level real estate data","Contains scripts for working with fixed-width real estate data, including deed sales, tax assessor's records, and foreclosure records, as commonly purchased from vendors such as Data Quick, RealtyTrac, and Attom Data Solutions.
Specifically includes support for:

- Conversion from fixed width to delimited (e.g., CSV) format;
- Creation of a relational database table (PostgreSQL) from a layout file;
- Inflation adjustment of home sales and other dollar amounts (from CPI-U for housing, 1982-2015);
- SQL scripts for some analysis, geocoding of transactions, assessments, and foreclosures;

Much of the scripts assume a couple of working objectives because they were developed as part of an applied research project.
I have no intention of changing these any time soon but will consider any pull requests that improve/ generalize this work.
If you're working in a different study area, the intent is that this repo is, at the least, a great place to get inspired/ up-to-speed on using these data.
By subfolder:

- `DataQuick/` - Assumes working in Los Angeles MSA
- `RealtyTrac/` - Assumes working in Detroit-Flint-Ann Arbor CSA

**Disclaimer: No actual real estate data are included in this repository as this would violate data license agreements.**

Dependencies
============

GNU Awk (overrides `awk` but is also called `gawk`) is required for this but it may not be installed already.
On Debian systems (including the Ubuntu distributions) it is likely not available; try:

```sh
sudo apt-get install gawk
```

`dos2unix` may also be required if you are using a non-Windows computer. I discovered Windows-style line endings in the CoreLogic data, for instance.

Workflow
========

To import some foreclosure data into a database, we want to perform the following steps, in order:

1. Save the data dictionary/ layout file as a CSV and edit as necessary. **You must make sure that the header is in the first row and there are no extra rows (every row is a field description).**
2. **If necessary,** clean the RealtyTrac data dictionary (`clean_data_dict.py`).
3. Create the database to hold our foreclosure records.
4. Convert the fixed-width files to comma-separated variable (CSV) files to be read.
5. Copy data to the table.

Create the Database and Schema
------------------------------

Create a database `realtytrac` owned by `arthur`:

```sh
$ . create_db.sh realtytrac arthur
```

Then, create the `transactions` (Recorder) table, where `sr_unique_id` is the primary key.

```sh
$ python create_from_data_dict.py ""transactions"" data_dict.csv ""sr_unique_id"" | sudo -u postgres psql -d $DBNAME -f -
```

Convert Fixed-Width Files to CSV
--------------------------------

The length column is always the fourth column, so leave the index at ""4"" as in the following example.
Where the field length column is at index 4 and we want to use the "">"" character as a delimiter:

```sh
$ . convert_fixed_width_to_csv.sh data_dict.csv 4 "">"" fixed_width_data.txt > output.csv
```

Because the fixed-width data contain so many different characters, I found it necessary to use the following delimiters with each data file:

* Recorder data: The right angle-bracket "">"" character
* Assessor data: The vertical bar ""|"" character
* Foreclosure data: The vertical bar ""|"" character

Copy Data to Database Table
---------------------------

For example, copying data to the `transactions` (Recorder) table:

```sh
DBNAME=detroit
TABLE_NAME=transactions
sudo -u postgres psql -d $DBNAME -c ""COPY $TABLE_NAME FROM 'test.csv' WITH DELIMITER '>' NULL AS ''""
```

Data Issues
===========

DataQuick
---------

One significant issue with the DataQuick exports is that they have backslashes; these often occur right before the text delimiter.

**The layout file for the Tax Assessor data** (""Tax_Layout_w_Property_Level_lat_long_w_code_01262017.xlsx"") **has a few problems:**

- It's not clear what the primary key should be. `map_reference_1` is described as ""A CoreLogic unique key to link record to the CoreLogic CD Map product"" but the field is empty for some rows.
- It specifies a `centroid_code` field that does not exist in the data. This field should NOT be created in the database or all the columns after this column index will be shifted one to the right.
- It does NOT specify the `owner_full_name` field, which is clearly evident in the data. This field should be added to the layout file and a column created in the database.
- The `assessed_year` column is supposed to be a 4-digit year (""YYYY"" format or, e.g., ""2016""); however, it contains strings like ""20160000""--that is, with 4 trailing zeros. This needs to be fixed in the layout file and the database column for `assessed_year` needs to allow 8 digits.
- The columns `front_footage`, `depth_footage`, `living_square_feet`, `ground_floor_square_feet`, `basement_square_feet`, `garage_parking_square_feet`, `total_baths`, and `sale_price` are all described as integer columns in the layout file but they all contain decimal numbers.
- The columns `OWNER_1_LAST_NAME`, `OWNER_1_FIRST_NAME_MI`, `OWNER_2_LAST_NAME`, `OWNER_2_FIRST_NAME_MI`, `SUBDIVISION_NAME` may be too short. At least the first one, which has a specified width of 30 characters, exceeded that limit on Line 16. I defined all these columns to have 255-byte lengths (the maximum for `varchar` type).
- Columns `mail_unit_number` and `zoning` also have incorrect widths. I upgraded these to 255 characters after running into too many edge cases (e.g., ""313MAILBOX"").

(By the way, most of these issues were discovered on Line 1 of the file! They are not rare!)

**The layout file for the Deed data** (""Deed_Layout_PropertyLevel_Lat_Long_11172016.xlsx"") **has a few problems:**

- The fields `pcl_id_iris_frmtd`, `situs_carrier_code`, `deed_sec_cat_codes_2x10`, `mtg_sec_cat_codes_1x10`, `mailing_carrier_code`, 'transaction_type', `mailing_house_number` are listed as integer fields but contain character data.

RealtyTrac
----------

In the metadata/ layout files provided there were some elements that simply weren't true (or couldn't be true):

* In the Assessor layout file, after converting it to a CSV, I changed the ""Empty Value"" field for the `process_id` field from ""No"" to ""Yes"" because, in fact, there are NULL values in the `process_id` field within the Assessor data.
* The `sr_unique_id` field is **not** unique in the Assessor data and therefore cannot be used as a primary key.
* In the Foreclosure layout file, after converting it to a CSV, I changed the ""Empty Value"" field for multiple fields from ""No"" to ""Yes"" because, in fact, there are NULL values in the `trustee_unit_nbr` and `fd_beneficiary_unit_nbr` and `parcel_nbr_raw` fields.

In the Tax Assessor's data:

* `sa_parcel_nbr_change_yr` (""Indicates the year in which the most recent parcel conversion took place.""); this ranges wildly from 2001 to 2015 with over 1.2 million properties assigned a year of 0. Some years, like 2004, have 6 properties while others, like 2008, have over 490,000.
* `sa_yr_blt` (""Year in which the primary structure was built on the property"")
* `sa_yr_blt_effect` (""Year in which 'permitted' major improvements were made to the property"")
* `sa_condition_code` (""Code indicating the state/condition of a particular property""); unfortunately, it is blank for every record.
* `sa_architecture_code` (""Indicates the architectural style of the structure.""); it is blank (equal to ""0"") for almost 98% of the records.
* `sa_construction_code` (""Indicates the material used in the construction of the framework for the structure on the  property.""); blank for about 96% of the records.
* `sa_patio_porch_code` (""Indicates the presence or type of patio or porch.""); non-null for every record, but there is no code for ""not present"" so it's unclear what to make of this.
* `sa_pool_code` (""Indicates if there is a pool on the property and/or pool construction material.""); blank for about 98% of the records, **which should indicate the property does not have a pool.**

**Primary Keys:** It's not clear what RealtyTrac intended, but here are some possible primary keys (unique for every record):

    Assessor data:
        sa_property_id (""Unique primary key identifier assigned to a property"")

    Foreclosure data:
        unique_id_notice (""Unique transactional identifier for a recorded pre-Forecelosure Notice."")

    Recorder data:
        sr_property_id (""Joined to Assessor data to merge Assessor and Recorder data. Internal identification number assigned to every property"") -- NOT UNIQUE
        sr_unique_id (""Unique  ID assigned to the original loan transaction for an Assignment record."")

**Useful Fields:**

- In the Assessor file, the `use_code_std` field is populated for most of the records and describes the type of property. Those codes beginning with an ""R"" are residential properties; ""RSFR"" properties are single-family home properties.

Here's an example of field coverage for select fields from the Detroit Metropolitan Statistical Area:

| Dataset  | Field Name          | Coverage
|----------|---------------------|-----------------
| Recorder | sr_deed_type        |  96.5%
| Recorder | sr_doc_type         |  96.0%
| Recorder | sr_tran_type        | 100.0%
| Recorder | sr_arms_length_flag |  21.1%

==========================================

Python based AWS Lambda function for checking the Zillow Zestimate of a 
given property value.

When triggered, this function pulls a CSV from a configured S3 location 
and the current Zillow Zestimate (including rental estimates) for a 
specified property. If the date of the last update to the Zestimate is 
newer than the last date in the file, a message is published to an 
SNS topic with the new value and the full Zestimate response is 
appended to the CSV.

Zestimates API documentation: https://bridgedataoutput.com/docs/explorer/zestimates#listZestimates

Expected Environment Variables
------------------------------

+ zaddress - Address to track
+ zwsid - Bridge Interactive API Server Token (for server-to-server communication)
+ bucket_name - S3 bucket name to store Zestimate history
+ bucket_key - S3 object name to store Zestimate history
+ sns_topic_arn - SNS topic to publish to when new updates available

Deployment
----------

Continuous Deployment is done via the GitHub Actions workflow. Alternatively, 
the included [Makefile](./Makefile) will build a ZIP file which can be 
deployed to AWS Lambda. This ZIP file will include all dependencies 
(including Pandas, and therefore rather large).

A [Dutch study](https://www.politieacademie.nl/kennisenonderzoek/kennis/mediatheek/PDF/86218.pdf) that largely served as inspiration for this project found the three best indicators to identify conspicuous properties in the Netherlands are foreign ownership, the owner being a just-established company, and unusual price fluctuations. Therefore, my model having `just_established_owner` as the most important feature matches their study exactly.

Also encouraging is my model having year-over-year price differences for two years as some of the most important features. This roughly aligns with their third indicator of unusual price fluctuations.

Next, `out_of_state_owner` roughly maps to foreign ownership in the Dutch case.

Lastly, `owner_own_multiple` fits the general typology of money laundering in real estate where someone would own more than one property to launder larger amounts of money.


## About:

Money-laundering in residential real estate has become a significant focus of the United States Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) over the past few years. As a part of this focus, FinCEN has begun releasing Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) that make title insurance companies legally obligated to report a real estate transaction if it meets specific criteria. These GTOs are applied at the county level, including such counties as Miami-Dade, Dallas, and Los Angeles. One county covered by a GTO that has always interested me is Bexar County, Texas, the county that surrounds San Antonio. Under a GTO since July 2016, Bexar County and San Antonio have a long history of ties to northern Mexico, with weekend commutes between San Antonio and Monterrey commonplace. The county has also recently had several high-profile instances of Mexican politicians stashing ill-gotten gains in real estate around San Antonio.

Therefore, focusing on Bexar County, I used publicly available data from the county property assessor and the state of Texas to build a model capable of detecting criminal investment in residential real estate in the county. This repository visualizes the data and applies unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches to detecting criminal investment.

## Contents:

- **data**:
  - raw_h5_files/bexar_property_all.h5 - 2019 Bexar County Appraisal District data with appraisal values from 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 added.
  - raw_h5_files/texas_corp_merged.h5 - State of Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts company data merged with the Comptroller's dataset that includes company directors and officers.
  - labels/criminal_properties_labels.csv - Dataset of properties located in Bexar County that have been used to launder the proceeds of some form of crime.

    One such example is 1115 Links Cv, San Antonio, TX 78260, which is owned by Red Kaizen Investments LLC. Red Kaizen Investments LLC is one of dozens of companies named as defendants in the court case against Rafael Olvera Amezcua, a Mexican financier accused of running a sham savings and loans business that defrauded depositors of more than $160 million.
  - figures - HTML output of plotted addresses of labeled properties from folium.
  <p align=""center"">
    <img src=""./data/figures/crim_prop_map.png"" width=""500"" title=""Map of criminal properties"">
  </p>


- **build**:
  - build/merge.py - Script that joins the relevant columns from the Comptroller dataset with the cleaned Bexar property data. The output is a preprocessed h5 file.
  - build/process.py - Script that generates features for modeling and joins the labeled properties data. The output is a processed h5 file.
  - build/get_true_labels.py - Script that reduces the dataset to properties that I can confidently label as either ""innocent"" or ""criminal"" (see above for the ""criminal"" label). Output is h5 file.

      In order to build an adequately-large (several thousand) set of ""innocent"" properties, I assumed that every property owned by one of the top-30 most frequent owners would be innocent. I felt comfortable making that assumption because most of these owners are home builder companies and government agencies. There is, however, an obvious skew that this subset will have - newer properties as well as atypical housing that the county or city of San Antonio may own.

- **modeling_scripts**:
  - clustering.py - Script that visualizes clusters in the property data.
  - isolation_forest.py - Script that applies the Isolation Forest anomaly detection
algorithm to the property data and then returns visualizations and
model performance metrics.
  - semisupervised_pseudolabeling.py - Script that uses pseudo-labeling to train a semisupervised Gradient Boosting model. Outputs model metrics and confusion matrix visualization.

- **notebooks**:
  - Bexar_EDA.ipynb - Notebook for visual inspection of the data.
  - clustering.ipynb - Notebook that applies several unsupervised learning techniques to the data to reveal clusters.
  - isolation_forest.ipynb - Notebook that applies the Isolation Forest anomaly detection algorithm to the property data. I also used my experience in the field to trim the dataset to what I believed to be the most important features and applied the algorithm to this subset.
  - semisupervised_pseudolabeling.ipynb - Because I have a limited dataset of properties with labels I can be truly confident in, I used pseudo-labeling to train a Gradient Boosting Classifier.


- **configs**:
  - config.yaml - Contains variables for .py scripts

## Setup

1. Clone repository.
2. Go to <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16hbhfiExi2Nf6zO56Dzl_28kw2cKKsB0?usp=sharing"" target=""_blank"">this Google Drive link</a> to download the raw datasets for both Bexar Property and the Texas Comptroller.
3. Select ""Download All"" in the upper righthand corner. This will download a zip file.
4. Unzip the zip file and move the resulting ""raw_h5_files"" folder to this repo under the data folder. The two files will, together, be ~750 MB in size.
5. Install pipenv (if not already installed) and create a new environment with the requisite packages:
```
brew install pipenv
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```
6. Merge the two raw datasets into a preprocessed file:
```
python build/merge.py
```
7. Build the features used for modeling:
```
python build/process.py
```
8. Create dataset with true labels:
```
python build/get_true_labels.py
```

## Build Model


```
python modeling_scripts/clustering.py
python modeling_scripts/isolation_forest.py
python modeling_scripts/semisupervised_pseudolabeling.py
```

## Future Directions

- Train a GAN model for better semisupervised learning.
- Visualize with Streamlit.
- Add more features, such as Zillow neighborhood ratings, that have proven useful in other similar exercises.

ombharatiya,property-advisor,,https://github.com/ombharatiya/property-advisor,https://api.github.com/repos/property-advisor/ombharatiya,Django app for a property advisor & matching service. Uses linear proportion conversion algorithm to match the properties and give suggestions to buy properties/real-estate based on your budget.,"# Property Advisor
(by [@ombharatiya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ombharatiya))

- - -

### A demo app for a property advisor application using match feature:

**Check the deployed app here : [Property Advisor](https://property-advisor.herokuapp.com/).**

- - -
#### Problem Statement:

Agentdesks has a lot of properties from property sellers and searches requirements from property buyers which get added to a SQL database every day. Every day these multiple properties and search criteria get added through our application by agents. Write an algorithm to match these properties and search criteria as they come in based on 4 parameters such that each match has a  match percentage.

##### The 4 parameters are:

- Distance - radius (high weightage)
- Budget (high weightage)
- Number of bedrooms (low weightage)
- Number of bathrooms (Low weightage)
- Each match should have a percentage that indicates the quality of the match. Ex: if a property exactly matches a buyers search requirement for all 4 constraints mentioned above, it‚Äôs a 100% match.  
- Each property has these 6 attributes - Id, Latitude, Longitude, Price, Number of bedrooms, Number of bathrooms
- Each requirement has these 9 attributes - Id, Latitude, Longitude, Min Budget, Max budget, Min Bedrooms required, Max bedroom reqd, Min bathroom reqd, Max bathroom reqd.

#### Functional requirements:

1. All matches above 40% can only be considered useful.
2. The code should scale up to a million properties and requirements in the system.
3. Requirements can be without a min or a max for the budget, bedroom and a bathroom but either min or max would be surely present.
4. For a property and requirement to be considered a valid match, distance should be within 10 miles, the budget is +/- 25%, bedroom and bathroom should be +/- 2.
5. If the distance is within 2 miles, distance contribution for the match percentage is fully 30%
6. If the budget is within min and max budget, budget contribution for the match percentage is full 30%. If min or max is not given, +/- 10% budget is a full 30% match.
7. If bedroom and bathroom fall between min and max, each will contribute full 20%. If min or max is not given, match percentage varies according to the value.
8. The algorithm should be reasonably fast and should be quick in responding with matches for the users once they upload their property or requirement.

#### Assumptions made:

- Since it is not mentioned that the valid budget +/- 25% has to be taken from min/max budget value, I assumed the average value to calculate the +/- 25% and the added both sides.
- Assuming all the data will be provided
- Created 1000 properties mock data in database to match with the requirements.
  - assumed bedrooms & bathrooms between 1 to 6
  - assumed price between $ 1k to 10k
- Using [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to calculate distance between two points in miles
   


#### Algorithm used:

I used linear proportion conversion algorithm to generate results.
Here's the formula for it:
```
OldRange = (OldMax - OldMin)  
NewRange = (NewMax - NewMin)  
NewValue = (((OldValue - OldMin) * NewRange) / OldRange) + NewMin
```

Here's the steps for one data: 
(example of price - budget matching):
- given min & max budget and price of a property
- calculate the average budget 
- define boundaries for valid to 100% matching condition
- using above expression to find the matching percentage
- returning data

#### Request Object Model:

#### Calculations:

After indivisually calculating matching of every field, I'm then merging them according to the provided weightage:

```
DISTANCE_WEIGHT = 0.3
BUDGET_WEIGHT = 0.3
BATHROOM_WEIGHT = 0.2
BEDROOM_WEIGHT = 0.2

Result(in %age)  = distance_match * DISTANCE_WEIGHT
        + budget_match * BUDGET_WEIGHT
        + bedroom_match * BEDROOM_WEIGHT
        + bathroom_match * BATHROOM_WEIGHT

```

### Abstract:

The following work has the aim to build a robust Scraping API service to
extract Real Estate rental data (Milan, IT) and applying *geostatistics*
spatial modeling through a convenient computing alternative called INLA.
Data originates from immobiliare.it database and it is extracted through
a *scraper* built on top of the website. The scraper is *optimized* with
respect to both the server side *kindly requesting* permission and
imposing *delayed-request rates*, and the client side by granting
continuity through *fail dealers* and request‚Äôs *headers rotation*.
Scraping functions exploit a custom workflow that combines url reverse
engineering and optimal search strategies within the website. Speed
comes from the fact that differently from spiders and derivatives which
operate a full crawling down of the web site, the workflow concentrates
only on a restricted set of urls. A further critical speed boost is
offered by parallelism through the latest *Future* back-end, and a run
time benchmark demonstrates the scraper rapidity for two recent parallel
with two configurations. The scraper is then wrapped into a http API
through an R framework, namely *Plumber*. Security is a major focus and
anti dossing strategies, HTTPS and sanitization are singularly treated.
Docker can offer a lightweight environment where dependencies are
conveniently organized making the software portable. As a result the
whole API service is *containerized* and built upon custom Dockerfiles,
which are orchestrated by *Compose* through a .yml file. Amazon EC2 is
an AWS web service providing a stable, scalable cloud computing
capability in which the system is hosted. The service choice is a free
tier one. Along with the server it comes the need of a reverse proxy
service and the choice falls on *NGINX* reverse proxy server for
authentication and load balancing. The architecture principles stacked
on top of the http API elevates it to being RESTful. RESTful APIs are a
mean of communication among internet services that allows to perform any
kind of action without having both parts to know how they are
implemented. In other words, if the client wants to interact with a web
service with the aim to retrieve information or perform a function, a
RESTful API land a hand by communicating the *desiderata* to that system
so it can understand and fulfill the request in a secured and structured
way. Software CI/CD is managed through automatic workflow that exploits
GitHub and DockerHub, which ultimately allows containers to be pulled
into the EC2. Once the RESTful API endpoint is invoked, data, in this
case Milan rental market within the municipality borders, is
asynchronously scraped and collected into a JSON format. Traditional
spatial bayesian methods have been generally slow in the context of
spatial big data since covariance matrices are dense and their
inversions scale to a cubic order. Therefore Integrated Nested Laplace
approximation (INLA) is applied constituting a faster computational
alternative on a special type of models called Latent Gaussian models
(LGM). *INLA* shorten computations through analytics approximations with
Laplace and numerical methods for space matrices with the aim to obtain
an approximated posterior distribution of the parameters. Hedonic Price
Models (HPM) constitutes the economic theoretical foundation of the
model according to which the linear predictor is set. As a matter of
fact house prices are related to the value of the property by their
demand-offer price equilibra for each single characteristic (including
the spatial ones). A further aspects addresses the fact that prices are
considered as a proxy value for rents since they are both
interchangeable economic actions satisfying the same need. However the
critical part of studying house characteristics in geostatistics is the
*estimation* for the reason already anticipates. LGMs are defined into a
hierarchical bayesian modeling framework, distinguishing three nested
hierarchy levels: the likelihood of the data (generally an exponential
family), the latent Gaussian Markov Random Field GRMF (where the linear
predictor is) and the hyper parameter distribution for which priors are
specified. GMRF are suitable since they provide a sparse precision
matrix due to conditional assumption, marking matrices tridiagonal. The
spatial component of the data is considered as a discrete realization of
an underlying unobserved and continuous Gaussian Process (GP) to be
estimated, completely characterized by a mean structure and a covariance
matrix. For the Gaussian Process are made two major assumptions:
stationarity and isotropy, which let specifying a flexible covariance
function i.e.¬†Mat√©rn. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equations
(SPDE) solutions can provide a GMRF representation of the GP whose
covariance matrix is Mat√©rn. This happens through a triangulation of the
domain of the study, i.e.¬†mesh. The model is then fitted and cross
validated with R-INLA and inference on parameter posterior distribution
is given.

### Deployment:

The deployment of the project is made through Netlify + GitHub + GitHub
actions (CI environement).

# Spark

## Introduction

An augmented reality based property valuation further enhanced by blockchain and data science to provide an end-to-end mortgage application processing platform‚ú®üì±

## Motivation

Mortgage industry has been around for a long time but has not improved the processing times for end to end mortgage application processing. This is due to the archaic technology and processes still followed by the parties involved in the mortgage food-chain. Currently it takes on an average of 40+ days from submitting home loan application to closing the loan or settlement of funds. <br>
<br>
Given the advancement in Augmented Reality technology, it is imperative for this very pen and paper process to catch up with the emerging technologies. Blockchain mortgages has a potential to disrupt the existing processes and could eliminate costs and inefficiencies thus improving closing time line and saving a lot of fees that are currently charged in each step of application processing. <br>
<br>
Combining Augmented Reality, Data Science and Blockchain, Spark aims to provide a new end-to-end mortgage application processing which ensures efficient, effective and timely reslution of application in a transparent manner.

## Dependencies

- Xcode 10.1
- ARKit 2
  - Swift 4.2.1
  - OpenCV 3.4.2
  - R.swift 4.0.0

* Ethereum
  - Ganache CLI (Choice of Ethereum Client) (EthereumJS)
  - Solidity 0.5.1
  - Truffle Framework
 * Keras
  - Tensorflow

## Technology

The end-to-end solution is made possible by Swift and React Native which allows us to make a mobile application and a web application for the mortgage applicants and the banks respectively. In order to ensure that the powerful tehcnologies being used in the backend are only used to serve the user and not scare them, we are expecting to neatly package the entire backend suit into a final iOS application which handles all the necessary key views provided to the user. <br>
<br>
Let's delve into the three key technologies which power Spark.

```

## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### Setup dependencies

```diff
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

- provider = ""postgresql""
+ provider = ""mysql""

# Configure environment variables.
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Prisma schema to our database
pnpm db-push
```

### Configure Expo `dev`-script

> **Note:** If you want to use a physical phone with Expo Go, just run `pnpm dev` and scan the QR-code.

#### Use iOS Simulator

1. Make sure you have XCode and XCommand Line Tools installed [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/).
2. Change the `dev` script at `apps/mobile/package.json` to open the iOS simulator.

```diff
+  ""dev"": ""expo start --ios"",
```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

#### For Android

1. Install Android Studio tools [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).
2. Change the `dev` script at `apps/mobile/package.json` to open the Android emulator.

```diff
+  ""dev"": ""expo start --android"",
```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

## Deployment

### Next.js

#### Prerequisites

_We're gonna be using PlanetScale (cloud hosted & managed mysql database) with Prisma which isn't quite ready yet._

#### Deploy to Vercel

Let's deploy the Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). If you have ever deployed a Turborepo app there, the steps are quite straightforward. You can also read the [official Turborepo guide](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/turborepo) on deploying to Vercel.

1. Create a new project on Vercel, select the `apps/web` folder as the root directory and apply the following build settings:

<img width=""927"" alt=""Vercel deployment settings"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11340449/201974887-b6403a32-5570-4ce6-b146-c486c0dbd244.png"">

> The install command filters out the expo package and saves a few second (and cache size) of dependency installation. The build command makes us build the application using Turbo.

2. Add your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

3. Done! Your app should successfully deploy. Assign your domain and use that instead of `localhost` for the `url` in the Expo app so that your Expo app can communicate with your backend when you are not in development.

### Expo

Deploying your Expo application works slightly differently compared to Next.js on the web. Instead of ""deploying"" your app online, you need to submit production builds of your app to the app stores, like [Apple App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps). You can read the full [Distributing your app](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/), including best practices, in the Expo docs.

1. Let's start by setting up [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/), which is short for Expo Application Services. The build service helps you create builds of your app, without requiring a full native development setup. The commands below are a summary of [Creating your first build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/).

   ```bash
   // Install the EAS CLI
   $ pnpm add -g eas-cli

   // Log in with your Expo account
   $ eas login

   // Configure your Expo app
   $ cd apps/mobile
   $ eas build:configure
   ```

2. After the initial setup, you can create your first build. You can build for Android and iOS platforms and use different [**eas.json** build profiles](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/eas-json/) to create production builds or development, or test builds. Let's make a production build for iOS.

   ```
   $ eas build --platform ios --profile production
   ```

   > If you don't specify the `--profile` flag, EAS uses the `production` profile by default.

3. Now that you have your first production build, you can submit this to the stores. [EAS Submit](https://docs.expo.dev/submit/introduction/) can help you send the build to the stores.

   ```
   $ eas submit --platform ios --latest
   ```

   > You can also combine build and submit in a single command, using `eas build ... --auto-submit`.

4. Before you can get your app in the hands of your users, you'll have to provide additional information to the app stores. This includes screenshots, app information, privacy policies, etc. _While still in preview_, [EAS Metadata](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/metadata/) can help you with most of this information.

5. Once everything is approved, your users can finally enjoy your app. Let's say you spotted a small typo; you'll have to create a new build, submit it to the stores, and wait for approval before you can resolve this issue. In these cases, you can use EAS Update to quickly send a small bugfix to your users without going through this long process. Let's start by setting up EAS Update.

   The steps below summarize the [Getting started with EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/getting-started/#configure-your-project) guide.

   ```bash
   // Add the `expo-updates` library to your Expo app
   $ cd apps/mobile
   $ pnpm expo install expo-updates

   // Configure EAS Update
   $ eas update:configure
   ```

6. Before we can send out updates to your app, you have to create a new build and submit it to the app stores. For every change that includes native APIs, you have to rebuild the app and submit the update to the app stores. See steps 2 and 3.

7. Now that everything is ready for updates, let's create a new update for `production` builds. With the `--auto` flag, EAS Update uses your current git branch name and commit message for this update. See [How EAS Update works](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/how-eas-update-works/#publishing-an-update) for more information.

   ```bash
   $ cd apps/mobile
   $ eas update --auto
   ```

   > Your OTA (Over The Air) updates must always follow the app store's rules. You can't change your app's primary functionality without getting app store approval. But this is a fast way to update your app for minor changes and bug fixes.

8. Done! Now that you have created your production build, submitted it to the stores, and installed EAS Update, you are ready for anything!

<h2>üëã Introduction</h2>

The Jakarta Housing Prices Project aims to provide detailed insights into the housing market in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. By collecting and analyzing data from [Rumah123](https://www.rumah123.com/), a popular real estate website, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of price trends, property features, and other relevant factors. This analysis is intended to benefit potential home buyers, real estate professionals, and researchers interested in the Jakarta housing market.

<p align=""right"">(<a href=""#readme-top"">back to top</a>)</p>

<h2>üö∂ Walkthrough</h2>

This section provides a step-by-step explanation of the process used to create this project:

<h3>üåê Data Source</h3>

We source our data from [Rumah123](https://www.rumah123.com/), a prominent online platform in Indonesia known for its extensive property listings. This website provides detailed information about various properties, including their prices, locations, sizes, and additional features.

<h3>üîÑ Data Scraping & Data Cleaning</h3>

We employ Python along with the Selenium library for web scraping. Selenium allows us to automate the process of extracting housing price data. With carefully crafted scripts, we retrieve the desired information, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Following the scraping process, we apply data cleaning techniques to refine and format the collected data, making it suitable for analysis.

<h3>üíæ Data Storing</h3>

We utilize Google BigQuery, a fully managed and scalable cloud-based data warehouse, for storing the cleaned housing price data. BigQuery offers efficient storage and retrieval capabilities, enabling us to handle large datasets with ease. By leveraging the power of BigQuery, we can perform seamless data analysis and generate valuable insights.

<h3>üìä Data Visualization</h3>

To facilitate the exploration and presentation of our findings, we create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. It provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of visualization options, allowing us to visualize housing price trends, average and median prices per district and city, and other relevant metrics. The dashboard offers an intuitive way to interact with the data, empowering users to gain valuable insights at a glance.

<h3>üìÉ Data Overview</h3

In addition to the interactive dashboard, we provide the housing price data in a spreadsheet format. This allows users to access and analyze the data in a more detailed and customized manner. The spreadsheet format offers flexibility for further calculations, filtering, and exploratory analysis, catering to users who prefer working with raw data or conducting their own analyses.

<h3>ü§ñ Automated Process</h3>

The entire data analysis pipeline is automated using GitHub Actions. Every day at 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, and 2 AM UTC+7, GitHub Actions automatically triggers the data scraping, cleaning, storing, and visualization processes. This ensures that the data and insights are up-to-date and readily available for users without manual intervention.

<p align=""right"">(<a href=""#readme-top"">back to top</a>)</p>

<h2>üìö Conclusion</h2>

The Jakarta Housing Prices Project offers comprehensive insights into the housing market in Jakarta, supporting informed decision-making for various stakeholders. The interactive dashboard, created with Streamlit, provides a visually engaging and user-friendly interface for exploring housing price trends and patterns. Additionally, the availability of the data in a spreadsheet format ensures flexibility and customization for deeper analysis.

</p>

This repo containts my entry for Imperial create lab's [summerdatachallenge](http://summerdatachallenge.com). The challenge was to apply data science techniques to one or more of their supplied datasets. I chose **London house prices**, listings for all house sales within 100 km of the City of London from 2009 up to 2014.

A short written report can be found under [`report/sdc_report.pdf`](report/sdc_report.pdf) and there's an accompanying site at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea).

## How to run

Clone the github repository or download as a zip archive then run as described below. Note that the competition data is **not** included in this repository due to its terms of use, so to run these analyses you must first place the file `Houseprice_2009_100km_London.csv` (137 MB) in directory `houseprices/`. Scripts are all in the `R` directory, so can then be run with e.g. `Rscript R/fractal_context.R`, but are best played with interactively through an R IDE such as [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

The main scripts are briefly described here, more information is available in source code comments:

* `fractal_context.R` generates a series of visualisations (namely `plots/FC*`) that relate a specific area to its neighbouring sector, district and area in terms of, is it the most or least expensive in a given locale? An outlier? Unexpectedly underpriced? Figures FC0-4 were combined for the final report using inkscape.
* `arima_model.R` ‚Äî after some background work, fits AR|I|MA models to house price time series and plots the forecast of a given sector ([`plots/forecast.pdf`](plots/forecast.pdf)) as well as a random selection for comparison ([`plots/grid_forecasts.svg`](plots/grid_forecasts.svg)).
* `investment_grade.R` ‚Äî fits ARIMA models to all sectors in dataset (2500+?) and calculates historical volatility to be combined into an investment grade. Saves the top 5 sectors ([`plots/top5_investments.svg`](plots/top5_investments.svg)) and a summary dataframe R object ([`rds/invest_grade.rds`](rds/invest_grade.rds)).

Other more minor scripts include:
* `postcode_map.R` ‚Äî draws a series of monthly png bitmap images then stitches them together into animated gifs (via ImageMagick commandline) to show the entire dataset of house sales over time.
* `interactive.R` ‚Äî builds the basic javascript plots using rCharts (and dimple.js) of investment grading used online.
* `report_viz.R`‚Äî just draws the introductory overview map ([`plots/report_overview.pdf`](plots/report_overview.pdf))for the written report.
* `gmap.R` ‚Äî outputs a csv ([`gmap/fusion_kml.csv`](gmap/fusion_kml.csv)) for use with fusion tables and the Google Maps API in order to build the interactive map overlay shown in the online report.

The directory `wip/` contains work in progress scripts or analyses that didn't make the final report. `writeup/` contains a version of the online report (current version at: [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea)) and `report/` contains the LaTeX written report.

## sessionInfo()

Below is the output of `sessionInfo()` which shows loaded package versions, the OS and R version (3.1.1) under which these scripts were written. For CRAN snapshots, these analyses were performed around mid October 2014.

### Average Housing Units/Year
![av_housing_units_per_year](/Pics/av_housing_units_per_year.png?raw=true)

### Average Price/Neighborhood (with Interactive Dropdown Selector for Neighborhood)
First, group by year and neighborhood and then create a new dataframe of the mean values:

    mean_values = sfo_data.groupby([sfo_data.index, ""neighborhood""]).mean()
    mean_values.reset_index(inplace=True)
    
Then use HVPlot to create an interactive line chart of the Average Price/Sq. Foot, with a dropdown selector for the neighborhood:

    mean_values.hvplot.line(x=""year"", y=""sale_price_sqr_foot"", xlabel= ""Year"", ylabel=""Average Price/Square Foot"", groupby=""neighborhood"")

The above code results in the following interactive line chart:

### Average Value/Neighborhood utilizing MapBox API
First, calculate the mean values for each neighborhood:

    mean_neighborhoods = sfo_data.groupby(""neighborhood"").mean()
    mean_neighborhoods = mean_neighborhoods.reset_index()
    
Then join average values with the neighborhood locations (Lat/Long loaded in with MapBox API):
    
    values_and_locations_df = pd.concat([df_neighborhood_locations, mean_neighborhoods['sale_price_sqr_foot'], mean_neighborhoods['housing_units'], mean_neighborhoods['gross_rent']], axis=1).dropna()

Lastly, create a scatter plot through mapbox to analyze neighborhood info:

    map_plot = px.scatter_mapbox(values_and_locations_df, lat=""Lat"", lon=""Lon"", size=""sale_price_sqr_foot"", color=""gross_rent"", color_continuous_scale=px.colors.cyclical.IceFire, size_max=15, zoom=3, width=1000, hover_name=""Neighborhood"", title=""Average Price/Square Foot and Gross Rent in San Francisco"")

### [Presentation Slide Deck](https://github.com/lexiddie/d-fastighet-blockchain/blob/main/Slide%20Deck.pdf)

## What is dFastighet?

**dFastighet** is the application for real estate organizations to conduct transactions as Smart Contract using blockchain technology via **Hyperledger Fabric**. Moreover, dFastighet came from the word '**decentralized real estate**' in the **Swedish** Language.

When it comes to real estate transactions, it takes months and significantly slow processes. And it requires third parties or the middlemen like **brokers, banks, and lawyers**. Moreover, it will not eliminate the local government regulations as the guarantors. The real estate transactions will be on the smart contract executed into the Blockchain network with blockchain technology. As a result, it removes **bureaucracy, middlemen, and complete transparency**.

The transactions of the real estate will be able to speed up. **Smart-contract** makes it convenient to bind the digital ownership of the **property**, **documents**, and **contracts** swiftly into the blockchain network. The owner will be protected because their data are inside the blockchain network, and it is impossible to be **tampered** with or **altered**.

## [What is Hyperledger Fabric?](https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/what-is-hyperledger-fabric/)

Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source, permissioned blockchain framework, started in 2015 by The Linux Foundation. It is a modular, general-purpose framework that offers unique identity management and access control features, making it suitable for various industrial applications such as track-and-trace of supply chains, trade finance, loyalty and rewards, and clearing and settlement of financial assets.

[Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) is intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture. Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play. Its modular and versatile design satisfies a broad range of industry use cases. It offers a unique approach to consensus that enables performance at scale while preserving privacy.

## Benefits of Hyperledger Fabric

1. Open Source
2. Permissioned blockchain
3. Governance and Access Control
4. Performance

## Blockchain

The Blockchain is a digitally decentralized ledger, as we so-called data. Its primary technology provides a decentralized network without the trusted third party, secured using cryptography, and regulated under the consensus algorithm.

Blockchain is an immutable and irreversible chain. Moreover, most blockchains are distributed to their chains of the network, which fully peers to peers. Again, those networks are computers that do the computational equation as they are called nodes.

Blockchain provides an independent, tamperproof, transparent new platform to store, transmit securely, and process sensitive and valuable data.

Blockchain is only consisting of a list of validated blocks. Moreover, each block is connecting to its predecessor to the genesis block.

## Private Blockchain | Permissioned Blockchain

Private Blockchain is an innovation-only single organization network to have access and authority over the network. It is a partially decentralized system.

- Redux
- JavaScript
- ExpressJS
- Google Cloud Platform
- Firebase

# Data:
Fannie Mae Single-Family Acquisition and Performance data.
Files are released quarterly but contain monthly information. Each of the quarterly files (Acquisition and Performance) contains information on loans that originated in that quarter and all history to the most recent quarter.
Fannie Mae is the nickname of FNMA, the Federal National Mortgage Association. Fannie Mae was established in 1938 by congress as part of the New Deal to stimulate the housing market by making mortgage more attainable for low- and middle-income families. Fannie Mae does not originate loans, but it does back or guarantee them.

# Goal:
The goal of this project is to use Fannie Mae‚Äôs mortgage performance data to make predictions about a given customer. We want to forecast 1. the probability a borrower will go into default in the next quarter, 2. the probability a borrower will not pay their next mortgage payment, 3. how long until a borrower goes into default, and 4. how these trends vary geographically.

	Proposed Methods:
	
	1. The probability a borrower will go into default in the next quarter.
		a. Logistic regression on default indicator
		b. Other ML techniques
		c. Automate selecting best model‚Äîdisplay optimal model, graphics relevant to chosen model
		d. Chose state to build state level model
	
	2. The probability a borrower will not pay their next mortgage payment.
		a. Logistic regression on missed payment indicator
		b. Other ML techniques
		c. Automate selecting best model‚Äîdisplay optimal model, graphics relevant to chosen model
		d. State level
	
	3. How long until a borrower goes into default.
		a. Hazard model
		b. State level
	
	4. Forecast Visualization: Enter your info and get probability of default and time to default.
	
	5. Map Visualization: How these trends vary geographically.
	
	
# Inspiration:
The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) guarantees mortgages to stimulate lenders to assume the risk of extending a mortgage to a qualified borrower.  In order to qualify for a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae, borrowers must meet certain criteria that are strong indicators of their ability to pay the loan.  Despite choosing borrowers that meet criteria, sometimes, borrowers are not able to make regular payments on their loan and might even go into default. Lenders know there will be some loss involved in mortgage lending.  If the lender can predict how much loss they might incur, they can employ methods to hedge their losses.  

In this project we seek to provide a tool that will help a lender to determine if an individual account will default given certain origination information and current age.   

 
 # Analysis:  
The focus of this analysis is to develop a loan level model that predicts whether a borrower will default (miss 4 or more payments) on their mortgage based on origination nand performance information available through Fannie Mae.  

Model fitting began with logistic regression on a random sample of Fannie Mae data.  The resulting model had an accuracy score off 99.8%, which seems too good to be true.  When you look at the precision of both outcomes: default or not default.  There was not a single prediction of defaulting.  Thus, not defaulting was predicted with 100% accuracy, and defaulting was predicted with 0% accuracy.  This averaged out to a score of 99.8 because the number of defaults present in the data is very small.

In order to make predictions about defaulting, more observations of default are needed.  Because the model assumes independence among the observations and is not trying to make predictions about the population, but instead a single account, the proportion of loans that defaulted are sampled at a higher rate than loans that do not default.  

Running logistic regression using LogisticRegressionCV with the oversampled data provided better results.  While the accuracy number was still high, 91%, the precision of default was improved, though not ideal at 61%. 

A decision tree was fitted to the oversampled data set.  In order to see any significant splits that identified delinquency, the depth had to be set at at least 5.  At this depth, the tree is very complex, with 32 nodes, with only 5 of those nodes identifying default.

A random forest model was fitted using XGBoost provided a very accurate prediction of both defaulting and not defaulting (0 and 100%, respectively).

All fitted models seem to be most influenced by the age of a loan. As a loan ages, it's likelihood of defaulting increases.  This might be because once a borrower begins to miss payments, it becomes increasingly hard as time passes to right their account. As the borrower gets further away from the date they qualified for their loan, there is more opportunity for their credit score, or debt to income to change, thus providing more possibility for default as time passes.

 
# Conclusion:
Though several modeling techniques were investigated, the best models to provide a prediction of default were logistic regression and Random Forest using XGBoost.  Both models are used to provide a user with a prediction of default given information enter for an individual loan.


# What‚Äôs next for analysis?:   
![Canueza](images/futuredevelopment.jpg)

This initial analysis of the Fannie Mae data uses two modeling techniques to answer one question, whether a borrower will default.  There are more opportunities for analysis and prediction using this data.  There are also other methods and modifications to the existing analysis that might improve the prediction of default.

There are more modeling techniques that might provide better prediction of a borrower defaulting.    A Bayesian forecast technique could be implemented assuming a distribution on the current loan delinquency status from the previous month to predict whether a borrower will default. 
A RandomizedSearchCV method of random forest optimization is thought to yield more robust solutions than the XGBoost method that was used here.  It would be of interest to compare the accuracy of different random forest modeling methods.

_Data Enhancements_
This study focuses on a narrow timeline to draw conclusions about defaulting early in the life of a mortgage.  Defaulting is possible at any stage of a loan‚Äôs lifetime.  Including data over a broader timeline would create a more robust model could predict default in more mature mortgages.  
To better capture the regional differences in the economic wellbeing in the country, including an MSA level Case Shiller Index would provide another variable that likely has a high correlation with defaulting trends.

_Additional Questions the Data Can Answer_
While this study focuses on defaulting (missing 4 or more payments), an early look at delinquency could also be useful.  The likelihood of missing a payment given the current loan delinquency status could be modeled using a Bayesian Logistic Regression, where the current delinquency status has an assumed distribution.
Another outcome of interest is whether a loan will be prepaid.  It would be interesting to look at factors that are predictive of whether a borrower will prepay their loan.
Another way to look at the data is to consider how long it takes for a customer to default or miss a payment.  Estimating the time until default could be accomplished using a hazard survival model where defaulting is the event of interest and loans that do not default in the observed time period are considered censored. Considering 3 possible ways for a mortgage to end, payment until maturity, default, and prepay, a competing risk hazard model could predict the time until any event that might result in the loan not reaching maturity.

# Data Management / Cleaning / Flask Coding

1. The Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Data was downloaded as CSV files from Fannie Mae website.

2. In the master dataset, we ensured referential integrity and brought the data to 3rd normal form. Referential integrity states that table relationships must always be consistent. In other words, any foreign key field must agree with the primary key that is referenced by the foreign key. Third normal form (3NF) is a normal form that is used in normalizing a database design to reduce the duplication of data and ensure referential integrity.

3. The data was cleaned using Python Pandas. We started by concatenating all years into a single Acquisition file and then filtering by Single Family, Principal Residence and Purchase Only, which helped us narrow the scope of this project. 
Afterwards, we selected the loans from the Performance data, based on the loan identifier from the cleaned Acquisition table. Due to the size of the files it was necessary to break down the selection and cleaning process first by quarter and then concatenating the files by year.
Finally, to start the machine learning process we took an oversample due to the low percentage of loans with delinquency.


4. AWS RDS ( Amazon Web Services ) was chosen as our cost effective data warehouse based on the amount of data that we would need to run through our machine learning models. The free tier Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 (HVM) was selected based on the default image which includes AWS command line tools, Python, Ruby, Perl, and Java. The repositories include Docker, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other packages.

![Canueza](images/001-aws-postgres-001.jpg)

5. Postgres PGAdmin was used to create the SQL tables, ACQ, PER ( Sample Data ), PEREXT ( full data )
6. Postgres PGAdmin was used to import the TXT files into the created SQL tables. This was done during the proof of concept phase. It would be easily configured to populate Postgres on AWS RDS directly from Pandas.



# Python Flask coding: 
Created the framework of the app.py, template/index.html, static/js/app.js files to connect to the ProgresSQL database and create a hello world template to build on.  


# Leaflet Loans Originated Map
	1. Leaflet 1.3.3, a JS library
	2. GeoJSON file was created based off of the Fannie Mae Dataset.
	3. Geometry obtained from https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/nidis/geojson/us/base/unitedstates.geojson
	4. MapBox map layer is populated by 54 features. Each feature having 8 properties 
	   and geometry multi-polygon coordinates.

This repository contains codes for the porfolio analysis of a real estate company. <br>
All information below is fictional.

#### Project 001 - Real Estate Insights
The objetives of this project are:
* Perform exploratory data analysis on properties available on dataset.
* Determine which properties should be purchased according to business criteria.
* Develop an online [dashboard](https://p001-realestate-insights.herokuapp.com/) that can be acessed by the CEO from a mobile or computer.
<br>

## 1. Business Problem
House Rocket business model consists of purchasing and reselling properties through a digital platform. The data scientist is in charge to develop a online dashboard so that the company's CEO can have an overview of properties available to became part of House Rocket portfolio in King County (USA).<br>

The [dashboard](https://p001-realestate-insights.herokuapp.com/) must contain:
   * Which properties the company should buy.
   * A map view with properties available.
   * A table view with attributes filters.
   * Expected profit of each property.<br><br>


**_Dashboard screenshot exemple:_**

## 2. Business Results
There are 21,436 available properties. Based on business criteria, 10,707 should be bought by House Rocket resulting on a US$1,2B profit.<br>
Maximum Value Invested: US$4,163,721,410.00<br>
Maximum Value Returned: US$5,412,837,833.00<br>
Maximum Expected Profit: US$1,249,116,423.00<br>

This results on a 30.0 % gross revenue.
<br><br>

## 3. Business Assumptions
* The data available is only from May 2014 to May 2015.
* Properties with bedrooms disproportional with interior living squarefoot were deleted, assuming it was a input error.
* Seasons of the year:<br>
   * Spring starts on March 21st<br>
   * Summer starts on June 21st<br>
   * Fall starts on September 23rd<br>
   * Winter starts on December 21st<br>
* Business criteria to determine whether a property should be bought are:
   * Property must have a 'condition' equals or bigger than 3.
   * Property price must be below or equal the median price on the region (zipcode)

Property is a client-side web application for aggregating open data about properties in the City of Philadelphia. All logic is in client-side JavaScript -- there is not server-side components outside of the open data APIs.

Property makes several AJAX calls, some of which are required to complete before the next one can happen. The flow happens like this:

1. Geocode user input expecting zero or more property results. These results include a summary of OPA and standardized address data.
2. With the OPA number, fetch the OPA details for a single property.
3. At the same time, use the Standardized Address to fetch the service area data from Socrata.

But a user can also share a link directly to a property which contains the OPA number in the query string. In this case, the flow happens like this:

1. With the OPA number, fetch the OPA details for a single property.
2. After the details have been fetched, then use the Standardize address to fetch the service area data from Socrata.

## Local Setup

Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:CityOfPhiladelphia/property2.git
cd property2
```

Start a web server of your choosing. For example:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

For python v3 users:
```
python3 -m http.server 9000
```

You're done! Go visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

## Contributing

### Markup

Nearly all markup is in templates located in `index.html`, but note that some is generated in the JavaScript views.

### Application

All application setup logic is in `js/app.js`. This includes event bindings, templating, utilities, etc.

### Views

`js/front.js`
- for the landing page.

`js/results.js`
- for displaying zero or more than 1 results as a table.

`js/property.js`
- for showing all of the details for a single property.

## Deploying

Property is hosted on GitHub pages. To deploy:

1. Push a new feature branch to GitHub.
2. Create a Pull Request from your feature branch to the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Merge the Pull Request.
4. Open the cloudfront page under the PHL-OIT account and invalidate the cache so the changes will be reflected in the site.
5. Done!

## Supported Browsers

Test against each of these browsers, including mobile and print view, before deploying to production.

- IE9 and up
- Latest version of all other browsers

James-E-Adams,auction-results,,https://github.com/James-E-Adams/auction-results,https://api.github.com/repos/auction-results/James-E-Adams,realestate.com.au auction results csv generator,"# REA Auction Results CSV Generator

- Having a quick browse on https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/vic, there is no easy way to see a sorted-by-price list of sold properties from that weeks auction results. All the info is available in REA's not-so-public API (i.e if you watch HTTP traffic in the dev tools when you click to an auction-results page).

This is just a quick script to grab that data and generate a CSV that allows you to browse all the auction results for the last week, sorted however you want. I've only grabbed the data I'm interested in, but you can easily alter the map to include any extra info.

You could run this each week once the auction results are posted and browse by price.

## Usage

```
git clone git@github.com:James-E-Adams/auction-results.git
cd auction-results
yarn
yarn do
```

You'll get a `results.csv` and a `results.json`.

Then you can open the CSV in google sheets and sort however you like.

## Notes:

- I've set the delay between calls to 100ms to avoid getting throttled. Seems to be fine. I haven't actually been throttled but from experience it's pretty easy for this to happen.
- The script just does it for VIC but could easily be modified to do other states/all states if you generate the suburbs list (instructions in `src/index.js`).

## Overview

The Deed Protocol is a comprehensive, open-source blockchain framework built on Ethereum, allowing users to register, lease, and sell real-world assets such as properties, vehicles, and commercial equipment. Using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) via ERC721 and ERC1155 standards, these assets are represented digitally as DeedNFTs. This groundbreaking protocol offers a blend of seamless digital transactions with rigorous legal compliance.

## Features

- **Universal Property Registration**: The Deed Protocol simplifies registration of any real-world asset, be it properties, vehicles, or commercial equipment. Every registered asset is represented by a unique DeedNFT, which legally signifies the ownership of the asset.

- **Efficient Leasing and Sales**: By leveraging blockchain technology, The Deed Protocol provides a secure, transparent and efficient platform for leasing and selling properties. It meticulously handles every transaction, including deposits, rent payments, and transfer of ownership.

- **Legal Compliance**: Ensuring utmost legality, each DeedNFT under The Deed Protocol represents a bona fide agreement between the involved parties. All transactions are further fortified with traditional off-chain agreements.

- **Interoperability**: DeedNFTs promote an inclusive ecosystem where they can be freely traded. Additionally, they are compatible with any platform that supports ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens.

- **Decentralized Governance**: The Deed Protocol is governed by a community-oriented Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), where decisions are made collectively.

## Architecture

- **Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts**: The Deed Protocol employs blockchain-based smart contracts for transactions, including registration, leasing, and sales of properties, ensuring transparency and immutability.

- **Legal Framework**: The Deed Protocol integrates a legal framework comprising traditional off-chain agreements that supplement on-chain transactions, ensuring legal binding and compliance.

- **Royalties and Fees**: The Deed Protocol incorporates a robust system for managing transfer fees and royalties, securing a portion of all secondary sales for the original property registrant or the platform itself.

## Installation

As an Ethereum-based protocol, interacting with The Deed Protocol requires a compatible Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask.

1. **Install MetaMask**: Install the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html) extension on your browser.
2. **Connect to Ethereum Network**: Configure MetaMask to connect to the desired Ethereum network where The Deed Protocol is deployed.

## Usage

- **Interact with DeedNFTs**: Once you have MetaMask set up and connected, you can interact with DeedNFTs. Whether you're registering a new property or trading an existing one, all you need is to submit transactions through MetaMask following the instructions provided by The Deed Protocol interface.

- **For Developers**: Developers interested in contributing to The Deed Protocol can clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and start exploring. Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and Truffle installed and correctly set up.

fgrillo89,real-estate-scraper,,https://github.com/fgrillo89/real-estate-scraper,https://api.github.com/repos/real-estate-scraper/fgrillo89,"A library for scraping real estate websites built on asyncio, aiohttp, and Beautiful Soup ","# real-estate-scraper

Welcome to the Real Estate Scraper library! This library provides a simple and flexible way to extract real estate listings from a specified website. With just a few lines of code, you can customize a scraper for a specific website and start collecting data on properties in your desired location.

The library offers two modes of scraping: shallow and deep. Shallow scraping retrieves basic information on listings directly from the search results page of the website, such as the price, address, living area, and number of rooms. Deep scraping, on the other hand, retrieves the individual webpages dedicated to specific listings and extracts all the details from those pages, including the energy label, status, year of construction, and full description of the listings.

The Scraper class is the main interface for scraping data. It allows users to specify the necessary configurations for a specific website and provides functionality to limit the number of active requests and requests per second, as well as parse and save the scraped data. The library also includes utility functions for timing function execution and logging.

To use the library, you'll need to create a ScraperConfig object with the necessary configurations for the website you want to scrape. The ConfigObject class is a base class for objects representing configuration data, and the Item class represents a single item with a name and type. The WebsiteConfig class stores the settings for a specific website, such as its name, main URL, and a URL template for searching listings in a specific city. The NamedHouseItems class is a dictionary-like class for storing and accessing named items, which is used to store the items to be scraped from the website. Finally, the ScraperConfig class combines all of these components to store the configurations for a specific scraper.

For the time being, the library already provides a fully configured scraper for the Dutch and Italian real-estate markets. To use it, you can import the get_funda_scraper function from the funda_scraper.py module. This module includes all the necessary configurations and functions to scrape the listings from the website funda. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from real_estate_scraper.countries.netherlands.funda_scraper import get_funda_scraper

# create an instance of the Scraper class tailored to www.funda.nl
scraper = get_funda_scraper()

""""""
scrape 'deep' the first 3 results pages for the city of Rotterdam, 
and store the results in a DataFrame. Because there are 15 listings per results page, 
this will scrape 45 websites

df = scraper.download_to_dataframe(city='Rotterdam', pages=[1, 2, 3], deep=True)

pH-7,Free-Text-Search,,https://github.com/pH-7/Free-Text-Search,https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Text-Search/pH-7,This full-text search allows users to search real estate properties (present in Daft.ie) by just speaking or typing what their want. The engine will then parse and translate the words and return the correct data.,"# Simple Free Text Property Search


## Description

Free Text Search Engine for the Irish Estate Properties using the [Daft.ie API](http://api.daft.ie).

The Engine translates what the user are looking for and transforms the input string into a string requests and then will send that request to the Daft.ie API.

The script also offers the voice speech recognition thanks HTML5 & JavaScript speech-input.


In this script, I use:

* PSR0 to PSR4 coding standards
* Formatted/documented code
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
* OOP code (including PHP Interfaces & Traits (PHP 5.4 specification)
* *spl_autoload_register* (which is very useful with PHP namespaces)
* View/Controller pattern
* Singleton pattern (even if not necessary...)
* PHP alternative syntax for the template (which makes the visibility easier)
* Class member access on instantiation (PHP >= 5.4)
* Short Array syntax (PHP >= 5.4)
* Using SOAPClient


## Search Query Examples

* 2 or 3 bed to rent between 1000 and 2000
* 3 bedrooms to buy in Dublin
* 2 or 3 beds apartment to rent in Cork around 400 and 600 euro
* 4 bedroom house to let in Galway for 1000 around 900 and 14000 per month


## Specification

* Search Type (Rental/Sale)
* Price (Min-Max)
* Bedroom (Min-Max)
* Property Types (house, apartment, site)
* House Types (terraced, semi-detached, detached, end-of-terrace, townhouse)
* Retrieve Areas from the API
* Retrieve Counties from the API
* Each search term has its own Class and is getting back by the ""Parser"" class and included by *spl_autoload_register()* SPL function
* HTML5 **speech-input** search
* Displayed the property results thanks to Daft's API


## Other Coding Convention

In addition of using the **PSR** and **PHP Pear**, I use my own for the naming of the variables

Here are the variable prefixes:
* a = Array
* i = Integer
* f = Float, Double
* b = Boolean
* s = String
* o = Object
* m = Mixed
* r = Resource
* c = 1 Character (I used only sometime that, as char is not a PHP valid type)

Following the ""*letter type* lower case, the variable name is in UpperCamelCase (e.g., $a**MyVariable**)


## Server Requirements of the Web App

*Application Server* PHP 5.4.0 or higher.

*PHP Extension* SOAPClient


## Other Requirements

* A Valid [Daft API Key](https://github.com/pH-7/Free-Text-Search/blob/master/Engine/Config.php#L20)

NilsOle,valuespots,,https://github.com/NilsOle/valuespots,https://api.github.com/repos/valuespots/NilsOle,Interactive map for spatial distance scores,"# Amsterdam value spots

With this app, you can easily find out where in Amsterdam the true valueable spots for housing are. 

Try the app:
[https://www.nilsole.net/valuespotter_app/index.html](https://www.nilsole.net/valuespotter_app/index.html)

![](screenshot.png)

## Distance scores

This works by measuring the distance between each building and certain value marks, such as the closest Starbucks store or the closest access to the motorway.

These ""distance scores"" tell you exactly which streets and buildings match your needs.

## Create your custom score

You can also combine your custom needs and create your individual score. By calculating the weighted mean distance for a multitude of value marks, the app will help you find your perfect spot to live.

## Data sources

[NL Extract](https://data.nlextract.nl/bag/csv/): The locations of houses and addresses were taken from this dataset (as of November 8, 2017).

## Future to-do's

* Include the code for generating the initial distance variables (such as Starbucks distance and NS IC train station distance).

* Add more data for the heatmap (currently limited to Amsterdam city).

* Increase app performance when using a high raster resolution.

* Make the UX more intuitive (particularly the creation of the custom score).

* Improve documentation.

This project is a web application that helps users determine if their rent is too high compared to similar properties in their area. The app uses data from New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) Tenancy Services and Addressfinder API to look up residential addresses.

## Methodology

This web application conducts a comparison of a user's rent to the general rent levels in their area to determine whether their rent is higher than typical. Here is how it's achieved from a statistical perspective:

1. User inputs their current rent, the number of bedrooms, and their property address. The system identifies the property from its database using the input address.

2. A request is sent to the server with the user's information. The server then fetches comparable rental data for similar properties (same number of bedrooms) in the same geographical area. 

3. This comparable data is analyzed, and three primary statistics are calculated: 
    - The **upper quartile** (75th percentile), which is the value below which 75% of the data falls.
    - The **median** (50th percentile), which is the middle value of the data.
    - The **lower quartile** (25th percentile), which is the value below which 25% of the data falls.

4. For each of these statistics, a comparison is made between the user's rent and the calculated values. This is done by simply subtracting the user's rent from each of these values. This results in three differentials, one each for the upper quartile, median, and lower quartile. If the differentials are positive, this indicates the user's rent is below the corresponding value. If they're negative, the user's rent is above that value.

5. Another statistic calculated is the interquartile range above the upper quartile (IQR above UQ), which is the degree to which the user's rent exceeds the 75th percentile. An IQR above UQ of 1.5 or greater is considered significantly high and triggers a warning message suggesting the rent may be unusually high.

This way, users can compare their own rent to that of similar properties in the same area and understand whether they're paying an average, below average, or above-average rent. It's worth noting that the higher the user's rent is above the median and quartiles, the more they are paying compared to other renters in the area.

## Features

- Address autocomplete using Addressfinder API
- Rent comparison based on Tenancy Services data
- Visual presentation of the user's rent compared to the upper quartile, median, and lower quartile of similar properties in the area
- Display a message if the user's rent is significantly higher than the median rent, informing them that the Tenancy Tribunal might consider an application for rent adjustment

<p align='center'><img src='images/houses.jpg' alt='houses'/></p>
The valuation of residential properties can take a huge chunk of time. Machine learning models can be used in production to assist real estate agents in swiftly estimating house values based on several house properties. On the consumer side, it promotes transparency by allowing home buyers to view current and historical property details.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to forecast house values in Washington based on the characteristics of these properties.

## About The Data
- The Data contains 4600 entries and 16 columns including the house prices
- There are 3 non-numerical columns and 13 numerical columns
- There are no missing values in the data
- The average house price in the dataset is 551,963
- The least price in the dataset is $0 while the most expensive house costs 26,590,000
- The oldest house was built in year 1900 while the newest house was built in 2014

## Data Preprocessing
The data was split into train and test sets (in the ratio 3 to 1) before passing the train set through the following proprocessing stages:
- Outliers Removal: two extreme values were removed
- Feature Extraction and Engineering: new features were created from existing features (e.g the **quadrant** and **road_type** columns were created from the **street** feature
- Feature Scaling: Skewed features were normalized while  wide-range features were simply scaled
- Category Encoding: Some categorical features were dummy encoded while ordinal categories were used directly
The whole preprocessing steps were bundled into a single pipeline

## Model Training and Evaluation
Linear and Tree-based models were trained on the preprocessed data. The gradient boosting algorithms produced encouraging results, with CatBoostRegressor outperforming the others on unseen data with an error of around 93,000. Most of the models suffered from overfitting.

## Conclusion
**Size, location, condition, and amenities** are some of the most important considerations for home purchasers when determining which property to buy.
<p align='center'><img src='images/top_features.png' alt='top_features'/></p>

## Next Steps
- The models could benefit from hyperparameters tuning
- Wrapping everything in docker to make the work reproducible
- Productionizing the final model

The main goal of this project is to identify areas in Queens with the highest real-estate investment potentials using time series forecasting.

## Structure

- `SCRIPT` a folder containing all scripts with functions used in notebooks
- `PNG` a folder containing all images used on this REAME

## Data
Data was sourced from [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). Our data contains location information along with the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI, $) for time series as old as 1996. (According to Zillow, ZHVI is ""A smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value (35th - 65th percentile range) and market changes across a given region and housing type."") Generally, the ZHVI is referred to as 'housing price' or 'average housing price' throughout this repo.

I capped the time periods to be since September 2003 because that's when all zipcodes in Queens started to provide data. Our final dataset had 203 monthly home values for each zipcode in Queens (September 2003 ~ August 2020). The last 40 months were used as a test set.

In order to compared the the growth trend across areas with different housing values, I used the percent increase of housing price at each time point instead of the actual housing price. 

![all_percent_increase.png](PNG/all_percent_increase.png)  
**Percent Increase (All Zipcodes)**

Out of 54 zipcodes in Queens, I selected 4 zipcodes that deviates the most from the overall average, and 1 zipcode that is closest to the overall average to represent the majority. The select zip-codes are '11101', '11693', '11692', '11694', '11103'. 

## EDA

![all_housing_price.png](PNG/all_housing_price.png)  
**Housing Price (All Zipcodes)**

We can see that the housing prices in Queens are generally following similar upward trend with a very few exceptions.  
Average percent increase is about 0.3%, average ranging from -1.85% to 2.09% depending on the zipcodes. Overall the minimum value is -2.76% and the maximum value is 3.12%.


![average price increase](PNG/avg_percent_increase.png)  
**Average Percent Increase**

This plot shows the average price increase (%) across all Queens. We can see that there was a price bubble early 2000s, then the prices started to drop during 2007-2008 recession. Since then it's been steadily growing at around 0.5% each month, until the recent COVID-19 outbreaks. 


![total_percent_increase](PNG/total_percent_increase.png)  
**Total Percent Increase**

This map shows overall the areas closer to Manhattan (e.g. LIC) have shown the higher total percent increase.


![price_growth_10_yrs.png](PNG/price_growth_10_yrs.png)  
**Price Growth in the Past 10 Years**

The fixed price growth in zipcodes bordering other boroughs reflect the recent developments in these areas.


## Model Evaluation
Our data overall showed a strong yearly seasonality. Some zipcodes had non-stationary data. All zipcodes showed tailing off ACF and PACF, so I decided to use SARIMA. Additionall, I looked at the Facebook Prophet and the stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning neural network. For the baseline model, I used the historic average and the persistence algorithm, which predicts the last observed value to be the following value. 

Here are some example predictions from these models (for 11101, LIC)...

SARIMA model had the least amount of RMSE, which was an improvement from the baseline model. (Average percent increase per month per zipcode is about 0.3%)

## Forecasting
Finally, I used the SARIMA model to forecast the percent increase of housing prices in these five zipcodes.

![forecast_percent_increase](PNG/forecast_percent_increase.png)

Our model is forecasting that the price for 11693 (Rockaway Beach) will likely to continue to stay increasing even though the rate of price increase might not stay as high as it currently is. On the other hand, the prices for 11103 (Astoria) and 11101 (LIC) are at a bit of plateau right now, but will start to increase going forward. Given how Astoria had the trend closest to the overall Queens, these two neighborhoods will likely to follow similar growth pattern as the overall Queens. On the other hand, the forecast shows that prices for areas right around the Rockaway Beach (11694 and 11692) but not the central rockaway beach will likely to drop for a while.

![forecast_housing_price](PNG/forecast_housing_price.png)

We can see that popular areas with already high housing price like LIC and Astoria are likely continue to go up at a similar rate so worth investing into if the budget is high. On the other hand, the rockaway beach area is a growing neighborhood with lower average housing price that will likely to do well in the future. But other rockaway areas that are not around the central rockaway beach is forecasted to decrease.

danielacraciun,scrape-rec,,https://github.com/danielacraciun/scrape-rec,https://api.github.com/repos/scrape-rec/danielacraciun,Real estate data gathering and notification,"## Quick get started guide:
1. Create your Python virtualenv
2. Run this:
```
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRESS_PASSWORD=<pass> -e POSTGRES_DB=ads -p 5345:5432 -d postgres
```
3. (Optional) Get a Telegram Bot token & add it to `.env`
4. Complete the `.env` as needed. Run `export $(cat .env)`
5. Run your scraper with: `scrapy crawl <scraper_name>

## Quick note:
This makes use of a notification bot, through the `SpiderBotCallback`, you can disable it in the settings if you want no bot interaction (just data gathering).

# Deployment:
Remember to set database and bot specific variables as environment variable before starting! Open .env file and complete it, then run `source .env`

Database:
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD
- POSTGRES_HOST (if needed)
- POSTGRES_PORT (if needed)

Bot:
- BOT_USER_SETTINGS_FILE
- BOT_TOKEN


#### Zero to hero steps:
1. Install the following:
    * git
    * docker
    * run-one (optional)
2. Clone the repository
3. Build the scraper docker image
4. Create pgdata and httpcache docker volumes

Run scrapers manually:
1. Install:
    * pip
    * virtualenvwrapper
2. Create python3 virtualenvironment
3. Install requirements.txt

## Docker

### Create volumes:
    docker volume create pgdata
    docker volume create httpcache

### Build the docker image:
    # Build the image for all scrapers
    docker build -t scraper .
    
    # Build the image for running individual scrapers
    docker build -f Dockerfile-single-spider -t single_scraper .

### To run postgres only (on other port but same volume):

Please see the docker_env.list file and set the following:
    
    POSTGRES_USER=postgres
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pass>
    POSTGRES_DB=realestate            // database name
    PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data   // postgres docker volume mount point

Then, you can use this command to start the postgres instance with the path to the env file:

    docker run --env-file ""<path/to/docker_env.list>""  -p <exposed port>:5432 -d postgres

### To run scrapers only (make sure you have postgres and httpcache volume up first):
    docker run --network=host -v httpcache:/var/lib/httpcache/ scraper

### Restoring psql backups
    cat <dump_name>.sql | docker exec -i <docker-postgres-container> psql -U postgres -W -d realestate
    
### To rescrape all urls from httpcache (you need to edit the spider name in Dockerfile-only-httpcache first):
    docker build -t scraper_only_httpcache . -f Dockerfile-only-httpcache
    docker run --network=host -v httpcache:/var/lib/httpcache/ scraper_only_httpcache


## Crontab    

### Make sure the current user is in the docker group, add it if needed:
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

### Make sure you have run-one installed, this is used to ensure that only one instance of the scraper is running at any given time
    sudo apt-get install run-one

### Optional: If you have the virtualenv created you can run the python script
    python setup_crontab.py

### This is the crontab command, set this in a user's crontab (the user must be in the docker group):
    To run all scrapers you need only this line:
    * * * * * run-one docker run --network=host -v httpcache:/var/lib/httpcache/ scraper
    To run individual scrapers you'll need one of these for each scraper:
    * * * * * run-one docker run --network=host -v httpcache:/var/lib/httpcache/ -e spider_name=<spider name> single_scraper

    Don't forget the backup script!
    * * * * * run-one /path/to/backup.sh

mdcnuydt,data-science,,https://github.com/mdcnuydt/data-science,https://api.github.com/repos/data-science/mdcnuydt,Data science tools for real estate. Python focused.,"# Intro

I am a big believer in the potential of modern data science techniques to improve real estate investment analysis. Quantitative analysis is already being used by the biggest hedge funds and investment banks and I believe that, as more and more data becomes available, the biggest asset class in the world is ready to benefit from these same techniques. 

Sound judgement and expert financial modelling will always remain important (for that you can check [my other repo](https://github.com/mdcnuydt/financial-modelling)). However, more data driven assumptions are crucial to enhance that analysis.

This repo contains some datasets I've played around in my free time and are solely intended for personal use. A big thanks to the guys at [Property Quants](https://propertyquants.com) who's course taught me many of these techniques and provided some of the datasets. If you are interested in this kind of stuff make sure to check them out!

# Notebooks

Currently there are only a few notebooks online. More will follow once I've cleaned up the code a bit. Datasets can be found in the datasets folder.

- **avm_singapore.ipynb**: Compares ML techniques for building an automated valuation model for real estate in Singapore.
- **cl_countries**: Compares REIT performance of countries and clusters them in groups.
- **cl_london (WIP)**: Compares London house prices with UK macro economic indicators and clusters the time-periods.
- **cl_singapore (WIP)**: Builds on avm_singapore notebook. Investigates if we can improve our AVM by first clustering the data and building an AVM for each cluster.
- **ts_south_africa**: Makes forecasts based on time-series data from the South African housing market.

# 1. A few of python manage.py commands: notes here for memory purpose

## Migrate the changes to databse
(1) `python manage.py makemigrations` -> Migrate the models to the `migrations` folder
(2)`python manage.py migrate` -> Migrate the changes to database
 (Whenever we change the models `models.py`, we need to run both)
 
## Show the sql query used to create tables
 `python manage.py sqlmigrate listings 0001`
 
## How to update the static files?

Firstly add/edit the static files in the core app `realestate` then run  `python manage.py collectstatic` to migrate the changes to the core statics folder!

## start a new app
(1) `python manage.py startapp <app-name>`
(2) add the new app to the core app settings.py under the `INSTALLED_APPS`

- Python 3++
- MySQL 

### Modules
- Scrapy
- geopy
- MySQLdb
- hashlib
- folium
- geopandas

## Getting Started
In the currently version, use the realEstateSpider.py to start the scraping process. Just pass a town for the scraping process, to collect informations from aparments in jena or berlin. 

 ```
 python3 realEstateSpider.py <town>
 ```
 ## Software-Description
 ### realEstateSpider
 The real-estate-monitor is a software, developed with the scraping framework scrapy. It was developed as a part of a scientific work, to create an automated markt overview for real estates in any town or location. The information would be scraped from the real estate markets  
    - [wg-gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de)\
    - [immobilienscout24](https://www.immobilienscout24.de)\
    - [immonet](https://www.immonet.de)

The scraped informations are checked for duplicates and the, the apartments are stored in a database. Before storing the data, for every apartment will be computed the coordinates. 
Every apartment object containts the following information, if they are available:
- domain
- date
- expose
- coldrent
- sidecosts
- surface
- roomnumber
- street
- postcode
- town
- latitude
- longitude
- hashvalue

This software containing links with search-results for the town. So, you can adjust the realEstateSpider.py for your needs. Also the to be collected informations.

For every town, you the this code to use the real-estate-monitor. Just pass for every spider the corresponding link with search results for apartments, and run the process.

```python
process.crawl(WggesuchtScraper, url=""https://www.wg-gesucht.de/wohnungen-in-Jena.66.2.1.0.html?offer_filter=1&city_id=66&noDeact=1&categories%5B%5D=2&rent_types%5B%5D=0"", town = tn)

process.crawl(ImmonetScraper, url=""https://www.immonet.de/immobiliensuche/sel.do?&sortby=0&suchart=1&objecttype=1&marketingtype=2&parentcat=1&city=111924&locationname=Jena"", town = tn)

process.crawl(Is24Scraper, url=""https://www.immobilienscout24.de/Suche/de/thueringen/jena/wohnung-mieten"", town = tn)
```

### choropleth
The choropleth.py is an additional software to evaluate the collected informations for a town and creating a choropleth map.

![alt text](choropleth.png ""choropleth map for jena"")

In this example picture, choropleth.py takes the value **2** and creating for every district the average coldrent for apartmants with a roomnumber of two. For creating a choropleth map, the coordinates are necessary.

Further, in the repository you can find datasets for berlin and jena with collected informations, stored in a JSON-File.

- If it shouldn't be performed, it exits and thanks the user

## Util Classes Usages
The util classes are in charge of everything that has to do with performing any transaction. They contain mostly static methods. this was used as an instance is not necessarily needed, to be created for each of the utility classes.

### HouseUtil.java
This includes worker static methods that perform listing Houses and getting the currently selected house

#### List of Houses
To get the list of manually stored Houses, call
```java
HouseUtil.getHouseList();
```
This is mostly used to initialize the list of houses and passed to the holding

#### List houses for buying transaction.

#### Single House
The user is to select by number the house he wishes to buy
```java
Scanner selectHouse = new Scanner(System.in);
int selection = selectHouse.nextInt();
House selectedHouse = HouseUtil.getSingleHouse(houseList, selection-1);
```
The `selection` variable is meant to hold the selected houses by number has a type of _int_

[//]: # (# TO BE CONTINUED)
### OrderUtil.java
This contains static classed that performs order specific duties

```java
OrderUtil.performHouseBuyingTransactions(houseList);
```

```java
OrderUtil.performHouseListing(houseList);
```

### MessageUtil.java
```java
MessageUtil.messenger(message);
```

```java
MessageUtil.writeInstruction(instruction);
```

```java
MessageUtil.giveUserFeedback(houseName, housePrice, transactionType);
```

### UserUtil.java
_Not implemented yet_
## Model Classes Usages
### House.java
Contains necessary house related members, including necessary getters and setters

This is a plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash).

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

## Documentation

The RETS input plugin can be configured very simply as shown below. Each `rets` input allows you to send as many queries as desired
against a single [MLS RETS server](www.reso.org/specifications).

The retrieved fields will be stored at the event root level by default (unless the `target` field is configured).

```
input {
  rets {
    url => ""http://mls.server.com/Login""
    username => ""retsuser""
    password => ""retspwd""
    user_agent => ""you/1.0""
    user_agent_password => ""uapwd""
    rets_version => ""RETS/1.5""
    # Supports ""cron"", ""every"", ""at"" and ""in"" schedules by rufus scheduler
    schedule => { cron => ""* * * * * UTC""}
    # The target field in which the RETS fields will be stored
    #target => ""rets_fields""
    # A hash of request metadata info (timing, response headers, etc.) will be sent here
    metadata_target => ""@rets_metadata""
    queries => {
      properties => {
        resource => ""Property""
        class => ""RE_1""
        query => ""(L_Status=|1_0,1_1,1_2)""

        limit => 1000
      }
    }
  }
}
output {
  stdout {
    codec => rubydebug

Here is how a sample event will look like:

```

### Configuration

The following list enumerates all configuration parameters of the `rets` input:

 * `url`: the Login URL to the MLS RETS server (required)
 * `username`: the username to log into the MLS RETS server (required)
 * `password`: the password to log into the MLS RETS server (required)
 * `user_agent`: the User-Agent to use when identifying to the MLS RETS server (required)
 * `user_agent_password`: the User-Agent password to use when identifying to the MLS RETS server (optional)
 * `rets_version`: the RETS version to use. Valid versions are `RETS/1.5`, `RETS/1.7`, `RETS/1.7.2`, `RETS/1.8` (required)
 * `schedule`: the [schedule specification](#scheduling) determining when the `rets` input must run (see below for details) (required)
 * `target`: the name of the field into which to store the pulled RETS fields (default: root) (optional)
 * `metadata_target`: the name of the field into which to store some metadata about the call (default: `@metadata` (optional)
 * `queries`: Any number of named queries mapped to a hash with the following parameters: (at least one required)
   * `resource`: the RETS resource to query (e.g. `Property`, `Agent`, etc)
   * `class`: the RETS class to query (e.g. `RE_1`, `LD_2`, `Agent`, etc)
   * `query`: the [DMQL query to send](https://www.flexmls.com/developers/rets/tutorials/dmql-tutorial/)
   * `select`: a comma-separated list of fields to pull, leave empty to pull all fields
   * `limit`: a number indicating how many records to pull at once

### Scheduling

This plugin must also be scheduled to run periodically according to a specific
schedule. This scheduling syntax is powered by [rufus-scheduler](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-scheduler).
The syntax is cron-like with some extensions specific to Rufus (e.g. timezone support ).

Examples:

```
* 5 * 1-3 *               | will execute every minute of 5am every day of January through March.
0 * * * *                 | will execute on the 0th minute of every hour every day.
0 6 * * * America/Chicago | will execute at 6:00am (UTC/GMT -5) every day.
```

Further documentation describing this syntax can be found [here](https://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-schedulerparsing-cronlines-and-time-strings).

## Need Help?

Need help? Try #logstash on freenode IRC or the https://discuss.elastic.co/c/logstash discussion forum.

## Developing

### 1. Plugin Developement and Testing

#### Code
- To get started, you'll need JRuby with the Bundler gem installed.

- Create a new plugin or clone and existing from the GitHub [logstash-plugins](https://github.com/logstash-plugins) organization. We also provide [example plugins](https://github.com/logstash-plugins?query=example).

- Install dependencies
```sh
bundle install
```

#### Test

- Update your dependencies

```sh
bundle install
```

- Run tests

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

### 2. Running your unpublished Plugin in Logstash

#### 2.1 Run in a local Logstash clone

- Edit Logstash `Gemfile` and add the local plugin path, for example:
```ruby
gem ""logstash-filter-awesome"", :path => ""/your/local/logstash-filter-awesome""
```
- Install plugin
```sh
bin/logstash-plugin install --no-verify
```
- Run Logstash with your plugin
```sh
bin/logstash -e 'filter {awesome {}}'
```
At this point any modifications to the plugin code will be applied to this local Logstash setup. After modifying the plugin, simply rerun Logstash.

#### 2.2 Run in an installed Logstash

You can use the same **2.1** method to run your plugin in an installed Logstash by editing its `Gemfile` and pointing the `:path` to your local plugin development directory or you can build the gem and install it using:

- Build your plugin gem
```sh
gem build logstash-filter-awesome.gemspec
```
- Install the plugin from the Logstash home
```sh
bin/logstash-plugin install /your/local/plugin/logstash-filter-awesome.gem
```
- Start Logstash and proceed to test the plugin

A project on exploratory data analysis.

Sebastian Thomas @ neue fische Bootcamp Data Science<br />
(datascience at sebastianthomas dot de)

This was my first project at the neue fische Bootcamp Data Science. It was centered around exploratory data analysis techniques and simple predictive analysis using ordinary linear regression. After the bootcamp, the analysis was extended.

The instances in the data set represent house sales. The task is to describe the impact of the given features on the house sales prices resp. to predict the latter with machine learning methods.

## Results

We have the following key insights:
- The distribution of house sale prices is left modal, with a median of about 0.5 million US Dollars.

![distribution of price][price]

- Location has a big impact on house sale price as can be visualized by the median house sale prices grouped by the zipcode:

![median prices grouped by zipcode][zipcodes]

The area with the highest housesale prices is Medina with zipcode 98039, a city in Eastside in the metropol region of Seattle.

![zipcodes map][zipcodes_map]

- There is a rough linear relationship between the living space area and the house sales price.

![living space][living_space]

- While there is a rough linear relationship between house condition and the house sales price, the quality of the interior (design/materials) has an exponential impact on the house sales price.

![condition grade][condition_grade]

- The better the view, the higher the house sales price. Most properties don't have an extraordinary view.

![view][view]

- If the house is on a waterfront, the median house sale price increases about 1 million US Dollars.

![waterfront][waterfront]

- The average error of the predictive model is about 12% (mean absolute percentage error) resp. $ 37,000 (median absolute error).

mdcnuydt,financial-modelling,,https://github.com/mdcnuydt/financial-modelling,https://api.github.com/repos/financial-modelling/mdcnuydt,Financial modelling for real estate. Excel focussed.,"# Intro

As a professional real estate investor, financial modelling is my bread and butter. It is the primary tool I use to make investment decisions. It is also something I love to play around with in my free time.

This repo collects some of the financial models I played around with in my free time and are solely intended for personal use. Some of them will be based on projects I have been involved in, others on courses I've taken and still others simply on projects I am fascinated by. A big thank you to the guys at [Breaking Into Wall Street](https://www.breakingintowallstreet.com) who provide a brilliant course to learn this stuff.

The information used in these projects are based primarily on publicly available data, supplemented with 'reasonable assumptions' on my part.

Each project will have its own folder with a case description and a financial model. Where possible I will try to include the sources I have used to substantiate my assumptions.

# Models

Currently I have uploaded two projects yet. I will soon add others once I have cleaned them up a bit.

**Current projects**
- *100 Bishopsgate*: Major office development in central London.
- *Jumeirah Beach Hotel*: Luxury hotel in Dubai.

PS: This repo is mainly focussed on traditional financial modelling in Excel. If, like me, you are fascinated by the potential for data science and machine learning in real estate investing, make sure to also check out [my other repo](https://github.com/mdcnuydt/data-science).

usametov,mls-node-script,,https://github.com/usametov/mls-node-script,https://api.github.com/repos/mls-node-script/usametov,MLS mini-scraper ,"The motivation 
================
To monitor real estate market in specific areas.
With this script you can see which properties are selling fast, and which properties stay on the market longer than others.
You can get insight into keywords. 



how to use this script:
=======================

* browse realtor.ca, run search for properties, using map mode.
* zoom in to specific area, make sure that you have less than 50 pages.
* open chrome developers tools
* switch to network tab
* select api call to api2.realtor.ca/Listing.svc/PropertySearch_Post
* right-click on it and choose ""copy as curl""
* open terminal (or command prompt)
* type node main.js &lt; paste your curl string from previous step &gt; 1 50 &lt;output dir of your choice &gt; 

The end result should look something like this:

<pre><code>
    node main.js curl 'https://api2.realtor.ca/Listing.svc/PropertySearch_Post' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/63.0' -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' --compressed -H 'Referer: https://www.realtor.ca/map' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8' -H 'Origin: https://www.realtor.ca' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' --data 'ZoomLevel=11&LatitudeMax=43.6579334&LongitudeMax=-79.4340402&LatitudeMin=43.4588965&LongitudeMin=-80.1433450&CurrentPage=1&RecordsPerPage=12&PropertyTypeGroupID=1&PropertySearchTypeId=1&TransactionTypeId=2&PriceMin=200000&PriceMax=550000&BedRange=1-0&BathRange=1-0&ApplicationId=1&CultureId=1&Version=7.0' 1 50 .
</pre></code>

***

After you run the above script, you should see the new file in the output directory. The file name is made of ISO date format and page range.
You may want to save the above command as shell script and run it, say, once in 3 days. 
 
This script can download up to 50 pages of MLS listings. This is because of realtor.ca API limit, they don't allow more than 50 calls.
This works fine though if you want to monitor specific area. 
Remember, you have to use map mode, it allows to zoom in to specific area.

# Kwame's Zillow Zestimates Error Control

Welcome to my data science clustering project: **Kwame's Zillow Zestimates Error Control**! This project will use clustering to find the drivers of error in the Zestimate of single-unit properties that were listed on Zillow in 2017. I will demonstrate how this data can be used for quality control and preventing more Zestimate errors in the future.

I plan to create an MVP and then iterate through the data science pipeline multiple times.

The project deliverables are the following: **Jupyter Notebook** data science pipeline walkthrough with **conclusions**, data **visualizations**, **README**, and **modules with functions** (```wrangle.py```, ```preprocessing.py```, ```explore.py```, and ```model.py```).

---

## Iterations through the Data Science pipeline

**Pipeline iteration 1:**
* Project plan and timeline
* README outline
* Structure project bones
* Reach the minimum/MVP for each stage to be able to move on to the next stage.

**Pipeline iteration 2:**
* Recalibrate project plan timeline
* Tidy the data a little further
* Put functions into modules
* Flesh out README
* Run one statistical test
* Explore and feature engineering with clustering

**Pipeline iteration 3 (to-do list):**
- [x] remove outliers with isolation forest
- [x] make README more thorough
- [x] add the data dictionary the hypotheses to README
- [x] review my notes and the project specs
- [x] turn cluster_area into dummy variables (i.e. is_cluster_area_1, is_cluster_area_2, etc.)
- [x] change statistical test to be better regarding the distribution of years
- [x] takeaways on how where to focus efforts to reduce log error
- [x] put remaining notebook code into functions
- [x] add two more models and test the best model on test data
- [x] copy comments from prepare code into presentation notebook
- [x] conclusions
- [x] practice presentation and make script/notes

**Things I'll save for future iterations for the sake of time:**
* title and label visualizations better
* plot centroids
* GeoPy implementation
* plot elevation's relation to latitude/longitude to see if log error has anything to do with topographical data
* make my module functions more generic and useful
* another hypothesis test

Instructions for use and reproduction:
## Main notebook
To see and read through the main notebook, you can navigate to ```kwames-zillow-zestimates-error-control.ipynb``` in this GitHub repository.

You can explore the functions from the notebook more indepth in the ```wrangle.py```, ```preprocessing.py```, ```explore.py```, and ```model.py``` files.

## Setup

In order to run the code in this repository, you'll need:

1. An installation of python through anaconda
2. An ```env.py``` file that defines the following variables:
  - 'user'
  - 'host'
  - 'password'

The code in here was developed on MacOS, but should run fine anywhere you can install python + anaconda.

Real estate investing platform where investors can buy/sell fractions of rental properties akin to buying stocks of companies. The advantages for buying just a fraction of rental properties are increased diversification and accessibility. You'll get a fraction of the rent and appreciation.

https://sean-hetzel.github.io/sunset-investing/

![Sunset Investing](sunset-investing-image.png)

# Usage

Users can:

1. View rental properties for sale. 
2. Create an account with Auth..
3. Invest a fraction of rental properties.
4. Sell fractions of their holdings.

# Roadmap

I'm not working on this anymore, but rather making a whole other second version v2 from scratch. This is so it can use a react compatible UI template instead.

# Installation:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# Purpose
The goal of this research is to analyze past housing data in order to predict the sell prices of homes and answer the following questions: 
   * Q1 - How are Houses in Kings County Distributed and the effect of Zipcodes on price?
   
   * Q2 - Does distance from the city have an effect on House Price?
   
   * Q3 - Are Waterfront properties more expensive?


# Data Description
Data files used:
   * cleaned_geodata.json
   * data_correlation_gone.csv
   * datawithnewcols.csv
   * kc_house_data.csv
   * Zip_Codes.geojson


## Question 1:
## How are Houses in Kings County Distributed and the effect of Zipcodes on price?

### [EDA](./Questions/Question1.ipynb)
#### Count by Zipcode
   <img src='images/mapwithcounts.png' width='60%'/> 

#### Price by Zipcode
   <img src='images/mapwithprice.png' width='60%'/>

### Conclusion
By analyzing the first map, we can see that zipcodes surrounding Bellevue have more houses than zipcodes further out. Upon closer look at the second map we can see the most expensive homes are concentrated in zipcodes North of the County closer to Bellevue and the cheaper homes are located south of the county. 

### Recommendation
The North of the County has some of the most expensive properties so I belive this region is in high demand so one could expect a good amount of return by investing in real estate within ths region.


# Question 2:
## Does distance from the city have an affect on House Price?

### [EDA](./Questions/Question2.ipynb)
#### Distance from closest city v Price
   <img src='images/distancexprice.png' width='60%'/>

#### Price v Size
   <img src='images/pricexsize.png' width='60%'/>

#### Distance from biggest city (Seattle) v Size
   <img src='images/seattlexsize.png' width='60%'/>

### Conclusion
By looking at the plot we can see houses above $1 milllion are located withing 20km of Bellevue. And for homes within 50km of Seattle, Although the price/house increases the bigger the sqft, the price/sqft reduces the the further away from Seattle a house is.

### Recommendation
I'll definitely recommend investing in homes 50km from Seattle which is also about 20km from Bellevue. By doing this you'll get more space for a less price which will also translate into higher returns.


# Question 3:
## Are Waterfront properties more expensive?

### [EDA](./Questions/Question3.ipynb)
   <img src='images/waterfront.png' width='60%'/>

### Conclusion
From analyzing the violin plots we can conclude that waterfront properties are more expensive than others with a mean and median price of $1.7 million and $1.5 million. Homes without a waterfront have a mean and median price of $532,000 and $450,000 respectively.

### Recommendation
Investing in waterfront properties would definitely be a smart move given there a difference of $1 million between the average home prices of a waterfront and no waterfront property.


# [Model 1](./models/model1.ipynb)
For the first model the independent variables I used were:
   * Grade
   * Area of inside home
   * Area of parking lot
   * Presence of waterfront
   * Age of home
   * Distance from Seattle
   * Distance from the airport

The equation for this model is:
    Price = (84890 * Area inside) + (-672.2227 * Area parking lot) + (341400 * Presence of waterfront) + (33230 * Age) + (-85020 * Distance from City) + (84890 * Distance from Airport) + (-44920 * Grade 5) + (-44720 * Grade 6) + (12400 * Grade 7) + (94390 * Grade 8) + (263600 * Grade 9) + (264300 * Grade 10) + (359800 * Grade 11)

### EDA
   <img src='images/model1.PNG' width='60%'/>

## Interpretion
The model uses the price of the home based on grade, then a positive adjustment is made for the area inside, presence of a waterfront, age, distance from airport, followed by a negative adjustment for area of the parking lot and distance from the city. The R2 score means theres a 71.7% variance in price.


# [Model 2](./model/model2.ipynb)
For the first model the independent variables I used were:
   * Grade
   * View
   * Area of inside home
   * Area of parking lot
   * Presence of waterfront
   * Age of home
   * Distance from Seattle
   * Distance from the airport

The equation for this model is:
    Price = (92650 * Area inside) + (-674.9984 * Area parking lot) + (226400 * Presence of waterfront) + (25930 * Age) + (-86480 * Distance from City) + (51940 * Distance from Airport) + (61750 * Grade) + (33280 * View) 

### EDA
   <img src='images/model2.PNG' width='60%'/>


## Interpretation
The model uses the price of the home based on grade, then a positive adjustment is made for the area inside, presence of a waterfront, age, distance from airport and view, followed by a negative adjustment for area of the parking lot and distance from the city. The R2 score means theres a 95.5% variance in price.


# [Final Model](./models/Final_Model.ipynb)
For the first model the independent variables I used were:
   * Grade
   * Area of inside home
   * Area of parking lot
   * Number of bedrooms
   * Number of bathrooms
   * Distance from closest city

The equation for this model is:
    Price = (84541 * Area inside) + (24190 * Area parking lot) + (-12510 * Number of bedrooms) + (3849.4898 * Number of bathrooms) + (-109100 * Distance from City) + (429646 * Grade 4) + (410804 * Grade 5) + (400781 * Grade 6) + (441474 * Grade 7) + (499282 * Grade 8) + (588835 * Grade 9) + (648431 * Grade 10) + (707515 * Grade 11)

### EDA
   <img src='images/Final.png' width='60%'/>


## Interpretation
The model uses the price of the home based on grade, then a positive adjustment is made for the area inside, area of parking lot, bathrooms, followed by a negative adjustment for bedrooms and distance from the city. The R2 score means theres a 70.1% variance in price.

# Future Work
   * Zip code Feature - Create a boundary selector to enable the model to predict price depending on zip code.

   * More Data - Collate data for the passed 20 years to see how the house prices have changed and also the distinct trends, such as malls, theatres, etc. in different zip codes and how they effect the prices of homes.
   
   * Explore the effects of the distance from a city on presence and size of a basement.

This project explores real estate data trends and makes some prediction for future outcomes. Of particular interest is predicting active listings by month.

## Results
View the [fbprohpet notebook](fb-prophet-forecast.ipynb) for the current set of interesting results including the detailed predictions. Here's a look at the chart output:

![forecast](https://i.imgur.com/5VrXXa4.png)
![decomposition](https://i.imgur.com/8jMDKUK.png)

## Motivation
 It is at the present *very* difficult to purchase a house in the market I am interested in, which in my case are the exurbs of the Boston metro. Housing inventory seems to be nonexistent. It's a bad sign when you open Zillow in the morning to find every house has already been clicked on, and no new ones are being added.
 
 I'm mainly motivated by gathering some data on when I expect the housing inventory to pick, and by what magnitude will it increase by. I don't need to pick the time of year when prices are lowest. Instead, I want some idea of when the feeding frenzy might relax.
## Getting Started
This was developed with `jupyterlab v2.2.9` and `Python 3.8`.

Install the prerequisite Python packages by running in your terminal `pip -r requirements.txt`

Create your personal `zipcodes.csv` file, per the [instructions](#Data-Files) below in this readme.

Start by running [download-mls-data](download-mls-data.ipynb) notebook to get the data.

Then run the [fb-prophet-forecast](fb-prophet-forecast.ipynb) notebook to create your market predictions.

The R packages can be installed inside of the notebook.
## Data Files
Most of the data files are provided by [Realtor.com Research Data](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/). The inventory data dates back to July 2016 on a monthly basis.

The other data file you will need is `zipcodes.csv`. You will need to create this yourself. The schema is:
| Zipcode | City                |Rank
| --------| -----------         | ---
| 90210   | Beverly Hills, CA   | 2
| 03301   | Concord, NH         | 1
| 10017   | New York, NY        | 2

Where Rank is a an at this time unused ranking I gave the various zipcodes based on how desirable I think living in them in. It is unused but I have created in case I wish to implement certain weighted scores in the future.

This purpose of `zipcodes.csv` is to provide a filter on the original MLS dataset. Thus, the novelty here is to predict housing trends _only in the regions you are interested in_. From a modeling persepective, it makes sense if these are geographically adjacent. Think of it like creating your own personal county.

### Errata
I've noticed an error in the source Realtor.com data, notably that `postal_code` has the leading 0 stripped of it, for postal_codes that begin with 0.

## TODO
- [ ] Import the .csv files into a database
- [ ] Manage an ETL to append only the _new_ data into the appropriate DB table. I want to save the oldest data in case Realtor.com's csv files have a fixed row limit.
- [ ] Fix the data errata like stripping 0s from zipcodes upon data import

# ImmoEliza-API

To create an API that will make price forecasts on houses or apartments according to certain parameters (postal code, number of rooms, surface area, etc.)

* Website (AI Dev) - https://immoeliza-real-estate.herokuapp.com/

* Github page - https://kaiyungtan.github.io/ImmoEliza-API/

* Website (Web Dev) - Under construction

* Github repo (Web Dev) - https://github.com/VieiraHenrique/testPhp (Under construction)

## Background

This project is a collaboration between BeCode AI and the BeCode Web 
Dev team.

The AI developers will create an API and the web developers will develop an interface for the client ""ImmoEliza"". 

The main process is about a collaboration between the AI and the web dev so that all have to be in sync in order to know how to construct the form.

Team Members consists of: 

* AI Dev  : Adam 

* Web Dev : Valentin, Henrique, Nathana√´l 

    
## Mission objectives  

* Be able to create a prediction model
* Be able to deploy model
* Be able to work in a team
* Be able to build an api

## The Mission

You need to create an API that will make price forecasts on houses or apartments according to certain parameters (postal code, number of rooms, surface area, etc...). This API will be used by web devs who will be able to use it to create an interface for the ImmoEliza agency.


## Use Case examples:
 
* to find out what is the predicted price of a house or apartment based on your selection criteria.
* to compare the asking price of what is posted on the real estate website i.e ImmoWeb with what is predicted price.
* to compare the price per square meter of the property with the average price per square meter of the city


### Must-have features

* The api must be functional 
* Your model must be functional


### Additional features

* to provide house/apartment average price (square per meter) for all cities in Belgium
* to show the difference (%) between house/apartment sq/m2 versus the average sq/m2 for the city


## Machine Learning Process Overview

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69633814/100385145-1ab4a600-3022-11eb-9674-af2276a16f9e.png)

## Business Understanding 

* Getting a good estimate of the price of a house or apartment is hard even for the most seasoned real estate agents. It involves a lot of variables. The owner of the property can determine the price based on many factors. The property itself is of course the main factor to determine the price. However the location and facilities around the property can hugely impact the price. In addition, the inflation rate or personal reason can also play a part in influencing the price.

* In this project, we are using different machine learning algorithms to learn from the features of the real estate in order to predict the price. The models neither take into account of the facilities around the real estate , nor it include other external factors i.e COVID-19 effect on the housing prices.

* The price prediction is based on the price that posted on the website and not the actual transaction of the property. With this in mind, we can assume that when listing the property , most of the owner will probably put a higher price for room of negoatiation.

* According to [STATBEL](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/themes/housing/house-price-index#news):

	* The observed annual inflation rate for house prices amounts to 4.5 % in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 3.5 % in the previous quarter.

	* The average inflation rate for the last four quarters amounts to 4.3 %.

	* The house price index went up by 1.4 % in the second quarter of 2020 compared to the previous quarter.

	* The house price index can be broken down by new houses and existing houses. In the second quarter of 2020, annual inflation amounted to 5.3 % for new houses and 4.3 % for existing houses. 

note: The house price index measures the price evolution with the assumption that the characteristics of the property sold remain unchanged.


## Data Understanding

* The dataset for the real estate were scrapped form [Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be/) probably the biggest real estate website in Belgium mid of September 2020 with more than 50,000 of properties including houses and apartments from a previous BeCode [Data Collecting Challenge](https://github.com/kaiyungtan/challenge-collecting-data).

* Initially the dataset have 52077 rows and 20 columns and after data cleaning it was reduced to 40395 rows (observations) and 18 columns.

* In order to get geographical informations about the data, Postal Codes dataset from [https://data.gov.be/](https://data.gov.be/fr/dataset/328ba4f140ba0e870dfc9c70635fe7c1840980b1) is merged with  the real estate dataset during a previous BeCode [Real Estate Data analysis](https://github.com/kaiyungtan/Real-Estate-data-analysis).


## Data Preparation

* After further data cleaning, the dataset was reduced to 24040 rows (observations) with 19 columns.(belgium_real_estate_2020_rev1_19.11.2020.csv)

* Then the dataset were seperated to 2 dataset seperately namely df_house for houses and df_apartment for apartements.[Belgium_Real_Estate_2020](https://github.com/kaiyungtan/ImmoEliza-API/blob/main/notebook/Belgium_Real_Estate_2020_Immoweb%20-%20House%20%26%20Apartment.ipynb)

	- df_house (10254 rows, 19 columns)(belgium_houses_20.11.2020.csv)
	- df_apartment (13207 rows, 18 columns) (belgium_apartments_20.11.2020.csv')

*  to compare predicted price square per meter with the average price square per meter of a city, a seperate dataset was prepared to have only 7 columns:[Price_Sqm](https://github.com/kaiyungtan/ImmoEliza-API/blob/main/notebook/Data_analysis%20%26%20Create%20Price_Sqm.ipynb)
		- city_name	
		- postal_code	
		- price_sqm	
		- region	
		- province	
		- longitude	
		- lattitude

* 2 folium map were created to show average price square per meter in each city for houses and apartement. 
	* [average_house_price](https://immoeliza-real-estate.herokuapp.com/map_average_house_price)
	* [average_apartment_price](https://immoeliza-real-estate.herokuapp.com/map_average_apartment_price)

## Modeling

*  The objective of machine learning is not a model that does well on training data, but one that demonstrates it satisfies the business need and can be deployed on live data.

* A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data.

* Libraries used in this project as follow:

## API for web dev

* two API routes were created for web dev to access the api namely:

	* https://immoeliza-real-estate.herokuapp.com/predict_house_tojson2
	* https://immoeliza-real-estate.herokuapp.com/predict_apartment_tojson2

* it returns a json file with 4 key value pairs:

	* ""1. predicted price"" : str(output)
    * ""2. predicted price_sqm"" : str(pricem2)
    * ""3. {city_name} average price_sqm"" : str(price_sqm)
    * ""4. difference(%)"" : str(difference_pct)


* tested api with [postman](https://www.postman.com)

## Challenges

* time spent on training models
* deployment on heruko


## Limitation

* only for prediction price of general houses or apartments, it doesn't include subtype of property like villa,town-house,mansion,other exceptional property, country house.

* when unseen data is one of the subtype of property, the model predicted price will have higher difference of the price.


## Further Development

* To obtain more recent dataset from immoweb or other property websites  
* To include other features:

	*	Amenities : cellar? attic? parking?
	*	View of the property
	* 	Energy class
	*	Number of floors (for apartment)
	*	Elevator (for apartment)

* Explore other machine algorithms i.e CatBoost, LightGBM
* To propose related property on the website based on the inputs and predicted price
* To predict rental prices of houses or apartments
* Deployment model in virtual service in the cloud: 
	* Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 Instance   
	* Google Cloud platform 
	* Azure Cloud

* To include range of prediction i.e 10% lower or higher of the predicted price

brandonabela,Malta-Property-Analysis,,https://github.com/brandonabela/Malta-Property-Analysis,https://api.github.com/repos/Malta-Property-Analysis/brandonabela,Ranking real estate investment opportunities in Malta using multi-threaded scraping of rental features from multiple real estate agencies to identify the best investment options based on correlation and similarity.,"# Malta Property Analysis

This project aims to uncover the most profitable real estate opportunities in Malta by comparing and ranking properties for sale against similar rental properties. By analysing key features of each property, we are able to identify those with the highest potential return on investment (ROI).

## Dataset Compilation

For the analysis of the property market to occur, a dataset had to be compiled. The selenium python package was used for this purpose, with the implementation of multithreading to allow for concurrent scraping of multiple websites. The websites ```Alliance```, ```Belair```, ```Ben Estates```, ```Dhalia```, ```Frank Salt```, ```Remax```, ```Sara Grech``` were scraped for properties for sale and rental. In addition, ```Quicklets``` was scraped specifically for rental properties and ```Zanzi``` was scraped for properties for sale.

![Source Distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23166383/215691494-a33f8c7a-3f80-44c5-93f2-80055c4457cc.png)


Every data source had its own unique logic to ensure that every feature was at a common baseline, and every data source was saved as a separate ```CSV```. The use of multithreading in the scraping process allowed for efficient and quick compilation of a comprehensive dataset containing information on properties for sale and rental from multiple sources, providing a thorough understanding of the current property market in the area.

The following details highlight the key features extracted from the website sources for both sale and rental properties.
- **Is_Sale**: This feature indicates whether the property is for sale or not. It is a boolean variable (e.g. True or False) where True indicates that the property is for sale and False indicates that it is not.
- **Source**: This feature indicates the source website where the information of the property was scraped from.
- **Reference**: The reference is a unique identifier that is specific to the website source and can be used to easily locate the property within that source.
- **Town**: This feature specifies the city where the property is located.
- **Type**: This feature indicates the type of property. Examples include house, apartment, villa, etc.
- **Stage**: This feature denotes the current stage of development of the property. It can be categorized as on plan, shell, finished, furnished, unconverted, or unclassified.
- **Bedrooms**: This feature indicates the number of bedrooms in the property.
- **Bathrooms**: This feature indicates the number of bathrooms in the property.
- **TotalSqm**: This feature indicates the total area of the property measured in square meters.
- **IntArea**: This feature indicates the internal area of the property measured in square meters.
- **ExtArea**: This feature indicates the external area of the property measured in square meters.
- **Price**: This feature specifies the cost of the property, denoted in Euro currency.

## Dataset Processing

After the data scraping has finished, the data processing starts by loading all the data sources and eliminating the types and towns that are not in the scope. The stage, type and town features are mapped to eliminate variations in wording. The town feature represents the province, latitude and longitude features. If any of the features: Is_Sale, Source, Reference, Town and Type are missing, the entire record is removed.

If the total square meter is not filled but the interior and external areas are provided, the total square meter can be implied. Furthermore, a statistical method of Z-score is applied to eliminate prices that have an absolute value greater than 1 based on the type.

The following are explanations of the implied features:
- **Province**: This feature specifies the region in which the property is located, such as North, East, South, West, Central and Gozo.
- **Latitude**: This feature denotes the geographical position of the town relative to the distance north or south of the equator.
- **Longitude**: This feature measures the town's geographical location in relation to the distance east or west of the Prime Meridian.

## Data Analysis

The dataset contains 86,906 rows and 16 columns. There are 75,291 missing values in the External Area and Internal Area columns, 56,168 missing values in the Total Square meter column, and 4,831 missing values in the Bathrooms column. All missing values in the dataset have been filled with the value ```unclassified```.

![City Plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23166383/215432109-0221dc71-7e99-4cc7-a3d3-27766bc2ad51.png)

The data reveals that Remax, Frank Salt, and Zanzi have the highest number of properties for sale, while Remax, QuickLets, and Frank Salt have the highest number of rental listings. In regards to property staging, Remax leads in properties on plan, shell, and finished stages. Meanwhile, Frank Salt has the most furnished properties. Additionally, Ben Estate has the largest number of properties without proper classification.

The top 10 towns in terms of combined property listings for sales and rental are ```Sliema```, ```Saint Julian's```, ```Gzira```, ```Swieqi```, ```Marsaskala```, ```Saint Paul's Bay```, ```Msida```, ```Qawra```, ```Mellieha```, and ```Mosta```. ```Saint Paul's Bay``` has the most property listings for sale, while ```Sliema``` has the most property listings for rent. For sale apartments, the 1st quartile is 225K, the median is 265K, and the 3rd quartile is 319K. For rental apartments, the 1st quartile is 900, the median is 1200, and the 3rd quartile is 1500.

![Top 10 Towns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23166383/215691237-85a6c587-75e4-406d-8a6b-539f89f4242c.png)

When analysing the correlation between features and the sale price, it has been determined that the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and external area are positively correlated with the sale price. This means that as these features increase, the sale price is likely to increase as well. On the other hand, the total square meter and internal area have no correlation with the sale price.

When analysing the relationship between various features and the rent price, no correlation was found. This may be due to a number of other factors playing a significant role in determining the rent price, such as the location of the property and the quality of its finishing. These factors, rather than the features mentioned, are likely to be the primary drivers of rent prices.

## Conclusions

The ```sale_price.csv``` file groups sale listings using the columns ```Type```, ```Province```, ```Town```, ```Bedrooms```, and ```Stage```. The ```rent_price.csv``` file groups rental listings using similar columns as ```sale_price.csv```, but excluding ```Stage```. Both outputs perform the following aggregations for each group:

- **Reference**: count of the number of references or listings in each group.
- **Bathrooms**: median of the number of bathrooms in each group.
- **IntArea**: median of the internal area (in square meters) in each group.
- **ExtArea**: median of the external area (in square meters) in each group.
- **Price**: minimum, maximum, and median of the price in each group.

The aggregations of both ```sale_price.csv``` and ```rent_price.csv``` were combined based on the rental columns, with a requirement for references to be greater than 2 for both sales and rental. This guaranteed that the grouping of properties would be meaningful and not include outliers in their ranking. This resulted in 1868 unique groups. Metrics such as downpayment amount, loan amount, repayment monthly, vacancy monthly, repairs monthly, management monthly, and cash on cash return were computed for each group. The top 5 groups, sorted by cash on cash return, were: penthouse in Kalkara with 3 bedrooms on plan, house of character in Birkirkara with 3 bedrooms unclassified, penthouse in Kalkara with 3 bedrooms finished, apartment in Ta' Xbiex with 3 bedrooms furnished, and apartment in Saint Julians with 3 bedrooms unclassified.

The ranking process of property sales is based on an aggregation per listing and the cash on cash return. The top 5 listings with the highest cash on cash return, ranging from 151 to 63, are as follows:

1. House of Character in Zebbug with 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms (unclassified)
2. House of Character in Zejtun with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms (furnished)
3. House of Character in Birkirkara with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathroom (unclassified)
3. House of Character in Birkirkara with 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom (unclassified)
4. House of Character in Birkirkara with 3 bedrooms and 1 bathroom (furnished)

These properties have been listed based on their cash on cash return, which is a financial metric used to evaluate the potential profitability of a real estate investment. The properties listed above offer a high return on investment, making them attractive options for potential buyers.

A data scraper from texas govt site and a helping web app for managing, reviewing and editing the data

A friend of mine taken data entry contract for for their farm. It was a lot of data.
You need to go the govt site of Texas, serch city one by one, go to the company/customer lists and copy those data to excel steet. It could take one mongth (two weeks if two person did this) for a single data entry operator or analyst to add those data and keep those data organized in excel steet.

In the middle of their work I told them to tell me all the problems they are facing and all the fetures/issues this site have.
I analyzed the source code of the site and also saw that there are some issue with sessions so it is not an easy task to make a scraper fot the site. But still after testing and tricking the site I made a very simple but perfect scraper. Mined all the data and then made an admin panel for the data entry operators and/or analysts.

It's no facncy work but it's a two pieces software that made their work very easy and some great amount of money with perfect data output and client satisfaction. I am uploading this project for those who may need such apps and may use my work as reference or helper to build theri project or may directly use this (with some variable value change) if their work is similar.

Note: I made this two pieces software for having the work done perfectly and deveoped it very quickly. So, I did not follow all the best practices of software development and good practices of python. Even regular expressions used here are perfect but not clean because it was made to have the work done perfectly not to make it a viral project.


You can contact me through http://sabuj.me or go to my linkedin account where my user name is SabujXi or also same user name on twitter or facebook.

Below are some screenshots - I haven't taken any screenshot during scraping, so the following screenshots are from the panel of data entry/analyst operator.

https://bscscan.com/token/0x919efd12babc1f93ad19330fbb35e9bb16fb89e9

#### Stiff Money DEED staking smart contract is still undergoing testing now, and we strongly advise not to deposit anything on the mainnet until we publicly launch the product. https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x6efead432cf746a44d39d368fcdf59a95f6c86f9

## Definition and description

$DEED tokens are governing tokens built on BEP20 Binance Smart Chain. The Staking Contract has a 10% APY LP rewards on $DEED staked into the Stiff Money smart contract.

$DEED tokens in circulation represent a $1 equivalent of $BNB swapped. $DEED can be staked on a smart contract that programmatically rewards LP providers with a fixed 10% APY paid in $DEED.

Those with $DEED staked on Stiff Money‚Äôs smart contract can vote on regions to acquire single family homes that are then resold on leased-to-own terms to homebuyers.

To acquire $DEED tokens intillay you can swap $BNB at https://stiffmoney.com/BNB-swap/ using a smart contract with zero fees until LP cap is reached.

## Stiff Money Governing Token

### Objective

Stable APY to attract liquidity providers who want to help others become homeowners. 
To provide $DEED stakers easy way to vote on where to buy real estate.
To provide PEOPLE more opportunities to own a home.

### Token model

-Initial market cap. $10,000,000 (10,000,000 $DEED)
-Stable model. 1 $DEED in circulation equals $1+ in real estate value
-Circulation. 10% increase in number of tokens each year based on #staked
-Fair launch. No pre-mine or team/advisors starting with any balances
-Zero Fees: No transaction cost or gas fees for staking or swapping 

## Governing Token Distribution

$5,000,000 worth of $BNB can be swapped at a 1 $DEED to $1.00 worth of $BNB exchange rate. Staking $DEED provides 10% APY based on the number of $DEED staked.

-50% of $DEED available for $BNB swap
-50% of $DEED available for Staking Rewards

Stiff Money has a model to use profits from the re-selling of real estate to buy back $DEED to keep a stable balance between staked $DEED and $DEED held for LP rewards, and maintain a greater than $1 per $DEED collateralization.

## Governing Token Framework

$DEED token holders can easily participate in shaping the decisions on where Stiff Money purchases single family homes using the platform.

Each $DEED token STAKED is counted as 1 vote.

Anyone with 100+ $DEED tokens staked can vote for any place in the world to be considered as a place to invest.

All proposals on where to invest are subject to a 60 day voting period, and any address with voting power can vote for or against the proposal. If a majority of votes are YES for the proposed region, it is added to the queue, and properties with profit potential will be searched for in that region. 

### Voting

All voting is done at https://stiffmoney.com/ with zero gas cost(no transaction fees).

### Quorum

At Least 51% of the total amount of $DEED staked needs to vote on a proposal for it to be valid, or else it will fail automatically. Also, at least 51% of the votes for it must be YES for it to pass.

This simulation and model is devised as an attempt to discover actual returns an
investor should expect from residential real estate, assuming that future markets will
behave similarly to past markets.

I don't assume that future markets will __perform__ similarly to past markets,
but rather that they will be __behaviorally__ similar to past markets.

## Objective:

Thanks to Idealista API,  a dataset with information for many apartments in a certain area can be downloaded.

Using this dataset, this project aims to build a renting price prediction model. 

The use case is that once the user (myself, since I am looking right now for accommodation) has selected a few apartments in which he is interested. He passes them through the model, that will give an estimated price for the property. This price can be compared with the real one to detect bargains or overpriced properties.

ApartmentGate is an Android App for browsing apartment listings in San Francisco, with data from Apartments.com.
The app takes information about the user's work address, work hours, preferred method of commute, ideal budget,
apartment size, and preferred atmosphere, and uses this profile information to grade apartment listings based
on how closely they fit the user's criteria. The user's preferences can be changed anytime, and the grades of
apartment listings will be recomputed accordingly. In addition, the app uses information from all users to
show information regarding the most popular neighborhoods in San Francisco, and the average rent paid for
listings in those neighborhoods. To learn more about this project, see the writeup: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ayQ5g0qbl4OtGOBDV0ITrwSb7HU9cpAF2meZeHnpJ0Q/edit?usp=sharing

alfonx,valueR,,https://github.com/alfonx/valueR,https://api.github.com/repos/valueR/alfonx,Access VALUE market data using R,"
<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

# valueR <img src=""inst/logo/hex.png"" align=""right"" height=""160""/>

The goal of valueR is to facilitate access to real estate market data
from VALUE AG‚Äôs Market Data team via our API interfaces with R.

## Development

This package emerged from our own analyses of VALUE market data using R
that we would like to make available to our users. The package is still
under active development and we are happy to receive hints on
enhancements to the functionality.

## Installation

You can install the development version of valueR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages(""devtools"", dependencies = T)
devtools::install_github(""alfonx/valueR"")
```

## API

With valueR you can access two of our REST-APIs:

##### **ANALYST**

VALUE ANALYST is based on our real estate market database, which
provides up-to-date and comprehensive information on prices, rents and
yields of the German real estate market. Most users access our database
via our GUI ‚ÄúAnalyst‚Äù, we therefore refer to this access as ‚ÄúAnalyst‚Äù in
the context of valueR.

If you have a VALUE license with API/REST access, you can find the
Swagger documentation [here](https://api.value-marktdaten.de/api-docs/).

##### **AVM**

VALUE AVM is a fully comprehensive solution for automated value
indication and system-supported derivation of market and lending values.
With the AVM, different value indications and also object and location
parameters can be fetched. The latter are currently not yet implemented
in valueR.

If you have a VALUE license with AVM-API/REST access, you can find the
Swagger documentation
[here](https://avm-api.value-marktdaten.de/v1/api-docs/).

## USAGE

To access VALUE Analyst and VALUE AVM you need a license with individual
access data for each. Without valid credentials, the use of valueR is
pointless. Please contact us if you would like a [trial
license](https://www.value-marktdaten.de/en/contact/).

To load the package, run

``` r
library(valueR)
```

You will be asked to provide you credentials using `valuer_access()`:

``` r
#> Unable to connect to AVM.
#> Unable to connect to ANALYST.
#> Please connect with valuer_access() to AVM or ANALYST.
```

To avoid having to enter credentials every time, valueR recognizes the
following system variables:

-   VALUER_ANALYST_USER

-   VALUER_ANALYST_PW

-   VALUER_AVM_USER

-   VALUER_AVM_PW

It is highly recommended to set these variable using `Sys.setenv()` in
[.Renviron](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047157094-Managing-R-with-Rprofile-Renviron-Rprofile-site-Renviron-site-rsession-conf-and-repos-conf).

Developers with access to our testing-systems might also set
`VALUER_AVM_URL` and `VALUER_ANALYST_URL` which both default to our
live-systems if not provided.

Once you have provided your credentials, you will be logged in:

``` r
#> Connected to AVM: https://avm-api.value-marktdaten.de/v1
#> Connected to ANALYST: https://api.value-marktdaten.de/
```

## ANALYST EXAMPLES

First, you might check the system status by

``` r
analyst_status()
```

There are some information on your license, e.g.¬†the segments of your
license

``` r
analyst_segments() %>% dplyr::select(key, titleEn) %>% head(5)
#>        key                                                   titleEn
#> 1    WHG_M                                 Flats/apartments for rent
#> 2    WHG_K                             Flats/apartments for purchase
#> 3   EZFH_K                     Single/two-family houses for purchase
#> 4   EZFH_M                         Single/two-family houses for rent
#> 5 MFHWGH_K Multi-family houses, residential and commercial buildings
```

``` r

#>                      key                         titleEn
#> 1             aadr_firma        Company name of provider
#> 2 aadr_gewerblich_janein             Commercial provider

analyst_spatial(type = 'municipalities') %>% head(5) %>% dplyr::select(municipalityCode,municipality)
#>   municipalityCode municipality
#> 1          1001000    Flensburg
#> 2          1002000         Kiel
#> 3          1003000       L√ºbeck
#> 4          1004000   Neum√ºnster
#> 5          1051001   Albersdorf
```

Each of these functions return a `data.frame()` inlcuding all available
descriptions.

To start a query, you must create a query on a given segment, with the
provided filter conditions using `analyst_id()`. The returned ID can be
used in subsequent API requests to access the data described by this
query. The ID is only valid for 6 hours, before it expires and has to be
posted again. A query must be provided as JSON, e.g.

``` r
id <- analyst_id(json = '{""segment"": ""WHG_K"",""administrativeSpatialFilter"": {""postalCodes"": [23558]}}',query_id = T)
id
#> [1] 17780526
```

To create a valid JSON, you can also create a query in our ANALYST GUI
and get the corresponding JSON output. Note that due to `query_id = T`,
`analyst_id()` will return only an integer that can be used for further
requests that return an object of class `analyst_class`.

This class is a structured list of objects from which you can choose. In
most cases, you probably want to refer to `values` that include a tidy
`data.frame()` of results. But you might also use the returned `JSON` to
start a new query. Let‚Äôs say, you want to create an ID for the
counterpart to your original request, you could than use
`analyst_queries()` to get the counterpart

``` r
counterpart <- analyst_queries(id = id, subquery = 'counterpart')
class(counterpart)
#> [1] ""analyst_class""
```

and then getting a new ID for that counterpart:

``` r
counterpart$json
#> {""segment"":[""WHG_M""],""administrativeSpatialFilter"":{""postalCodes"":[23558]}}

id_counter <- analyst_id(json = counterpart$json,query_id = T)
id_counter
#> [1] 17791137
```

You‚Äôre then ready to get all results of your original request and its
counterpart using `analyst_results()`. E.g. to get a timeline of both
requests, set `subquery = 'timeline'` and provide `yearParts`.

``` r

# Leave variable empty to get available variables:
analyst_results(id, subquery = 'timeline', yearparts = 2)$values$key
#> You will find available variables to get timeline results for your queryId 17780526 at values$keys.
#> [1] ""einnahmen_kaufpreisfaktor"" ""einnahmen_rendite""        
#> [3] ""kosten_je_flaeche""         ""kstn_kaufpreis""

orig <- analyst_results(id, subquery = 'timeline', variable = 'kosten_je_flaeche', yearparts = 2) 
orig_seg <- analyst_queries(id = id, subquery = 'queryId')$values$segment # get segment of ID
orig_v <- orig$values %>% dplyr::mutate(segment = orig_seg)

counter <- analyst_results(id_counter, subquery = 'timeline', variable = 'kstn_miete_kalt_pqm', yearparts = 2)
counter_seg <- analyst_queries(id = id_counter, subquery = 'queryId')$values$segment # get segment of counter ID
counter_v <- counter$values %>% dplyr::mutate(segment = counter_seg)

# combine both queries and compute index to plot results:

results <- orig_v %>% dplyr::bind_rows(counter_v) %>% 
    dplyr::group_by(segment) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(index = value / value[date == min(date)] * 100)
```

<img src=""man/figures/README-plot-1.png"" width=""100%"" />

With `analyst_results()` and the corresponding ID, all predefined
results can be retrieved. You can also get all single offers of the
query by setting `subquery = 'offers'` to run your own statistics and
analysis.

Please note that due to technical reasons a maximum of 100,000
individual offers can be retrieved. Currently, valueR does not yet
contain an automated procedure to retrieve larger data sets. This
limitation will be fixed soon.

Please also note that the ANALYST API also includes an endpoint to
retrieve georeferencing of an address. Currently, this endpoint cannot
be accessed with valueR. This limitation should also be fixed soon.

## Introduction <a name=""introduction""></a>
The client is a Real Estate company that invests in large cities by buying properties to later rent them out as vacation apartments.

The managers have made the decision to invest in Madrid, and are interested in analysing the data that the sector leader AirBnb makes public to try to find the types of properties that have the greatest commercial potential for vacation rental.

As a main deliverable, the management expects to receive the typology (or typologies) of properties that the valuation team should look for among the existing opportunities in the city and the main neighborhoods or geographic areas to focus on.

- [See a technical explanation of the project here.](https://pedrocorma.github.io/project/5realstate/)

## Objectives <a name=""objectives""></a>
Analysing available public data sources to find insights that help to understand the characteristics of the market in Madrid city and guide the valuation team‚Äôs research work, especially in terms of the main angles: rental prices, occupancy levels and purchase prices.

## Project results  <a name=""project-results""></a>
**1. 10 neighborhoods with a high investment potential have been identified**

- There are 10 neighborhoods that a priori can maximize the cost-income ratio.
- They can also be segmented by the type and quality of the property in which we are interested in investing in 4 main groups.
- These are the neighborhoods where to start looking for specific opportunities:
  - Low Investment: Simancas, Ambroz, Marroquina, San Juan Bautista.
  - Medium investment: El Plantio, Valdemar√≠n, Valdefuentes.
  - Medium-high investment: Jer√≥nimos, Fuentela reina.
  - High investment: Recoletos.

**2. It is recommended to search for one-bedroom properties that can accommodate 3 guests.**

- The number of guests that maximizes the purchase price paid is 3.

**3. It is recommended to search for properties in one of the identified neighborhoods that are not necessarily close to points of interest.**

- This properties are expected to have a lower purchase price.
- It appears that proximity to points of interest does not have a particular impact on rental prices.

**4. A new business model based on rentals for specific moments of high sporting interest, especially in the San Blas neighborhood should be explored.**

- It is advisable to look for opportunities in the San Blas neighborhood.
- The relationship between the purchase price and the rental price per night is quite good.
- There are still many rentals that are not exploiting this potential.

# Who did the project (Who):
Contributors : Joachim Kotek (JK), Francesco Mariottini (FM), Orhan Nurkan (ON), Saba Yahyaa (SY)

# Development (How)

## Communication and Management
Communication went mainly through live discussion on-site and, to a smaller extent, on Discord. Project management was mainly carried on Trello with each person adding indipendently the labels and tasks as well as involving other team members on them. 

## Merging datasets from different sources (How)
Different indipendent teams worked on a merged dataset to be used by all the team.
On the first day (21/10/20) CUDA team splitted the sources (5 was excluded not being good enough) as follows: JK worked on source 3 and 4, FM worked on source 1 and 7, ON worked on source 2, 3 and 6. Group 3 required collaboration. Additional cleaning work was carried on the 22/10/20 by JK to improve the merged dataset for all the teams.

## Pycharm & Github training (How)
At least 2 person days were spent on technical teaching (and installation) and clarifications about pycharm (FM), git (FM, JK) and statistics (FM) to allow everybody to work on the project. Additional self-training was spent by SY on understanding and replicating the code already developed by the team.

## Code merging (How)
JK toke sole responsibility for merging the code in order to effectively implement code from different sources (git and jupyter files) and eventually reviewing the code if necessary.

## Data formatting and values cleaning (How)
Data cleaning was splitted into two main groups: initial formatting for similar types of columns (FM) and additional specific formatting for particularly complex cleaning.
FM toke reponsibility for the overall cleaning including: formatting to the required types, identification of string representing na (and replacement by na), extraction of simple numbers from text. ON worked on cleaning and aggregating the categorical values with multiple text values like subtype of property, location and state of the building. JK cleaned the postcode and toke over on price cleaning.

The resulting dataset before the first analysis is the following:
information|column name|variable type|example(s) or description
---|---|---|---
Source (team)|source|int|from 1 to 7|
Hyperlink|hyperlink|str||
Locality|locality|str||
Postcode|postcode|int||
Type of property (House/apartment)|house_is|bool||
Subtype of property|property_subtype|str|Bungalow, Chalet, Mansion, ...|
Price|price|int||
Type of sale (Exclusion of life sales)|sale|str|
Number of rooms|rooms_number|int|
Area|area|int|
Fully equipped kitchen (Yes/No)|kitchen_has|bool|
Furnished (Yes/No)|furnished|bool|
Open fire (Yes/No)|open_fire|bool|
Terrace (Yes/No)|terrace|bool|
Terrace Area|terrace_area|int|
Garden (Yes/No)|garden|bool|
Garden Area|garden_area|int|
Surface of the land|land_surface|int|
Surface area of the plot of land|land_plot_surface|int|
Number of facades|facades_number|int|
Swimming pool (Yes/No)|swimming_pool_has|bool|
State of the building|building_state|str|(New, to be renovated, ...)

## Data interpretation
TBD

# Future improvements 
TBD

# Take over
1. Excel may be an effective solution on a single table analysis but joining different tables through pandas could be more effective.
1. Task(s) must be fully clarified and agreed to avoid overlaps.
1. Teaching and self-training (code undersanding and replication) should be limited in the amount of time and effort spent during a project.

# Collecting Data (When)
- Repository: `challenge-data-analysis`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: ``4 people * 3 days ` plus out of hours working
- Deadline: `23/10/2020 17:00`
- Presentation: `26/10/2020 9:00`

## Description
Selling a home can be a lot of fun. Selling a home can be a lot of not fun as well. Often, the difference is the ability of the most interested parties (Buyer and Seller) to know what is going on, and where they stand.

As a [ERC-721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721) Non-Fungible Token contract, SmartRPA enables secure transparency for both the Homeowner (Seller) and Potential Buyers by integrating Chainlink time enforcement ([Alarm Clock](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-alarm-clock)) with the trust of blockchain and existing document management systems (e.g. DocuSign).

It's really quite simple.
1. A Seller posts their listing on-chain by deploying a SmartRPA.
2. Potential Buyers submit the URL of their offer, and the number of days the Seller has to respond.
3. Each Potential Buyers' submission returns them a unique SRPA token that's linked to their offer. They can use this to check its status.
4. Once an offer is submitted, a Chainlink Alarm Clock is started with a clause check to see if it was accepted or countered within the offer's time limit.
   - If it was not, that offer's SRPA token is [burned](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_burn-uint256-) (transfering ownership from the Potential Buyer to no one) as the offer is no longer active. 
   - If it was, a similar timer is started for the Counter Offer or for Close of Escrow and the token's offer URL becomes the SmartRPA's offer URL.

At any point, the Seller can see how many offers they have, when each expires, and securely access them through familiar standards. Listing on-chain also facilitates the use of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets as payment.

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/gumdropsteve/SmartRPA

cd SmartRPA

npm install

truffle compile

truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby -f 2

truffle run verify SmartRPA --network rinkeby --license MIT
```

### Using the Testnets
#### What is a testnet?
TLDR: building on blockchain for free.
> Since Ethereum is a protocol, this means there can be multiple independent ""[networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks)"" conforming to this protocol that do not interact with each other.
> 
> Mainnet is the primary public Ethereum production blockchain, where actual-value transactions occur on the distributed ledger.
> When people and exchanges discuss ETH prices, they're talking about mainnet ETH.
> 
>  In addition to mainnet, there are public [testnets](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/#testnets). These are networks used by protocol developers or smart contract developers to test both protocol upgrades as well as potential smart contracts in a production-like environment before deployment to mainnet. Think of this as an analog to production versus staging servers. - [Etherium docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/)

To deploy and then interact with the contract, you'll need testnet LINK and testnet ETH tokens. We used the [Rinkeby](https://www.rinkeby.io/) testnet, which means those tokens will need to come from Rinkeby faucets.

> LINK tokens are used to pay node operators for retrieving data for smart contracts and also for deposits placed by node operators as required by contract creators. - [Chainlink docs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/link-token-contracts)

All of this info is related to your wallet. Here's a 4 minute video for setting up your wallet if you don't already have one: https://youtu.be/P7FX_1PePX0

#### Ethereum (Rinkeby)
- LINK faucet: https://rinkeby.chain.link
   - Address: 0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709
- ETH faucet: https://faucet.rinkeby.io

SRPA Token address: 0x6da11450865C6cff248E29D7f64Ce285c94590dD

### Unit tests
To run the unit testing script

```
truffle test ./test/SmartRPA_test.js
```

The unit testing script will take you through each stage of the SRPA lifecycle. From initial offer creation from the buyer, to offer acceptance by the seller.

### Front end
Front end repo: https://github.com/eserilev/smart-rpa-frontend

## Long term vision
#### DAO and Revenue Generation
   - With enough utilization, small fees can be applied to Buyers or Sellers during the SRPA process. 
   - These fees can be distributed to users holding LAND tokens.
      - LAND is an ERC20 token capped at 100,000,000 LAND and minted via a set emission schedule.
      - LAND is a governance token with time-weighted voting and value accrual mechanisms.
      - LAND value is accrued through the fees collected by the SRPA process. Holders of the token can also vote lock their LAND and begin voting on various DAO proporsals.

#### Liquidity 
   - Users can provide liquidity to SmartRPA liquidty pools and accrue APY gains. APY rewards will be paid out via newly minted LAND tokens. 
   - With enough liquidity, SmartRPA may be able to begin offering collateralized loans and other financial services.

This repo contains a set of R scripts for cleaning housing data provided by RWI-GEO-RED, and for constructing hedonic price/rent indexes. 

The data cleaning steps I followed in these scripts are ad hoc and thus you may need to adapt them to your need should you find them useful. 
Somes of the steps in the scripts might not be relevant for your particular use case, for example, extracting the zip files and parsing the variable/value labels, and translating variable names. You may read the scripts in the following order. 
## Steps
1. [parse-labels_from_Stata-log-files.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/parse-labels_from_Stata-log-files.R)
2. [prepare_prices-rents_data.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/prepare_prices-rents_data.R)
3. [clean_prices.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/clean_prices.R)
4. [clean_rents.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/clean_rents.R)
5. [hedonic-model_prices.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/hedonic-model_prices.R)
6. [hedonic-model_rents.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/hedonic-model_rents.R)

## Usage

### Requirements

- `R 4.2` or higher

- Development version of data.table (v 1.14.7) or higher:

  ```r
  install.packages(""data.table"")
  
  # latest development version
  data.table::update_dev_pkg()
  ```

### Preparation

Besides installing packages, you may need to create a `.Renviron` file for the location of the RWI-GEO-RED data and the desired start and end year, for example:

```bash
RED_FOLDER=C:/Users/x/RWI-GEO-RED_v6
YEAR_START=2007
YEAR_END=2021
```
> Note: Alternatively, you can define those constants inside the respective scripts. 

**Furthermore, you need to download additional data:**

- For the CPI to work, [download the monthly CPI from Destatis](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?sequenz=statistikTabellen&selectionname=61121&language=en#abreadcrumb) (make sure to select the years you need) and save it as `extra/cpi_61121-0002.csv`

## Features

[clean_prices.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/clean_prices.R) and [clean_rents.R](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/clean_rents.R) filter and clean the data for house/apartment prices and rents respectively. Furthermore, datasets for houses and apartments are combined, 

- Filtering:
  - [for each observation which is classified as 'likely duplicate' (`dupID_gen == 1`), drop the previous one](https://github.com/eyayaw/cleaning-RWI-GEO-RED/blob/main/clean_rents.R#L15)
  - rents: only keep observations with `grid_id > 0 & rent > 0 & floor_space > 0 & num_rooms > 0 & utilities > 0`
  - prices: only keep observations with `grid_id > 0 & price > 0 & floor_space > 0 & num_rooms > 0` 

- Combining rents for apartments and houses:
  - assign code `999L` to object properties that only apply to the other category (apartments/houses)

- Cleaning:
  - missing values (with FDZ codes < 0) are recoded to ""na""
  - `num_bedrooms`: limited between 1 and 7 bedrooms (`>=7` recoded to `7+`), missing recoded to ""na or 0""
  - `num_bathrooms`, `num_floors`: limited between 1 and 4 (rest see `num_bedrooms`)

Additional processing at the end of `clean_rents.R`:

- construction/renovation year
  - construction year <-> renovation year in case the other one is NA
  - drop construction years below 1900
    - if NA, impute construction year and drop imputations < 1900
- discard properties with
  - (i) a monthly rental price below 1e/m2 or above 50e/m2
  - (ii) floor space below 30m2 or above 500m2
  
And finally:

- the distance to the central business district (CBD) is computed and
- the consumer price index (CPI) is used to adjust rents/prices for inflation

### Open issues

- kategorie_Wohnung has label value ""11"" that has no label (neither Stata nor csv, in the csv the label is ""11"")

## A note on constructing a hedonic index

The data come with a rich set of property characteristics which enable us to compute a hedonic (price) index to quality-adjust house prices. I construct a mix-adjusted house price index from the following panel hedonic regression

$$
\ln P_{hit} = \textbf X_{hit}\boldsymbol\beta + \delta_{it} + \varepsilon_{hit}, \quad \quad \quad \quad (1)
$$

where $h$ indexes houses, $i$ districts and $t$ years, $P$ is the price of houses in euros per $m^2$, $\delta_{it}$ denotes district-year fixed effects that are of main interest to estimate, and $\textbf{X}$ includes a set of house characteristics. The estimated intercepts $\widehat{\delta_{it}}$ represent the quality adjusted prices for each district $i$ in every year $t$. After estimating (1) with fixed effects, the **log hedonic price index** per $m^2$ is given by $\widehat{\delta_{it}} = \ln P_{hit} ‚àí \textbf{X}_{hit}\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$. House prices are adjusted for inflation using the German [consumer price index (CPI)](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?sequenz=statistikTabellen&selectionname=61121&language=en#abreadcrumb).

Additionally, in the `extra/` folder, labor market regions ([Kosfeld and Werner (2012)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13147-011-0137-8 ""German Labour Markets‚ÄîNew Delineation after the Reforms of German District Boundaries 2007‚Äì2011"")), the (1kmx1km) grid, municipality, and district information for Germany are provided. Note that the Kosfeld and Werner (2012)'s labor market regions are updated for the 2019 (end of the year) administrative structure ([Verwaltungsgliederung am 31.12.2019](https://www.destatis.de/DE/Themen/Laender-Regionen/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/Administrativ/Archiv/Verwaltungsgliederung/31122019_Jahr.html)) of districts.

Made in partnership with @emgerber88","# Recommending ZIP Codes to a Family Moving to King County, WA

## Overview

Tasked with creating a predictive model for home prices in King County, Washington, we elected to focus our model on predicting prices with the goal of helping families that earn roughly the median income for a household in Seattle (~$100,000 per year) buy a home that is in their price range and in an area with good schools. 

We used housing sale data from the King County House Sales dataset, student test score data from Washington State's open data portal, and school address information from the Washington school directory to build our model. We tried a variety of approaches in building our model, including log transformations, RFE, and others. Using the strongest of these (r-squared of .71) we created predicted home sale prices for the dataset and compared those predictions to actual sale prices to determine in which zip codes homes are selling for less than we expect, and in which zip codes schools are better than average. 

Based on these factors, we recommend that families look to purchase housing in the 98004 zip code, which is in Bellevue, WA (10 minutes outside of Seattle by car).

## Business Problem

The Agrawal-Gerber Realty Firm assists families moving to King County, Washington in finding a market-rate home in an area with good schools for their kids. To inform our recommendations, we have created a model to predict the price of homes in King County (which comprises Seattle, Bellevue, Kent, and several other small- to mid-sized cities and towns). 

Housing in King County is very expensive (the median home in the dataset of sales county sold for $860,000), so families need to know that their investment represents a good value before they commit to buying a home.

By measuring our predictions against records of actual home sales from 2021 to 2022, we can recommend areas where we believe homes are selling for less than their true value - thus providing families with the ability to buy a home at a good price before the housing market catches up.

## Data Understanding

We used information from three datasets to build our model, all of which are saved in the data folder of our repository:
- Housing sale data from the [King County House Sales dataset](data/kc_house_data.csv), which includes the target variable for our models (price) and a wide range of continuous, discrete, and categorical predictor variables, such as zip code, square feet of living space, number of bedrooms, and more.
- Student test score data from [Washington State's open data portal](https://data.wa.gov/education/Report-Card-Assessment-Data-2021-22-School-Year/v928-8kke), which we used to build a composite measure of average school quality by zip code to use as a predictor for our model.
- School address information from the [Washington school directory](https://eds.ospi.k12.wa.us/directoryeds.aspx) to build our model, which we used to match schools to zip codes in the King County House Sales dataset.

We began with some exploratory data analysis which revealed a relationship between square feet of living space and price:

![heatmap](Images/heatmap.png)
![basic_linear_regression](Images/sqftliving_price_scatter.png)

It also revealed that the price of homes in the county has a significant right skew that we would need to account for in later modeling.

![prices](Images/prices_hist.png)

We used a single variable - square feet of living space - to construct our baseline model and iterated from there. We performed only cursory data cleaning before running our baseline; for example, we located and removed a record of a home that was incorrectly listed as being only 3 sq. ft. large, and we removed records for homes that were not located in King County by extracting ZIP code from the home address and matching it to a list maintained by the county.

## Modeling and Regression Results
### Model 1: Baseline model

We split our data into train and test sets and used the train set to iterate on our model.

The baseline model with train data had an adjusted r-squared of .393, and a mean absolute error of over $270,000. From there, we decided to process our data to incorporate more predictor variables and include the accuracy of our model.

### Data cleaning and processing

Because our clients are interested in school quality, we used data from Washington State's open data portal to develop a composite ZIP-code-level school quality rating using student test scores on standardized tests. We matched schools to ZIP codes using data from the Washington school directory. Then, we demonstrated that there is a simple relationship between average school quality for a ZIP code and average home price for a ZIP code using a scatterplot.

![prices](Images/schoolquality_price_scatter.png)

Having created and validated this metric, we moved on to processing our categorical variables. We created an ordinal scale for variables such as ""view"", ""condition"", and ""grade""; created a boolean column to differentiate homes that had been renovated vs. homes that had not by using the values in the 'yr_renovated' column; and created dummy variables for nominal variables such as waterfront, greenbelt, and nuisance so that we could see the impact they have on home price. We also dropped unnecessary columns from our data.

### Model 2: All Variable Model
When we ran our ""all variable model"" on our train data, we found that this model performed substantially better. The model is statistically significant, and our adjusted r-squared increased from 39% to 53.8%, which indicates that the model explains the variance in price about 15 percentage points better than the simple model did. But we recognized that there was still significant room for improvement.

### Transforming variables
We saw that some of our predictor variables (such as square feet of living space, square feet of space above ground, and years old) and our outcome variable had a rightward skew so we used a log transformation to normalize their distribution. You can see that compared to the distribution above, this data appears to have a more normal distribution.

![log_prices](Images/log_prices_hist.png)

We used these transformed variables, as well as the other non-transformed variables from our All Variable Model, to run our third model.

### Model 3: Log-transformed Model
This model didn't change much from the all-variable model. The model is still statistically significant, but our adjusted r-squared barely changed (.538 to .541) - suggesting that this model does not explain more variance in our outcome than did the previous model.

However, there is still one major place for improvements - we need to treat ZIP codes as the categorical variable they are, and not as a continuous numeric variable.

### 'Final' Model: One-Hot Encoded Zip Codes
Up to this point our model was treating ZIP codes as a numerical variable, but in reality they are a categorical variable. We needed to one-hot encode them to include them properly in our model.

We created dummy variables for each ZIP code, with 98021 as our reference.

Our model showed a significant jump in performance as a result of this change, reaching an adjusted r-squared of .707 on our train data.

### Validating the final model against test data
We tested our final model against previously unused test data by transforming that data using the same steps as we used in transforming our previous models, and got an adjusted r-squared of .687. This value was close enough to that for our train data that we felt comfortable moving forward with our analysis.

## Answering Our Business Question
After validating our model, we ran the full dataset through it to predict the value of each listing and compare it to the observed sale price to calculate our residuals. Our goal was to find a ZIP code where the average difference between the residual values were negative on average, which would indicate that our model thinks those homes sold for less than they ""should"" have. We also added information on school quality for each ZIP code to this dataset and standardized it so that we could determine which ZIP codes have homes that are a good value and have above average schools.

![schools_vs_prices](Images/schoolquality_price_recs.png)

Based on this analysis, we recommend that families begin their home search in one of three ZIP codes: 98004 (Bellevue), 98040 (Mercer Island), and 98033 (Kirkland).

![map](Images/map.png)

## Conclusions
Ultimately, we recommend that families begin their home search in one of three ZIP codes: 98004 (Bellevue), 98040 (Mercer Island), and 98033 (Kirkland). These areas have homes that our model suggests are undervalued (meaning they are a good investment), and have schools that are above average in terms of student performance on state tests.

Some limitations of our model: 
- We achieved an r-squared of around .7, but that still means that roughly 30% of the variation in price cannot be explained by our model.
- The model has some issues with multicollinearity and satisfying the other assumptions of linear regression.
- We don't have any information on housing types (i.e. single family vs. multifamily, standalone vs. condo, etc.) that may be important predictors of home value in our model.

In the future, we could improve and expand this model by:
- Incorporating additional data on school quality.
- Gathering more data from past home sales and future home sales to increase the size of our dataset and examine sales trends over time.
- Finding additional predictor variables such as home type and incorporating them into our model.

# üè†HouseNet
HouseNet is my latest Android project, of the Mobile Application Development course, held in the third semester of Technische Hochschule Ulm. It was an OPTIONAL project and it was rated with 11/12 points by Prof. Philip Graf.

## üí°Main Functionality 
The general purpose of the project is an Android application, which gives the opportunity to the user to see all available listed real estate properties.     Additionally, filter them out (search) by their property type and city, in which they are located.

## üì≤Other Functionalities
Another feature is to see more details about each individual property, for example, its description, price, picture, location, and telephone number for contact.

For better UX there exists a functionality to save and store individual properties into a list and display them to another ""Favorites"" view page.

Finally, there is a built-in error handling (in case of network error for example, or if no search results are found)

## Description

Property is a marginal investment, it tracks inflation over the long term.  We're in the midst of another round of property euphoria, the painful lessons of 2008 apparently completely forgotten.  This book provides a rational analysis of the returns an investor can expect in the property market.  

The method is simple, combine carefully chosen acquisitions with thoughtful management and leverage.  The goal should be ROE, not cash flow.  If you're lucky enough to encounter a rising market and low interest rates you'll do better.  This high level analysis is supported by real life examples from 2012 to present, including detailed cost analysis of actual rental properties.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I have a scraper that currently scrapes sites for housing data around the GTA (Greater Toronto Area). The format of the data is in csv and JSON, and the frequency of scrapes is once per day at around 5pm noon EST. The information currently includes the address, price and misc. details about the property. Data can be found in the data file, and named in `mmddyyyy` format. Feel free to use this data to your liking.

## Introduction

...

## Quick Start

...

## Contract

The contract assumes a rental amount and total payments needed for ownership. It only allows the tenant to make payments, which must be the exact amount of the rent. Each payment is counted and stored in the global and local state of the contract. If the payment count reaches the total needed for ownership, the contract will mark the property as owned.

It's important to note that this contract is quite simplified compared to the Solidity version. Due to the differences in contract structure between Ethereum and Algorand, not all the functionality of the Solidity contract can be replicated in PyTeal. In particular, handling overpayments or adjusting the rental amount would need to be handled off-chain. Additionally, for more complex functionalities and interactions with other contracts, Algorand offers Atomic Transfers and Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs).

As with the Solidity version, this is a basic model and doesn't cover all possible edge cases or legal requirements. It's recommended to consult with a legal and financial advisor when creating real-world contracts.

## Objective
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The objective of this project is to predict the future selling prices of houses for a real estate app. Static historical data was gathered from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), on past house sales, including the number of `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `house_size` and `state` or United States territory, along with the final selling price. 


By integrating multiple machine learning models in conjunction with Conformal prediction analysis, the app evaluates the ML performance against scoring metrics, to provide the user with model `price_predictions` future values and then evaluates via conformal analysis to inform the user whether the prediced future price has over 95% confidence level or not.



## Conformal prediction analysis
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)


**What is Conformal Prediction Analysis?**

[Conformal prediction analysis](https://medium.com/low-code-for-advanced-data-science/conformal-prediction-theory-explained-14a35226df80) is a machine learning framework that provides a way to assign confidence levels to individual predictions, in our case - real-estate future prices, based on a given level of significance.


**How is Conformal Prediction Analysis used in this repo?**

By using multiple regression models & scoring metrics via the [`lazypredict`](https://pypi.org/project/lazypredict/) python package, we first selected the top ML models results that were ranked based on their performance against `R^2` & `RMSE` scoring metrics, from `lazypredict` analysis.


After top ML model selection(s), the `nonconformist` python package assigned a confidence level to each prediction based on the error rate and the desired level of significance (95%).

By selecting the model with the highest confidence level for each prediction, we were able to provide price predictions and then assess those predictions against the 95% price prediction confidence level.

- Initial data capture - better, more robust data sets, time series data, paid APIs.
- Include attributes like `sq_ft`, `price_per_sq_ft`, `address`, `date_sold`, etc.
- Use enhanced conformal prediction to find the best ranked sore for price predictions.
- `Blockchain` implementation: By recording real estate data on a blockchain, we can create a transparent and immutable record of real estate transactions to prevent fraud and corruption, as all transactions are publicly visible and immutable or can't be altered.
- Rental predictions based on `bed`, `bath` and `sq_ft`.
- Real-estate portfolio creation and management for investors.

Heatmap :  

![heatmap](assets/images/heatmap.png)
## Data preprocessing

Some features needed to be transformed to be able to train and test our model with it. 
Here are the said transformation and the respective library used:

- One-Hot encoding the categorical columns => [One-Hot Encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)
- Scaling the numerical columns and the encoded categorical columns => [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)
- Handle the missing data in the dataset => [SimpleImputer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html)
- Separating the data between the train and the test set => [train_test_split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html?highlight=train_test_split#sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split)

The preprocessing steps described above were carried through two separate pipelines. A numerical_pipeline for the numerical columns and a categorical_pipeline for the categorical values. 
I used the convenient [make_pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.make_pipeline.html) and [make_column_transformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.make_column_transformer.html) from Scikit-Learn to configure those pipelines.


## Determining a baseline for the model

In this step I calculated what the results of a prediction model would be if we only guessed at property prices. 
The purpose of this is to have a basis for better understanding the results of our future model.
I used the [DummyClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier.html).

#### The baseline for our model

- Mean squared error : 159931446339.08014
- Mean absolute error : 173117.60024260395
- Explained variance score : 0.0
- r2 score : -0.10401510078632081


## Model selection

Trough multiple steps of trials I tested multiples models and configuration. 
The that gave me the best results was Xgboost with a BaggingRegressor.
[BaggingRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingRegressor.html)
[Xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html)

## Model training
The full dataset was split with a proportion of 0.8 for the training dataset.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
I used [GridSearch](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) to find the best hyperparameters.

## Model Evaluation
Here are the results of the model against the testing data : 

- Mean squared error : 31022727615.411995
- Mean absolute error : 86094.01882551557
- Explained variance score : 0.7577142613146228
- r2 score : 0.7574321295725

## Results interpretation

When estimating the price of something I think the main indicator to take into consideration is the MAE (Mean Absolute Error).  

*Why the MAE instead of the MSE?*  

Because it will give us on average the difference between our predicted price and the target price.
Moreover, it is much easier to interpret it in the scale of our real data. 
Another argument is that the size of an error is linear with its magnitude. 
In view of these points, it is more logical to rely on the MAE.   
It can be observed that the MAE have decreased significantly, its almost halved.  

On average there is a 80 000 euros difference between the price estimated by the model and the actual price. 
In reflexion to the prices available on the belgian market its still quite a high difference. 

## Possible improvements
As the data cleaning and hyperparameter tuning has already been done in depth, I think the main focus should be on adding new features.  

For example we could add the median price of the locality for each property. This information could be calculated by hand with the data already obtained but this could be dangerous. 
*Why? because the number of properties listed for sale per locality varies greatly. Let's say we compare 2 communes, commune A and commune B. 
In commune A there are 300 houses for sale while in commune B there is only one. The median price of commune A would be representative of the commune prices but the median price of commune B would be the exact price of the one property listed for sale in the commune.  

To remedy this we could incorporate the median prices per locality listed on [StatBel](https://statbel.fgov.be/en)
To go even deeper into the information available for each property, one could retrieve information on the neighbourhood in which the property is located. Here are some questions that could be interesting and determining in the price of a house or a flat.

*How far away is the nearest public transport?*  

*How far is it to the schools?*  

*How far is it to the nearest supermarket?*  

*How long does it take for the emergency services to get to the house?*  


## User Interface/Web app
The user interface has been programmed with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). And can be found [here](https://share.streamlit.io/pierrekimbanzir/belgium_housing_price_predictor/main/app.py).

## Local setup

### Local environment

First of all, you need to install poetry. To do that, run

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (\$HOME/.poetry/bin) in your `PATH`
environment variable. Next time you log in this will be done
automatically.

To configure your current shell run `source $HOME/.poetry/env`

This project uses `black` as the code formatter and `flake8` as the linter.
To add git-hooks on your enviroment, so you can run `black` and `flake8` on your project for every commit, please execute `pre-commit install`.

Also, you need to configurate the enviroment variables accordingly. Create `env` file in the project's root folder and set the variables following the `.env.example`.

In order to have the poetry packages in a local virtual environment (in the project root directory), run:

```bash
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
make install
```

If you don't wanna a local virtual env, just run `make install` alone.

### Development

You can always use Docker (recommended) to get those things isolated, in a container.
To create and start the container running on background, execute:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

To run the migrations, execute the command:

```bash
docker-compose exec flasky make migrate
```

Check the running application on your browser with the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1` url.

This project uses `flasgger` and you can access the API documentation on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/apidocs`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

We strive to equip them with the tools, resources, and platforms necessary to explore, challenge, and reshape existing norms and practices in architecture and housing.

3.2.2 Establishing the Meta-Estate Lab: We aim to establish and support the Meta-Estate Lab, a pioneering initiative designed to challenge and reinvent existing architectural and housing practices.

üìÅ Real Estate Broker Application<br/>



## Overview

- In the present scenario due to Covid-19, one of the industry that has struggled to accept digital innovation is the traditionally paper-driven real estate industry. For instance, in India, it‚Äôs hard to find a well-functioning real estate platform that will satisfy the needs of both property owners and buyers. 

- There are some popular websites, but they don‚Äôt work properly. Listings only work if they‚Äôre posted by brokers. The service is free of charge for owners, but quite costly for buyers. Consequently, buyers lose money. So do owners, who could have sold their property at a higher price instead of paying a commission to somebody else. 

- Also, the existing platforms don‚Äôt provide property valuations. Owners don‚Äôt know how much their property actually costs, and have to accept the broker‚Äôs price. In turn, brokers tend to suggest more customer-friendly prices so the properties will sell faster. This problem was elegantly solved by Scoperty ‚Äì a service that connects owners, buyers and realtors, and provides up-to-date valuations.

#### The proposed system can be elegantly solved by "" Name Of the Application "" ‚Äì a service that connects owners, buyers and realtors, and provides up-to-date valuations.

## Setup

- Clone the repo and cd into the directory


```sh
$ git clone ""https://github.com/snjydas/Real Estate Broker Application""
$ cd Real-Estate-Broker-Application
```

## Run


## Output

<p align=""center"">

</p>

## Features

- Broker can add/update/delete properties.
- Customers can see the list of properties available for buying/renting based on various criterias.
- Customers can buy/rent a property listed by Broker.
- Once bought/rented property is no longer available for others.
- Customers can also see the properties he owned or rented.

<h2> Overview </h2>
The **RealWorld Data Analytics Platform (rDAP)** is a data services framework that utilizes modern application development practices to deliver advanced real estate data to a core data mart which overlaps GIS sources with data from government agencies, Realestate websites, and public records. 

<h2> What's the ""Big Idea""? </h2>
The ""BIG"" idea is to develop a data source containg layered collections of Geographic Information [(GIS)](https://github.com/sshuair/awesome-gis) data with other public records (i.e. [county appraiser](https://downloads.hcpafl.org) , or [clerk of court](https://www.hillsclerk.com/Additional-Services/Official-Records), etc) so that devs, BI guys, and data scienctists can do their magic! <br/>
All contributers must work to **improve** and/or **automate** most of these proccesses:
<br/>

- Gather source data üìù 
- Map data elements from source üó∫Ô∏è 
- Buid flexible code for reusability ‚ôªÔ∏èüìú 
- Incorporate Test (automated?) scripts at key steps üîç
- Develop with End User in mind ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Ask questions and collaborate üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë


<h2> But Why, tho? </h2><br/>
Purchasing a home, for most people, is the single largest financial decision of their life. Sadly, real estate ""buyers"" make their decisions based only on the **LIMITED** data exposed to them from simple search filters or after an open house. And even for ""buyers"" who want to do **thorough** research, the data points they want are often isolated and require experience with APIs, Databases, Webs Scraping, or ETL/ELT to extract it. However, I believe truely suffecient data should be easyily accessible and curated into one platform for all ""buyers"" in order to make a more informed purchasing decision.<br/><br/>


<h2> Who can Contribute and How </h2>
There are many types of ""contributers"" needed for this project, including those with experience as:<br/>

- **Home Buyers** ‚û°Ô∏è primary end users of the data who will help guide our requirments & provide feedback loops
- **Bloggers** ‚û°Ô∏è aka messenger birds - discuss our project vision thus attracting more users/contributers
- **Architects** ‚û°Ô∏è advise, build, and/or maintain architecture for developers (also create archetecture documents)
- **Data Engineers/Developers** ‚û°Ô∏è create scipts, databases, pipelines, tech docs including: data flow diagrams, erds, source data dictionaries, etc
- **Data Scientists** ‚û°Ô∏è analyze, process, and model data within the datamart & much more
- **Consultants** ‚û°Ô∏è data conultants can be helpful for discussing best practices, improvements, and general advice
- **Others** ‚û°Ô∏è really anyone who has interest, input, or feedback is welcome to join project discussions

- How likely am I to find a similar offer, and how long would it take?

It's easy and intuitive! Visit the webpage and try it out: [WG-prices](https://wgs-in-germany.streamlit.app/)


## Why do we need WG-prices?
The price paid for a WG is somewhat related to the rental price of the flat. However, the WG market in Germany is saturated in several cities, making people living in WGs susceptible to accept WGs that charge more than they should. This is the case specially for younger adults and people coming from abroad that have little resources and knowledge to judge the fairness of an offer.

WG-prices is 100% free of charge for everyone. If you live or wants to live in a WG, WG-prices helps you judge if the values charged are in accordance to the current market, or if someone is trying to exploit you.


## How to use it?
Open the [link](https://wgs-in-germany.streamlit.app/) and select one of the tabs.
- If you already have an ad from wg-gesucht.de that you would like to investigate, open the tab ""Analyse WG from url link"", paste the link to the wg-gesucht ad and click ""submit"";
- If you would like to compare your own flat to the current market, open the tab ""Analyse my own WG"", insert the information about your WG and click ""submit"". Information submitted is only used for your analysis and is not saved anywhere;
- If you are instead only interested in a global overview of the current market, select the tab ""Overview of the WG market"", select the parameters of your choice and click ""Show results"";
- If you are interested in the predictive model of prices, select the tab ""The predictive model of WG prices"".


## Behind the curtains
Inside WG-prices I developed a webcrawler tool to collect data from wg-gesucht.de. This tool has been constantly running since August 2022 and I accumulated over 100.000 ads for WGs, single-room, multi-room flats and houses. [WG-prices](https://wgs-in-germany.streamlit.app/) is a platform for anyone to access all of this data without any coding knowledge.

Particularly, I used these data to generate a predictive model of prices. Please check the [wg_price_predictor](https://github.com/chvieira2/wg_price_predictor) repository if you are interested in the predictive model. This model is used to answer a simple question: **given the current market, how much should be charged for a WG with given specifications**. As the model is not perfect, the full analysis of the current market in the past 3 months in Germany is displayed in a dashboard format to help you form your own judgement.


## Finding similar offers
Another important use of this data is to identify similar offers. For that, I collect information on the room of interest (either an ad on wg-gesucht.de or your own) and compare it to the database of ads. Recently published, similar ads are found by identifying offers with similar price and at proximal similar locations. If less than 3 similar ads are found, I extend the search to the days before.


## How to use my webcrawler in your own project
If you are interested in using this webcrawler for your own project, please:
1) Download this repository.
2) In your terminal, go the project folder you just downloaded.
3) If you would like to use it as a module in your own code, install it by running run ""pip install -e .""
4) If you just want to run my code directly for a city of interest, simply run ""python main.py -l name_city"".

For an example on how this crawler could be used in your own project, please see [Livablestreets](https://github.com/chvieira2/livablestreets).

## Advantages of Decenralizing Real Estate
 
‚Ä¢ Increased Transparency: Using blockchain technology can increase transparency and reduce the likelihood of fraud or disputes. This is because all the transactions and ownership details would be stored on a decentralized ledger, making it easier to verify the authenticity of the asset and its ownership.

‚Ä¢ Liquidity: NFTs can make it easier to buy and sell real estate assets because they can be fractionalized, meaning that they can be broken down into smaller portions, allowing more people to invest in them. This could potentially make real estate investment more accessible to a wider range of investors.

‚Ä¢ Speed: Traditional real estate transactions can be slow and require a lot of paperwork. Using NFTs on the blockchain could speed up the process by making it easier to transfer ownership of the asset.

‚Ä¢ Flowty Integration

# Why we chose Flow to build the decentralized real estate platform FlowEstate
We found out Flow blockchain as a most suitable choice for building a real estate platform because of its scalability, high throughput, and ability to handle complex smart contracts.

Real estate platforms require high-speed transactions, data storage, and secure contracts to manage real estate transactions, such as buying and selling properties, rental agreements, and property management. Flow blockchain can provide fast and reliable transaction processing and storage, which can help to minimize the time and costs involved in real estate transactions.

Additionally, Flow's ability to support smart contracts can enable developers to create decentralized applications that can automate the processes involved in real estate transactions, such as escrow payments, title transfers, and property ownership verification. This can help to reduce the need for intermediaries and improve the efficiency and transparency of the real estate market.

Overall, Flow blockchain can provide a suitable foundation for building a secure and scalable real estate platform that can streamline the process of buying, selling, and managing real estate properties. 

## When selecting real estate properties to represent as NFTs, we are considering the following factors:

‚Ä¢ Location: Properties in prime locations with high demand are more likely to attract buyers, so it's a good idea to choose properties that are in popular areas.

‚Ä¢ Type of Property: Different types of properties have varying demand and appeal. For instance, residential properties such as apartments or houses, commercial properties like offices, retail shops, or industrial warehouses, or even land.

‚Ä¢ Condition: The condition of the property is also an essential factor to consider. A property that is in good condition and has been well-maintained is likely to have a higher value.

¬∞ Historical Significance: Properties that have historical or cultural significance might have more value and could potentially attract a broader audience.

¬∞ Market Value: The market value of the property is an important factor to consider when selecting properties to represent as NFTs. The value of the property should be high enough to make it an attractive investment for buyers.

**Welcome to the Decentralized Land Registry project, an open-source venture that aims to redefine land transactions with the power of blockchain. Leveraging advanced blockchain technology, this project introduces an innovative way to manage and conduct land transactions transparently, securely, and efficiently.**

## Introduction

The traditional land registry systems are often fraught with inefficiencies, potential for fraud, and lack of transparency. Our solution, a blockchain-based land registry, addresses these issues head-on by providing an immutable and public record of land transactions, drastically reducing the potential for fraud and manipulation. By combining cryptography and consensus algorithms, blockchain technology ensures that once data is added to the blockchain, it is virtually impossible to change.

This is an example of  a smart contract for a land registry system where an owner can register their land, update the land details, and even transfer ownership in a secure way. This contract makes land transactions more transparent and trustworthy.

The primary functionalities include:

1. Registration: When a user first registers a parcel of land, they are recorded as the owner of that parcel in the global state of the smart contract.

2. Land Update: The owner can update the details of their registered land. Any updates are recorded in the global state, ensuring that a history of changes is kept.

3. Ownership Transfer: If the owner decides to transfer their land, the contract allows for a seamless and secure transfer of ownership.

This Decentralized Land Registry project is set to revolutionize how we view land transactions, bringing about a new level of transparency and security. We're excited to embark on this journey towards a more efficient, reliable, and secure system for land transactions, and we warmly invite you to explore, contribute, and grow with us in this endeavor.

## Quick Start

...

## Contract

This PyTeal code defines a basic smart contract for a land registry. The contract allows an ""owner"" (the account that created the contract) to update a ""land"" global variable. Any other account that tries to call the contract will have their transaction rejected.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all potential security vulnerabilities or complex needs of a real-world land registry system. The contract code should be audited by a professional before being used in a production environment.

- This ccontract has a `transfer_ownership` function that allows the owner to transfer ownership of the land to a new owner.
- The owner can call the contract with the first argument as `update_land`, followed by the new land details as the second argument, and the landID as the third argument to update land information.
- The owner can also call the contract with the first argument as `transfer_ownership`, followed by the new owner's address as the second argument to transfer the ownership.
- Non-owner transactions are still rejected.

## Introduction

Blockchain Autonomous Building Management!

Welcome to our revolutionary project - an autonomous building management system built on the Blockchain. The project integrates a unique blend of real estate management and blockchain technology, creating an ecosystem where a building can effectively ""own"" itself. This concept is a stepping stone to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and a significant leap forward for blockchain applications in real estate.

Our autonomous building management system employs smart contracts to manage and oversee a building's fundamental operational aspects, including rent collection, maintenance costs, and ownership transfers. The smart contracts, which are blockchain's primary building blocks, are immutable, transparent, and verifiable pieces of code that automatically execute transactions when predefined conditions are met.

In the context of our project, these smart contracts come to life as entities managing a building. They collect rent from tenants, pay maintenance costs, and can even transfer ownership when the building is bought. We implement penalty mechanisms for late payments, ensuring all stakeholders are held accountable.

This system can have profound implications for reducing administrative overhead, increasing efficiency, and fostering a new level of transparency in the real estate sector.

Please note, this project showcases the potential of blockchain technology. As with any significant technology implementation, thorough testing is required before actual use. Blockchain and smart contract technology is complex, and mistakes can lead to severe consequences, including loss of funds. Always consult with experts when interacting with such systems.

## Quick Start

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> Compile

``` sh
npm run compile
```

## Contract

This is an example of a Solidity smart contract that represents a building that owns itself. This contract can be used to manage funds, pay for maintenance, collect rent, and sell ownership.

This contract should be deployed by sending a transaction with enough value to cover the initial price, rent, and maintenance costs. The contract includes a timestamp for the last rent payment and the last maintenance payment, and it checks that the payments are not overdue before transferring ownership or withdrawing funds. The contract also requires an extra fee for late payments.

It includes functionalities to:

- Introduce a mechanism to penalize or evict tenants if they do not pay rent.
- Prevent the building from falling into disrepair if the maintenance costs are not paid.
- Handle outstanding rent payments or maintenance costs before the building can be sold.

*Please note that this is still a simplified model, and real-world applications would require additional functionality and security measures. Also, the contract should be thoroughly tested before it's used in production. Always consult with a knowledgeable expert in blockchain and smart contract technology before deploying or interacting with smart contracts.*

**Welcome to Block Foundation's Decentralized Land Registry project as part of our Smart Contract Series. It leverages the full potential of smart contracts to deliver a secure and transparent system for land transactions.**

## Introduction

Land registries have long been known for their lack of transparency and the potential for fraud, with numerous cases of illegal land acquisition and property disputes marring their history [^1]. Our solution, a Decentralized Land Registry, built on the foundation of blockchain technology, addresses these issues by providing a public, transparent, and immutable record of land transactions.

With our smart contract for the land registry system, an owner can register their land, update the land details, and even transfer ownership in a seamless and secure manner. Not only does this bring about a new level of trust and reliability to land transactions, but it also significantly reduces the potential for fraudulent activities.

This smart contract for a land registry system in which land transactions are more transparent and trustworthy, and allows an owner to register their land, update the land details, and  transfer ownership in a secure way.

The primary functionalities include:

1. Registration: When a user first registers a parcel of land, they are recorded as the owner of that parcel in the global state of the smart contract.

2. Land Update: The owner can update the details of their registered land. Any updates are recorded in the global state, ensuring that a history of changes is kept.

3. Ownership Transfer: If the owner decides to transfer their land, the contract allows for a seamless and secure transfer of ownership.

## Quick Start

Before you dive in, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can then proceed to install the necessary dependencies:

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> To compile the smart contract:

``` sh
npm run compile
```

## Contract

This is a simple implementation and can be expanded to include more complex features, like adding permissions to prevent unauthorized people from registering or transferring land.

### Class Overview

``` mermaid
classDiagram 

    class LandRegistry {
        -Land lands
        +registerLand(string, string, uint256)
        +transferLand(address, string)
        +sellLand(address, string)
        +verifyLand(string)
    }

    class Land {
        -address owner
        -string location
        -string parcelID
        -uint256 price
    }


    LandRegistry ""1"" -- ""*"" Land: has

    note for LandRegistry ""can register\ncan transfer\ncan sell\ncan verify""
    note for Land ""can be owned\nhas a location\nhas a name\nhas a price""


```

```

- `registerLand()` allows an address to register a new parcel of land with its location and a unique parcel ID. Emits a `LandRegistered` event when land is registered.
- `transferLand()` allows the current owner of a land parcel to transfer it to a new owner. Emits a `LandTransferred` event when land is transferred.
- `sellLand()` allows a landowner to sell their land to a buyer. This also involves the transfer of Ether (the currency on Ethereum) from the buyer to the seller, representing the payment for the land.
- `verifyLand()` allows anyone to verify the details of a land parcel.
- `listLandsByOwner()` allows for querying all land parcels owned by a specific `address`, making it easier to get an overview of one's properties

Moreover:

- `price` on the `Land struct` handles selling land parcels.
- `onlyLandOwner` modifier to ensures that only the owner of a land parcel can perform certain actions.

*There is also a [PyTeal version](https://github.com/block-foundation/teal-land-registry) of this smart-contract, which offers similar functionality for the Algorand blockchain.*

## Background

### Evolving Land Management Systems

As we move deeper into the 21st century, traditional methods of managing land registries have proven to be insufficient, vulnerable to fraud, and fraught with red tape. In response, our project introduces a pioneering vision for the future of land management ‚Äì the Decentralized Land Registry. By marrying the infallible security of blockchain with the expansive realm of property management, we're reshaping how property transactions are executed and recorded. This transformative project strives to make property transactions as seamless and as transparent as possible, thereby fortifying trust among parties involved.

### Incorporating Advanced Technologies

Our Decentralized Land Registry project employs advanced technologies, such as Ethereum's blockchain and Solidity, to craft a robust and secure framework for land transactions. The project is part of our Smart Contract Series that aims to demonstrate how blockchain can revolutionize various sectors and industries. The contract allows landowners to register land parcels, update details, and transfer ownership in a tamper-proof, transparent, and efficient manner.

### A Step towards Greater Transparency

Transparency is the cornerstone of any trusted system. Our project ensures complete transparency in land transactions, thereby minimizing disputes and fraudulent activities. By recording transactions on the blockchain, we provide a public and immutable ledger, thus instilling a greater level of confidence in the process. As a result, the Decentralized Land Registry is set to change the way we perceive land transactions, ushering in a new era of trust, transparency, and efficiency.

### Open Source and Community Oriented

As an open-source project, the Decentralized Land Registry encourages community participation and contribution. We believe that the combined efforts and creativity of the global developer community can accelerate the evolution of our project and bring innovative solutions to the fore. We warmly welcome developers worldwide to join our mission, contribute to our codebase, and help us build a more transparent, efficient, and secure system for land transactions.

### Code of Conduct

Read our Code of Conduct [here](https://github.com/westonwatson/realtag/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Notes
* If you don't already use an autoloader and don't require the classes manually, the RealTag PHP Client will attempt to use Composer's Autoloader. So, if you're not using this library via Composer, make sure you include both the Client class and the Helper Class manually (`require`, `require_once`).
* You can request any attribute of the API response, realtag will lookup the requested property in all API Response Sections (ie- Property, EstimatedData, Forclosure, etc).
* The client library will trigger a PHP `E_USER_NOTICE` if something isn't configured correctly or an invalid property attribute is requested.
* The PHP RealTag Client defaults to Production Mode `$devMode == false`. Make sure to enable `$devMode` if you don't want to hit the production service.
* If you have any questions or comments, feel free to open a Github Issue, or submit a pull request with your proposed changes. Any/All Help is greatly appreciated! üòÉ

A real estate app called Estatio is created using the Rapid API, Next JS, and Chakra UI. With this, you can search or filter content according to your needs. Check out the relevant Properties Info.

[Demo](https://estatio-app.vercel.app/)


## Getting Started

First, setup the .env file and get your api key from Rapid API:

```
RAPID_API_HOST=YOUR_API_KEY
RAPID_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

**spark** is a projected portfolio application that aims to help those interested in FI/RE (Financial independence, retire early). 

Default functionality includes the ability to predict portfolio value over time based on a few key variables such as net income, percentage of net income saved, and time horizon to retirement. Advanced functionality allows users to modify default assumptions on portfolio returns (10% for S&P500 average returns), yearly inflation (3% based on a conservative YoY inflation rate.), and yearly raise percentage (3% based on national averages). 

spark has the functionality to add and remove assets from your portfolio using simple variables that are standard to most asset investors; whether it is real estate, motor vehicles, or gold, spark can project the asset's performance over time and how it may influence the user's retirement plans. 

The frontend is developed using **React**, **Chart.js**, **Semantic UI**, along with some homemade CSS to tune things for the components not covered by SUI. Spark uses Firebase **Firestore** as its NoSQL database for storing user details, asset characteristics, and handling authentication/login. 

Future additions: 'how it works' explaining the method of projection, refactoring large functions -> smaller, maintainable functions

## Matching Rules
Out of 100% match, the division of weightage is as follows:
* distance: 30%
* budget: 30%
* bedroom: 20%
* bathroom: 20%

A successful match is one which has a total match of more than 40%

Requirements for distance match:
* distance should me within 10 miles
* distance < 2 miles, match: full 30%
* 2 miles < distance < 4 miles, distance match: 24%
* 4 miles < distance < 6 miles, distance match: 18%
* 6 miles < distance < 8 miles, distance match: 12%
* 8 miles < distance < 10 miles, distance match: 6%

Requirements for budget match:
* if only one of min or max is provided, min budget = 0.9 * budget and max budget = 1.1 * budget
* if both min and max both are provided
    * min budget < property price < max budget, budget match: full 30%

tuw-eeg,real-estate-scrapers,tuw-eeg,https://github.com/tuw-eeg/real-estate-scrapers,https://api.github.com/repos/real-estate-scrapers/tuw-eeg,"An extensible Scrapy project collecting Real Estate data from the web, piping it into a Postgresql database","# Real Estate Data Scraper Python Package

This Python package serves to collect real estate data from the web. It takes advantage of [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
to scrape data from the web, in combination with [web-poet](https://web-poet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
and [scrapy-poet](https://scrapy-poet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to decouple the scraping logic (the HTML structure of
different real estate websites) abd the spider logic (the logic to collect the data).

## Docker Setup

Configure the environment variables to be used by the Docker services:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

You can either continue with the default variable values, or modify them to your liking.

Build the images using `docker-compose`:

```shell
docker-compose build
```

Start the services:

```shell
docker-compose up db -d && docker-compose run --rm scraper bash
```

A Bash session inside the container will be opened, in which you can interact with the `scrapy` project. For example, to
start the scraper on all support websites, you can execute the following command:

```shell
scrapy crawl real_estate_spider
```

## Local Development Setup

### Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage Python packaging and dependencies. To install `poetry`
itself, please refer to the [official docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Kindly install the dependencies using the following command:

```shell
$ poetry install
```

### Configuration

In order to persist the scraped items into a PostgreSQL database, please create `src/db.cfg` with the following
contents:

```ini
[connection]
database =
host =
port =

[credentials]
user =
password =
```

If you decide not to use the PostgreSQL pipeline, kindly edit `src/real_estate_scrapers/settings.py` accordingly:

```python
# src/real_estate_scrapers/settings.py
ITEM_PIPELINES = {
    # ""real_estate_scrapers.pipelines.PostgresPipeline"": 300,
}
```

### Usage

As this package is a valid Scrapy project at its core, you can use it as you would use any other Scrapy project.

For the concrete use-case of our organization, we use the following command to run the project:

```shell
make run
```

This will run the project locally, and will persist the scraped items into the configured PostgreSQL database.

## Supported Real Estate Websites

The currently supported real estate websites are:

- https://www.immowelt.at/

### Adding support for a new website

Thanks to `web-poet` and `scrapy-poet`, it is possible to add support for a new website with minimal effort. One needs
to create a new `.py` file in the `src/real_estate_scrapers/concrete_items` directory, and implement
the `RealEstateListPage` and `RealEstatePage` classes. That's it! The registration of the implementation to the spider
is done auto-magically.

### Crawling items only from a specific website

In order to avoid re-running the crawling for every single supported website, one can pass the `-a only_domain=<domain>`
argument to the spider. For example, if one wants to crawl items only from the `immowelt.at` website, then the command
to be executed from the `src` directory is:

```shell
scrapy crawl real_estate_spider -a only_domain=immowelt.at
```

leonjovanovic,ml-real-estate,,https://github.com/leonjovanovic/ml-real-estate,https://api.github.com/repos/ml-real-estate/leonjovanovic,Python application of machine learning algorithms in real estate price prediction.,"# Machine learning application in predicting prices of real estate

## Summary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to predict prices of real estates for sale in Belgrade, Serbia. Learning process was done by [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) and [kNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithms.
  * First, it was necessary to create web crawler which will scrape real estates from various websites. 
  * Secondly, we needed to write a Python scripts to preprocess data. 
  * Thirdly, we used MySQL and Python scripts to generate queries and plots. 
  * Finally, we used Python to create linear regression and kNN and generate prediction.

## Web crawler & scraper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data was scrapped from two websites ([4zida.rs](https://www.4zida.rs/) and [nekretnine.rs](https://www.nekretnine.rs/)) using [Scrapy framework](https://scrapy.org/) written in Python. Data, which was scrapped, has a total of **over 100,000 different real estates** over whole country. For each real eastate following features were scraped: price, type, city, address, square footage, year built, land area (for houses), floor, registration, heating type, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, parking, elevator, terrace. Since each real estate ad is manually added by user, many features were often missing. Output for each website was [json file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) where each element had one real estate and its features.

## Preprocessing data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First step in preprocessing data was merging all data we got from different website into single json file. After that it was necessary to convert all characters and strings to integers or floats. Some ads were written in cyrillic and they had to be converted to latin. There were 5 special cases where user wrongly inserted information that was hard coded. Numerous real estates were deleted because of feature value error (very low/high price, very high number of rooms etc.).
Goal of this project is to predict prices of flats for sale in Belgrade, therefore separate json was created with real estates belonging to that category.

---
Address was separately converted to number because of its complexity. Because location is often key factor in predicting price of real estate, [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/maps) was used to convert addresses to coordinates. After that [Geopy library](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) was used to calculate distance between [center of Belgrade](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%98%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0+%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B0/@44.8133536,20.4593651,18z/data=!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x0:0x0!2zNDTCsDQ4JzQ3LjkiTiAyMMKwMjcnMzEuMiJF!3b1!8m2!3d44.8132984!4d20.4586731!3m4!1s0x475a7b05667b6193:0x4a1ff6d1eae390cd!8m2!3d44.8132192!4d20.4604688) and given coordinate.

## Visualization
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get more general sense of real estates, six graphs were created.
- Top 10 most popular districts in Belgrade by number of avaliable real estates

![Plot1](visualisation/a/izgradjene_nekretnine.png)

- [Flats by number of square footage](visualisation/b/stanovi_po_kvadraturi.png)
- [Real estates by year of construction](visualisation/c/izgradjene_nekretnine.png)
- [For sale/rent by city](visualisation/d/prodaja_iznajmljivanje.png)
- [Price of real estates divided in six groups](visualisation/e/cene_po_opsegu.png)
- [Real estate with/without parking in Belgrade](visualisation/f/izgradjene_nekretnine.png)

## Linear regression
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since not every real estate has every feature, we had to remove some features that had very high amount of real estates ad with empty field. Remaining features which were chosen for linear regression features were **address, square footage, floor, number of rooms, parking, elevator and terrace**. Before learning data had to be normalized and shuffled. Learning was done by **nested 10-fold cross validation** with train and dev set so we can find best hyperparameters. There are two hyperparameters: **learning rate** and **mini-batch size**.

---

After finding best hyperparameters, **10-fold cross validation** was done on test and train (now train set is equal to train and dev set from previous step) set. This was first time evaluation is done on test set. Performanse was calculated with [average root mean squared error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) and [average mean absolute error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error). Next step was training linear regression on whole data using chosen hyperparameters to get best parameters which were exported to [JSON file](\linear_regression\model_parameters.json) for future use.

## kNN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since kNN is lazy learner, it does not have learning part but there was normalization as hyperparameter to find out does normalization helps in this case or not. K can be manually imputed or automatically calculated as square root of number of real estates. Distance from imputed real estate was calculated with two different methods. First was [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance), where distance between two points is calculated using the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem). Second method was [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) where distance between two points is the sum of the absolute differences of their [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). kNN does not have any parameters but for algorithm to predicts it needs to run throughout every real estate in data each time.

## Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Output of each algorithm should be number from range from 0 to 4, where 0 represents price of real estate is under 50,000e, 1 is price between 50 and 100,000e and 4 is over 200,000e. At the evaluation linear regression sees test data for the first time and evaluates its parameters on that data. kNN on other hand just compares each real estate with rest of the data.

- ***Linear regression achieved ~67% accuracy***
- ***kNN achieved 64% without normalization*** and 60% with normalization

## Future improvements
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both linear regression and kNN proved not so efficient against complex problem, which means we should use algorithms that are more suited for solving very complex problems like [polynomial regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression), [SVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine), [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) or [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning).

Data is only retained for properties that have historical sales.  It does not extract data on all listings.

Unfortunately there is no API on Allhomes so these scripts are fragile to any CSS changes.  Thankfully they
have used some unique class codes which helps to target specific data on the page.

This does generate a reasonable amount of site traffic but there is no parallel processing which should make
the crawler more palatable to the IT team.  Nevertheless, best to run late at night in off-peak times.

DanielFarahani,corelogic_pyclient,,https://github.com/DanielFarahani/corelogic_pyclient,https://api.github.com/repos/corelogic_pyclient/DanielFarahani,python client for coreLogic API,"# Corelogic API Python client

## Overview

This is a Python client for the [CoreLogic API](https://developer.corelogic.asia/apis/docs/overview-au).  
Makes interfacing with the API much easier.

I haven't seen any clients/ wrappers for Python, so this is a start. 

## install
```bash
pip3 install corelogic-pyclient
OR
pip install corelogic-pyclient
```

## Usage 
1. create an account on [developer.corelogic](https://developer.corelogic.asia/user) for a API credentials
2. add **Client ID** and **Secret** to enviroment variable  
> bash script to run everytime
```bash
#E.g. create setup.sh (Then chmod +x setup.sh)
#!/bin/bash
client_id='<Your Client_id>'
secret='<Your secret_code>'
```
> OR manual process
```bash
#or export in the terminal
export client_id='<Your Client_id>'
export secret='<Your secret_code>'
```
3. Import
```python
>>> import corelogic.property as prop
>>> details = prop.Details()
>>> details.property_attributes(<property_id>)
{'beds': 2, 'baths': 1, ...}

>>> suggestions = prop.Suggest()
>>> suggestions.suggest_properties('1 ahern place monash')
```



### Endpoints

The structure of the package is similar to the Postman [collection provided](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7051651/S1EJWfxt) by CoreLogic.  
You can import class/folder of the API separately and use the endpoint through the methods.

* Suggestion
* Search
* Property Detail
* Automatic Valuation model (AVM)



## Tasks
Pull requests and collaboration is greatly welcomed!

- build out the endpoints of interest
- Refactor to better form factor
- Complete Health check
- Complete Tests

## Goals
- Given the API is $ per request scheme it would be good to cache
- reduce the API endpoints from the website to minimal set as there is alot of overlap in response data
- Better error handling
- Look for API version updates
- Better messaging for the response payload

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Overview
### - Exploratory Data Analysis of housing data (Insights):

- Missing values handling
- All numerical variables
- Distribution of numerical variables
- Categorical variables
- Cardinatily of categorical variables
- Outliers
- Relationships between dependent and independent features


### - Feature engineering framework:

- Splitting data into train and test set with stratified sampling tecnique to preserve distributions found in the housing data
- Creation of an advanced custom transformation pipeline with helpfull tools such as: median imputer, log normalization, custom column modifiers, rare category handler, NaN dropper, categoric variable encoder and variables scaler. (to clean and transform in a fast way future raw sets)

*Note: I could have used ScikitLearn tools such as imputer or Ordinal Encoder, however to add more value to the project and have more control I defined my own cleaning functions*

### - Feature selection framework:

-Use filter algorithms simple methods such as Chi square and Correlation matrix methods to have an initial visualization.

- Different regression embeded methods will be used to determine feature importance and select the best features to feed our models:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- XgBoost Regression
- Permutation Regression

*I propose 2 ways of selecting best features, one is simply selecting the top occurrences total sum of the counts, the second one is selecting the the features that appeared as a top in at least 2 different models*

### - Model selection, training and tunning:
Diferent algorithms to find the one with the best metrics and results for this problem

Models proposed:
- Linear Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support vector machine regressor
- KG-Boost Regressor
- K-n Neighbor regressor
- Lasso Regressor

### - Results summary

A regressor tool for estimating housing sale price was developed from scrath with excelent results, reaching a 88% accuracy in test set. All steps and assumptions were important to reach this result

Package | Version | Type
------- | ------- | ----
`Devpro.Yanport.Abstractions` | [![Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Devpro.Yanport.Abstractions.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devpro.Yanport.Abstractions/) | .NET Standard 2.1
`Devpro.Yanport.Client` | [![Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Devpro.Yanport.Client.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devpro.Yanport.Client/) | .NET Standard 2.1

## How to use

- Have the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Devpro.Yanport.Client) in your csproj file (can be done manually, with Visual Studio or through nuget command)

```xml
<Project Sdk=""Microsoft.NET.Sdk"">
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include=""Devpro.Yanport.Client"" Version=""X.Y.Z"" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

- Make the code changes to be able to use the library (config & service provider)

```csharp
// implement the configuration interface (for instance in a configuration class in your app project) or use DefaultYanportClientConfiguration
using Devpro.Yanport.Client;

public class AppConfiguration : IYanportClientConfiguration
{
    // explicitely choose where to take the configuration for Yanport REST API (this is the responibility of the app, not the library)
}

// configure your service provider (for instance in your app Startup class)
using Devpro.Yanport.Client.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var services = new ServiceCollection()
  .AddLogging()
  .AddYanportClient(Configuration);
```

- Use the repositories (enjoy a simple, yet optimized, HTTP client)

```csharp
using Devpro.Yanport.Client;

private readonly IPropertRepository _propertyRepository;

public MyService(IPropertRepository propertyRepository)
{
    _propertyRepository = propertyRepository;
}

public async Task GetProperties()
{
    var properties = await _propertyRepository.FindAllAsync();
}
```

## How to build

Once the git repository has been cloned, execute the following commands from the root directory:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

## How to test

For integration tests, to manage the configuration (secrets) you can create a file at the root directory called `Local.runsettings` or define them as environment variables:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<RunSettings>
  <RunConfiguration>
    <EnvironmentVariables>
      <Yanport__Sandbox__BaseUrl>https://api.yanport.com</Yanport__Sandbox__BaseUrl>
      <Yanport__Sandbox__Token>xxx</Yanport__Sandbox__Token>
    </EnvironmentVariables>
  </RunConfiguration>
</RunSettings>
```

And execute all tests (unit and integration ones):

```bash
dotnet test --settings Local.runsettings
```

1. Watershed Property Management, Inc. Watershed is responsible for managing thousands of residential rental properties throughout the United States. 
2. The target of this project is to persuade Watershed‚Äôs management team to pursue a new strategy for managing its properties that will increase their profits.

# Description of the project
- Watershed Properties is a residential property management company. We manage several thousand properties in more than 60 different neighborhoods around the United States.
- Watershed currently has a time-sensitive opportunity to explore the short-term rental market with one of its top property owners?
- Watershed wants to know: 
  1. calculate how much it would cost to convert and maintain each of this client‚Äôs properties as a short-term rental.
  2. determine the nightly rental price that would maximize the profits from each of these properties, if they were converted to short-term rentals.
  3. calculate which properties would have increased profits as short-term rentals.
  4. determine how profitable, overall, it would be if Watershed converted some of this client's properties into short-term rentals. 
  5. need to determine how much cash Watershed would need in order to realize any potential profits from converting the properties.

# Database description
1. the current monthly rent Watershed charges for all of their client‚Äôs 244 properties, as well as the property type and geographic location of those properties.
2. some general information about examples of short-term rental properties. This information can be used to get a sense of what kind of nightly rental price Watershed‚Äôs client‚Äôs properties could be listed for, if they were converted to short-term rentals.
3. records about when those short-term rental properties were rented out, so that you can calculate their occupancy rates.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Save listings and see images even when sold][product-screenshot]](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FYNB8Z12rdCa1LEVZW7Da3XolLC2H70C7f5fK1fvIBl5cz3AhaW0CmjUPHnGzHZ7G_fJzd0-sA=w640-h400-e365)

Chrome extension that automatically saves history of real estate from websites. Keep track of sold properties and view images and details of real estate, even when sold.

WHY NEED IT?
* Compare the condition of the house/apartment with images, not just numbers.
* Compare neighbourhood.
* Save your dream home for later.

What you can't do, yet:
* Get images of every sold real estate property. For legal reasons we do not store data online. Each extension stores the data locally synced with their Chrome Browser.

### Assignment 3 - COL772(Spring'19): Natural Language Processing
#### Creator: Navreet Kaur[2015TT10917]
 
#### Motivation:
The motivation of this assignment is to get practice with sequence labeling tasks such as Named Entity Recognition. More precisely you will experiment with the BiLSTM-CRF model and various features on real estate text.

#### Scenario: 
Different real estate agents share noisy text messages on a real estate platform to inform buyers about new properties available for sale. We will call these text messages, shouts. As a company interested in automating real estate information, our first step is to perform NER on these shouts so that important and relevant information can be extracted downstream.

#### Problem Statement: 
The goal of the assignment is to build an NER system for shouts. The input of the code will be a set of tokenized shouts and the output will be a label for each token in the sentence. Labels will be from 8 classes:
- Locality (L)
- Total Price (P)
- Land Area (LA)
- Cost per land area (C)
- Contact name (N)
- Contact telephone (T)
- Attributes of the property (A)
- Other (O)

#### The Task: 
You need to write a sequence tagger that labels the given shouts in a tokenized test file. The tokenized test file follows the same format as training except that it does not have the final label in the input. Your output should label the test file in the same format as the training data.

shscampbell,saleawhen,,https://github.com/shscampbell/saleawhen,https://api.github.com/repos/saleawhen/shscampbell,A Flask web app that provides time-of-sale estimates for home listings in the Calgary market. The model used by Sale A-When is the result of a survival analysis carried out on a large sales data set.,"# Sale A-When?
## Predicting the time to sell your home in the Calgary, Alberta, Canada market. Receive data-based forecasts of days-on-market for your Calgary listing at <a href=""http://saleawhen.site/"">http://saleawhen.site/</a>

This is the source code for a webapp I created as an <a href=""http://www.insightdatascience.com/"">Insight Data Science Fellow</a>. This was part of a consulting project for a Canadian real-estate startup. The company was interested in creating a model that could predict how long a listed house would take to sell. They provided a proprietary data set of over 50 000 sold homes since 2010, including detailed information about each property and their neighborhoods. That data resulted in the predictive model used by Sale A-When.

The webapp is a webform that queries users for relevant details about their listing and for the level of confidence that they want to have about how long it will take their property to sell. For example, if the user selects a confidence level of 99, the resulting output would be the number of days required for 99% of similar listings to sell.

## Motivation
An accurate prediction of the number of days expected for a home to sell is valuable information for anyone planning to sell their home. It helps sellers make appropriate moving plans and it helps them pinpoint the best time to put their property on the market.

This information is also important to property investors who need to understand the liquidity of their assets. Home flippers who buy properties to upgrade and re-sell them at a profit need to estimate how much holding costs will eat into their profit margins, such as mortgage interest, property insurance, and maintenance.

Sale A-When provides information about how different upgrades to a property could impact the days-on-market. Information about the full days-on-market distribution is also provided so that sellers can make appropriate contingency plans for every eventuality.

Tokyo is the capital and the most populus city of Japan. The price of residential area in Tokyo has an average increase of 2.5% for the past 7 consecutive years. Specifically, Toshima-ku's land price increased by 10.9% compared to 1 year before. It is the second-highest increase in price among Tokyo's residential areas. _(Reference: https://www.realestate-tokyo.com/news/standard-land-prices-tokyo-2019/)_

This project is a part of my undergraduate seminar in data science. In this project, I used the data from the Land General Information System of the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism to analyze the real estate landscape of two wards of Tokyo, Toshima Ward and Suginami Ward. 

The goal is to predict house prices by training various ML models and selecting the one with the best performance.

The aim was to analyse the real estate market and predict the house prices in Mysore, Karnataka. A streamlit web-app is built for better visualization and prediction.

<p align=""center""> <img align=""middle"" width=600px src=""./Images/photo_2021-06-30_14-01-51.jpg"" /></p>

### Data Extraction
* The data is extracted from websites https://housing.com and https://99acres.com
* Only houses and apartment prices were considered leaving behind empty lands and commercial properties

### Data Cleaning
* The raw data is further cleaned resulting in five columns in the file `combined_cleaned.csv` are `Location`, `Beds`, `Price`, `Area`, `PricePerSqft`

### Model Building
* The data features were one-hot encoded for `location` and `Number of beds` and fed to the model.
* Linear Regression performed the worst as expected for a small dataset
* `gridsearchcv` was performed and was inferred that decision tree algorithm performed the best among `linear, lasso, decisionTree` algorithms. Later, `randomforestRegressor` was used to increase the accuracy.

### Deployment
Streamlit offers a great platform to host webapps easily.

RichieGarafola,Redfin-NewYorkHousingMarket,,https://github.com/RichieGarafola/Redfin-NewYorkHousingMarket,https://api.github.com/repos/Redfin-NewYorkHousingMarket/RichieGarafola,"This is a large dataset of nearly 7 million rows! Is the Housing Market crashing? Housing market data is most useful at the zip code level. The housing market data will include features such as sale price, homes sold, new listings, days on market, and price drops. This project includes a Tableau Dashboard (link is attached to the readme!)  ","# New York Housing Market - Redfin

![NYC Counties](Images/NYSRegionalMap.jpg)

*How do you know if it is a good time to buy or sell real estate?*

There are numerous factors that contribute to the health of a real estate market including median sale price, homes sold, new listings, median days on market, price drops, etc.

The housing market data is stored in the MLS (multiple listing services). Access to the MLS requires a real estate license for that particular region.

*How do we get monthly housing data if we are not licensed agents?*

We can use online brokerages, such as Redfin, that consolidate housing market data nationwide on a monthly basis down to the zip code level.


Redfin is a real estate brokerage, meaning we have direct access to data from local multiple listing services (MLS), as well as insight from our real estate agents across the country. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre able to use the earliest and most reliable data on the state of the housing market. Using these tools, we can visualize and download housing market data for metropolitan areas, cities, neighborhoods and zip codes across the nation.

The first part of this project we will get housing market data for a list of zip codes using Python. 

The data will then be visualized in Tableau.

---

**Problem Statement**

We need to answer whether the housing market is crashing or not?

We understand housing market data is most useful at the zip code level, therefore we need up-to-date data for all zip codes in our districted county.

The housing market data will include features such as sale price, homes sold, new listings, days on market, and price drops.

The data should be updated on weekly basis and be computed on a 12-week window.

**This will allow us to gauge whether our housing market is shifting to a buyer‚Äôs or seller‚Äôs market!**

---

## Data Source

We will use the Zip Code Region Data from Redfin‚Äôs Data Center.
    
    'https://redfin-public-data.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/redfin_market_tracker/zip_code_market_tracker.tsv000.gz'

---    
    
## 1. Import Libraries

First, import the required libraries.

    - pandas
    - datetime
    - time
    - warnings
    
---    
    
## 2. Data
Read in Housing Data File

The Redfin monthly housing data file is broken out into seven regions: National, Metro, State, County, City, Zip Code, and Neighborhood.

For our use case, we will focus on the zip code dataset.


To locate the file navigate to Redfin‚Äôs Data Center. 

https://www.redfin.com/news/data-center/

Right-click ""Zip Code"" to locate the link address.

![Zip code data](Images/zipCodeData.png)

---

## 3. Data Loading

In the notebook, we will read the file within memory. This allows us to read our file from within our environment without having to download the file locally.

The zip code dataset is in a tsv000.gz format. We use pandas to read in the file from our URL.
we can use the pandas read_csv() function to accomplish this.

![Read in Data](Images/readInData.png)

The file taakes nearly 6 minutes to load! 
The dataset includes: **6.6+ million rows of data and 50+ columns!**

---

Below is the comprehensive list of the features in our dataset:


**median_sale_price:** The final home sale price covering all homes with a sale date during a given time period where 50% of the sales were above this price and 50% were below this price.

**median_list_price:** The most recent listing price covering all homes with a listing date during a given time period where 50% of the active listings were above this price and 50% were below this price.

**median_ppsf:** The median list price per square foot of all active listings.

**homes_sold:** Total number of homes with a sale date during a given time period.

**pending_sales:** Total homes that went under contract during the period. Excludes homes that were on the market longer than 90 days.

**new_listings:** Total number of homes with a listing added date during a given time period.

**inventory:** Total number of active listings on the last day a given time period.

**months_of_supply**: When data are monthly, it is inventory divided by home sales. This tells you how long it would take supply to be bought up if no new homes came on the market.

**median_dom:** The number of days between the date the home was listed for sale and when the home went off-market/pending sale covering all homes with an off-market date during a given time period where 50% of the off-market homes sat longer on the market and 50% went off the market faster. Excludes homes that sat on the market for more than 1 year.

**avg_sale_to_list:** The mean ratio of each homes sale price divided by their list price covering all homes with a sale date during a given time period. Excludes properties with a sale price 50%

**sold_above_list:** The percent of homes sales with a sale price greater than their latest list price covering all homes with a sale date during a given time period. Excludes properties with a sale price 50% above the listing price or with a sale price 50% below the list price.

**price_drops:** How many listings dropped their price in a given time period.

**off_market_in_two_weeks:** The total number of homes that went under contract within two weeks of their listing date.

Let‚Äôs filter down our dataset on a state of interest. Here we select ""NY"" for New York.
![State Filter](Images/stateFilter.png)

*This reduces our dataset by ~93%! Our dataset is now much easier to work with.*

---

## 4. Data Merging

For our use case, we will select a handful of zip codes to review. Therefore, we read in the geography dataset from Github to map zip code, county, and state.

It is best practice in data analysis to start with a sample set before applying logic to an entire dataset.

![Sample Data](Images/SampleDataset.png)

For our analysis, let‚Äôs imagine our market is Suffolk County, on Long Island in New York. Therefore, we only want to focus in on counties that include and surround the city.

![NYC Counties](Images/NYSRegionalMap.jpg)

Now we filter down the geography dataset to only include zip codes within the counties of interest.

![Filtered Zipcodes](Images/filteredZips.png)
![Invalid Zipcodes](Images/invalidZips.png)


Remove the invalid zip codes to produce a clean dataset of geographies within our interested counties.
![clean Zipcodes](Images/cleanZips.png)


Next, we add a feature zipcode from our housing dataset to extract zip code from the region field.

This allows us to join our housing dataset to our geography dataset of zip codes we care about.

![Zipcode Feature](Images/zipFeature.png)

---

## 5. Data Cleansing

Best practice in data analysis is to review and sample data at the granular level to confirm validity.

Here we filter on a single zip code and property type.
![Isolate Singular Zipcode](Images/11763.png)

---

## 6. Features

There are three features that we add to our dataset:

**latest_period:** Flag for the latest time period in our dataset.
**city:** Drop duplicate columns from the DataFrame merge
**median_dom_mom:** Recalculating median days on market MoM to fix bad data.

![Add Features](Images/addFeatures.png)

# Python 3 / Django 2-based real-estate website

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This has been developed for learning Django 2+ & Python 3+ & Microsoft Azure & DevOps (Docker, Traefik, etc.) and many other new technologies.
This project is in the state of development.

:triangular_flag_on_post: To create something akin to <https://www.wg-gesucht.de> which would provide students and landlords a way to advertise their free rooms.

The ""source of creating such web application"" was an article <https://www.respekt.cz/sousede/nekolik-nezavislych-lidi-bydli-v-jednom-pronajatem-byte>.

**Briefly:** In the Czech Republic, there are a lot of real-estate portals but very few exist which are dedicated to just student housing.
Facebook/Social media and university forums are addressing the need in this space.

Compared to <https://www.wg-gesucht.de> (in Germany), in a similar form and scale there is nothing* and thus the objective is to create a web application which fills the gap.

`*` Never say never.

# Predicting real estate prices in France using XGBoost 

This project is a Machine Learning model to predict real estate prices of properties across France. It is a supervised regression task. The model used for this project is XGBoost.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the data of 350+ real-estate properties across France. The features are:

* the city where the property is located (Aix-En-Provence, Vincennes, Toulouse, Paris, Marseille, Manosque, Lyon, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, Gif Sur Yvette, Enghien Les Bains or Bourg La Reine)

* the region (Paca, Ile de France or Sud Ouest)

* the type (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7)

* the area in square metres 

* the rent per year in ‚Ç¨  

* the price of the property in ‚Ç¨

## Features importance

![Image of features importance](https://github.com/tlemenestrel/France_Real_Estate_Prices_Prediction/blob/master/Images/xgboost_features_importance.png)

For this dataset, the two most dominant features are clearly the annual rent and the area of the property, which is expected for a regression model on real estate prices. The other features help to fine-tune the accuracy of the model.

How COVID-19 will impact the real estate market in Italy is hard to predict. The real estate industry is being hit by the coronavirus, and it‚Äôs going to get worse before it gets better. The effects on real estate will vary by sector and market, and the extent of the effects will depend upon the duration of the economic shutdown.

The sectors of real estate that have been hit hardest so far are hotels, restaurants, bars and other entertainment destinations followed closely by retail and housing.

In this project we will be investigating the trend of residential real estate sector in Milan, Italy, before and after the coronavirus outbreak, in particular before and after Feb 21st. The residential sector focuses on the buying, selling and rental of properties used as homes or for non-professional purposes. The residential real estate sector is comprised of single-family homes, apartments, condominiums, planned unit developments, and more.

We will be scrapping the data from kijiji.it for all the available renting apartments offerings or postings on the platform from January 1st until April 15th. kijiji is an online advertising service fully owned subsidiary of eBay launched in February 2005. Kijiji websites are available for more than 100 cities in Canada and Italy.

## Project Goal
Real Estate investment research is time consuming because of the lack of a single place to find all the information related to home value tendencies, school ratings, flood zones, crime rate and amount of transactions happening per zip code in Houston. The following dashboard responds to an investor with a ranking of neighborhoods in 9 Zip Codes in the Houston area to invest in. The ranking depends on the investor preferences in terms of budget and importance of 7 parameters: tolerance to crime, tolerance to risk, home sales, school ratings, acreage, % of value increase of the property and SQ-FT.

## General Workflow
The coding approach was divided in 4 main components:
* 1-	Database: Postgres Database was used to store 9 tables with a total of 150,000 rows where data related to single family properties in 9 selected Zip_Codes in Houston is stored. The data contains property description such as address, latititude, longitude, value, sq_ft, acreage, flood zone, crime risk and schools ratings. This database runs in Heroku cloud server.
* 2-	Python: Python calls the SQL database, where most of the data is filtered and merged in SQL. Then, calculations are done to generate a ranking of the neighborhoods to invest in depending on users criteria.
* 3-	Python Flask: the development of the web application is done thru the Flask web framework. 2 routes were created: 1 for the main page and a second one for the results page.
* 4-	Visualization: HTML and CSS files were generated to create the visualization of the results, using a combination of bootstrap, leaflet and d3.

## Detailed Description

### Database
A Heroku-Postgres database was created based on the following ETL diagram. The data consisted of 9 tables with a total of 150,000 row swhere data related to single family properties in 9 selected Zip_Codes in Houston is stored. The data contains property description such as address, latititude, longitude, value, sq_ft, acreage, flood zone, crime risk and schools ratings. This database runs in Heroku cloud server.
![Figure1](Images/ETL.png)

## Python layer
Python processes the data to calculate the 5 top neighborhoods for investment based on the users selected preferences. Python outputs a json file.

## Flask web framework
Python Flask was used for the development of the web application. 2 routes were created, one for the home page and another one for the process of the results.

## Visualizations
### Homepage
* The main part of the screen shows a map with the location of the 9 zip codes of interest.
* The user can view the boundaries and popup information of each of these parameters in a layer.
* The banner in the left, allows the user to go thru the preferences for max budget and the importance for decision about sales frequency, school ratings, crime, flood, value increase of the property, acreage and sq_ft.
* The user presses submit, which triggers the Python processing layer.
* The code then accesses the database and pulls only the data relevant to properties less than the users selected budget.
* The code further processes this data based on the users other input preferences and ranks the neighborhoods.
* The results visualizations are triggered.

![Figure2](Images/Page1.GIF)

### Results Page
The code outputs visualizations of the top 5 neighborhoods in the ZIP Codes available and ranked based on the user criteria.

While the data is processing from the user inputs a progress bar is shown.  The duration of the progress bar animation is based on average load time for the program.

Once the data is ready, the visualizations are loaded.

The visualizations consist of:
1) A map showing the top 5 nieghborhoods locations, with popups for more info about each neighborhood
2) A horizontal bar chart showing the total scores of each neighborhood based on the users inputs.  This chart shows more info when the user hovers over each bar.
3) An interactive bar chart, where the output is determined by the users choice in a dropdown menu.  The bars show more information when the user hovers over them.
4) A table showing the scores for each parameter of each of top 5 neighborhoods calculated from the database information and the users ranks of parameter preference.

The user can also access the raw json data from the api through a multi parameter or budget route.  The accessible API routes are listed when
the user clicks the ""APIs"" tag on the top navigation menu.

### Abstract

The onset of blockchain generation within Bitcoin has generated significant interest by showing an opportunity to eliminate the middle ground need and transform communication between people and machines by increasing trust. Initially restricted to the integrated currency domain, people began to see the power of a generation beyond just the cryptocurrencies, which brought the acceptance of the blockchain era to erase the world‚Äôs problems. One such situation is problems for e-governance companies in other areas of the public sphere. In the scope of this thesis, we have specifically addressed the issues within the traditional property registration system. This thesis discusses the new design and architecture for real estate transactions and implements it using a blockchain-based solution and addressing issues including record integrity, privacy, and most importantly the lack of common platforms among concerned government organizations. The advent of the blockchain era led to the creation of blockchain-enabled platforms like Hyperledger Fabric. It is one of the most popular open-source permissioned blockchain frameworks, created and supported by the Linux Foundation and IBM, used in many industrial scenarios. So, it is used to create a network with one ordering organization with an ordering node and one peer organization with two peer nodes to prove the concept. Chaincode similar to Ethereum‚Äôs smart contract contains the logic to perform all operations and modify the ledger data. All the methods of chaincode are accessed using the Fabric gateway in the web application to perform various operations.",1,1,1,0,real-estate,"[chaincode, hyperledger, hyperledger-fabric, land-records, real-estate]",0

**Problem statement:**  
It is not straight forward for a newcomer to Dubai to understand how prices are assigned to listings. E.g. at first glance several listings of studio and 1 bedroom apartments in the given two areas of Dubai have approximately same yearly price while square area is quite different. Is studio a good value for its money in comparison to 1 bedroom flat?

Questions to answer:  
 - How many options by number of bedrooms are there to choose from? 
 - Do studios, 1 and 2 bedroom flats differ significantly in their square areas and features, what is different about them?
 - ...
  - ...

## About Dataset

### Content

In this dataset we have information about **4800+** apartments available for rent in Downtown and DIFC areas of Dubai in August 2022. Listing have different parameters like:  
*rental price, address, number of bedrooms, area in sq.ft., description, building info, amenities, etc.*

	<sub>Dataset preview</sub>
</p>


### Columns / Features

`price` -  Listed in AED  
`address` - Including the name of the building or/and complex, district, city  
`beds` - Number of bedrooms  
`baths` - Number of bathrooms  
`area-sqft` - Area of the apartment in square feet  
`description-title` - Title of the listing  
`description` - Additional information  
`reference-no` - Reference number on the website  
`date-added` - Publishing date (day, month and year)  
`balcony-size-sqft` - Area of the balcony in square feet  
`parking` - Yes/No   
`building-info-name` - Building name  
`building-info-floors` - Building hight in number of floors  
`building-info-year` - Year when the building was constructed   
`building-info-area-sqft` - Total building area in square feet  
`furnishing` - Furnished/Unfurnished   
`features-amenities` - Additional building/flat features  


<details>
<summary>Dropped columns (click to expand)</summary>

These columns were dropped at the beginning of analysis:

`apartmet-link-href` -  unnecessary for analysis   
`rent-frequency` - only Yearly listings were parsed  
`web-scraper-order` -  unnecessary for analysis   
`web-scraper-start-url` -  unnecessary for analysis   
`pagination` -  unnecessary for analysis   
`apartmet-link` -  unnecessary for analysis but could be added back later   
`building` -  only one name value and the rest is missing values  

</details>

*** 

### Data preprocessing
What was done:
- Many columns contained **missing values** (e.g. number of bathrooms, balcony size, building info, furnishing, etc.) Some had only a few values missing while others a lot. Thos were either filled or the column was dropped altother as it didn't bring value.
- **Data types** were changed to decrease memory usage, e.g price and area columns were converted from object (text) to number and date column - from object to date type.  
- All columns were renamed and blanks were filled with relevant values.

***

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Below is data analysis using visualization to discover trends and patterns, and validate hypothesises.

#### Adding new features

Data enrichment step here is to append or enhance collected data with relevant context obtained from other columns.

`Address` - column containing listing address was split into columns: city, area, building name and tower complex name.  
`Date` - column split into Year, Month, Day and Weekday.   
`Price per square foot` - calculated from listing rental price divided by the area.  
Text containing listing title, description and features/amenities contains keywords some of which were converted into new features:  
`Chiller` - assigned **1** when chiller is free, **0** otherwise. Same for `Parking` and `Bills`.

#### Number of unique values per feature

<p align=""center"">
	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/num_of_uniq_pfeature.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Number of unique values per feature</sub>
</p>

On the diagram above some columns have a high number of unique values ex. **759 options for area in sqrt** while others have much fewer variations ex. **chiller free Yes/No**

#### Prices 

Prices range: 
- start at minimum of 40,000 AED 
- and goes up to 3,000,000 AED, 
- with median value of 180,000 AED.

<p align=""center"">
	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/prices_all.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Prices for all listings</sub>
</p>

Outliers start from price 500,000 and spread up to 3,000,000. Most likely it's a huge apartment with many rooms and that is more luxurious or it's an error.<br><br>

	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/prices_700_000.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Prices up to 700,000</sub>
</p>

Look into most common range of prices for every number of bedrooms shows that majority of all listings are between 90,000 and 300,000 AED. With a very noticeable spike for one bedroom apartments at approximately 100,000 AED. This means with budget of 100k there's a much higher number of one bedroom options to choose from than with budget even 5k lower. Also adding nother 5k would not increase number of options much.<br><br>

<p align=""center"">
	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/all_bdr_prices_boxplot.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Prices boxplot</sub>
</p>

Boxplot demonstrates spread and skewness of rental prices by number of bedrooms. This diagram indicates variability outside of the upper and lower quartiles.  

One very noticeable thing is that four-bedroom apartments not only have huge interquartile range, but also very long whiskers on both sides, where left whisker overlaps with median price of three-bedroom listings. This could be another error, possibly smaller total area or a building on the edge of the district.

Interestingly interquartile range for studios and 1 bedroom apartments is almost the same. Studios prices have nearly symmetrical distribution, while 1 bedroom listings distribution has a heavier right tail. That discovery raises a new question, why rent a studio if it's in the same price range as one bedroom listings? Perhaps those studios has larger areas, are located in more prestigious buildings or are furnished. At teh same time, if lower rental price is a prioriy, rgere are studios to choose from. 


#### Area

Area range: 
- start at minimum of 37 sq.ft.,
- and goes up to 6,792 sq.ft.,
- with median value of 1,346 sq.ft.

Area of 37 sq.ft. is obviously an error. Largest areas could be an error too or a misplaced listings that were supposed to be under a commecial category (offices, shops, etc).

<p align=""center"">
	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/area_4_500.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Area in sq.ft. up to 4,500</sub>
</p>

On the diagram above difference in total areas is clearly visible, with just a minor overlap of 1,700-2,000 sq.ft. for 2 and 3 bedroom apartments.<br><br>

<p align=""center"">
	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/all_bdr_area_boxplot.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Area of each bedroom boxplot</sub>
</p>

Even though there're some studios with area above 750 sq.ft., still most of them are well apart from 1 bedroom listings.
Interesting fact: areas have less ranges in each category which makes sense - apartments in tall buildings tend to be alike by size and floorplan.
Another thing is that areas are much more apart from one another than rental prices which means price heavily depends on additional facts, not square area alone.

#### Bedrooms

After all data preprocessing there're 4,802 listings left:  

- Studio: 435
- 1 Bedroom: 1474
- 2 Bedrooms: 1983
- 3 Bedrooms: 832
- 4 Bedrooms: 75
- 5 Bedrooms: 3

<p align=""center"">
	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/number_of_bdrs.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Number of bedrooms</sub>
</p>

**TOP-3** most listed options would be 2, 1 and then 3-bedroom apartments respectively.  

***

## 1 & 2 bedroom apartments analysis
For further analysis only 1 and 2 bedroom listings will be reviewed.

Earlier, while [checking for unique values](#number-of-unique-values-per-feature), **2204** were found in the description and **2219** by the description title. Manual processing would be time consuming, so finding most commonly used words / phrases would be much more efficient. TOP-30 phrases should be enough.

<p align=""center"">
	<img src=""https://github.com/imeleges/REMA_Dubai/blob/main/img/wordclouds.png?raw=true"">
	<sub>Word cloud for description (left) & description title (right)</sub>
</p>

There are few common phrases such as `Real Estate`, `Burj Khalifa`, `Downtown` and etc. that should be ignored as they bring no value.  
Meanwhile useful phrases like `Fully Furnished`, `Fitted Kitchen`, `Chiller free`, `Swimming pool`, `Bills included` etc. may affect prices, so could be useful.

### Prices

|Prices range |1 Bedroom| 2 Bedrooms|
|:--- | :---: | :---:|
|Count|1,474|1,983|
|Min|59,998|76,990|
|Median|115,000|225,000|
|Max|280,000|600,000|

	<sub>1 & 2 bedroom prices from 60,000 to 450,000</sub>
</p>

In the most common range of prices from 60,000 to 450,000, 1-bedroom apartments are concentrated between 80,000 and 130,000, where 2-bedrooms are distributed much wider across the range.

This allows us to quickly grab details about a certain place, get directions, details about a community, schools near by, and the opportunities to expand the community as a whole in a better shape.","# Commutaire-SVHacks: 

http://www.sriharshaguduguntla.com/commutaire

Built at SV Hacks 2016 with Jai Sankar and Mitesh Malaviya.

#Inspiration

In our community we lacked a lot of connection to each other, so we decided to develop Commute. Commute was based of the many requests that we got from high school students, teachers, and various mentors. We believed that in order to reach the community in a strong way, we not only needed to connect with them virtually, but also physically through transportation. Along with this issue, also arose education which is a high priority in our generation today which was also another key factor that led us to this endeavor.

#What it does

Commute is an application that allows to connect with the community in such a way that finding real-estate was much easier along with connecting to education that is heavily important for advancements in society. This allows us to quickly grab details about a certain place, get directions, details about a community, schools near by, and the opportunities to expand the community as a whole in a better shape.

#How we built it

We used various libraries such as numerous Google API's, Firebase, Node,js, Uber, Zwillo, and many more frameworks were used to provide much more functionality. We also included as a double platform through iOS and web.

#Challenges we ran into

We ran into various challenges when having to write algorithms based on the users location and what preferences would fit them based of their society. Getting a valid list of school near a community was definitely a challenge for us overall, and having to work with various backend issues was also another plus.

#Accomplishments that we're proud of

Some accomplishments we are proud of are writing complex/machine-learning algorithms to better enhance the user experience by providing with relevant details toward the user. Functions such as implementing Uber/Zwillo was also another major key learning experience that we are proud of because we found the opportunity to learn various backend languages and frameworks.

#What we learned

We learned new types of programming including OOP programming, backend programming logic, writing server side code, and much more through the various issues we faced. We enjoyed the entire program as it provided us manny opportunities to grow as programmers

#What's next for Commute

We would love to see an android app in the future.

This is a group project created by Team The Underdogs for Georgia Tech class CX 4242. The goal of our team was to create a real estate data visualization that allows users to investigate trends historical and forecasted data. Our team trained a machine learning model, ARIMA, that forecasts prices into future years based on the historical trends in our dataset.
The visualization is a web-based chloropleth map that allows users to quickly see which states are the most and least expensive in a given year. Users may input the parameters year and number of bedrooms to change the chloropleth map.

## INSTALLATION:

Once the CX4242-Housing directory is on your machine, you will need to run a http server in the directory to view the web tool. Luckily, if you have Python installed, it is easy to run a server in the command-line. Simply navigate to the root directory of the project in the command line and then enter the command ""python -m http.server"". The server will start running and you may go to 0.0.0.0:8000 in your web browser of choice (we recommend Chrome since we are using D3). You should see now the contents of our project directory in your browser. To open the web visualization tool navigate to the Visualization directory and then click chloropleth.html. The tool should open in a new tab and you will see our final product!

## EXECUTION:
The user may select the year and number of bedrooms that they are interested in. The default when the tool is opened is 1 bedroom in the year 2010. When the user hovers their mouse over any state, a tooltip should appear displaying the state name, median rental price, and median property price for that year and number of bedrooms. There also should appear two line charts below the map when the mouse hovers over a state showing the time-series data for these two variables including our model's predictions for future months. The user may select a future year from the dropdown to see a forecasted chloropleth map. We suggest that the user should choose several different combinations of year and number of bedrooms to start getting a feel for the data and how the web tool works. The most expensive states according to the user's parameters are always shown in dark green while the least expensive states are showin in light green. When there is no data that state will appear gray.

Model leveraged real estate transactions easily with `mortgage_mage`! Helps you answer questions such as:

- What size down payment maximizes my expected IRR?
- What's the highest interest rate I could accept before my NOI is unacceptable?

## Key Features

- Convenient pro-forma framework makes it easy to evaluate investments
- Pulls the latest mortgage interest rate data from multiple market sources
- Computes useful metrics, such as cash-on-cash return and IRR
- Factors in your personal tax situation

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/schmidt-jake/mortgage_mage.git
```

## Getting Started

TBD

## Feature Roadmap

1. Tax ‚Äî record tax deductible transactions, compute final tax liability given marginal income tax bracket, compute metrics on after-tax P&L
1. Stochastic modeling ‚Äî create an MCMC interface to model the variation of P&L
1. Data layer ‚Äî enhance the mortgage market data sourcing, add sources for rental market and housing market

## Notes

The median interest rate (computed from `rate_scraper.get_rate_distribution`) isn't very sensitive to changes in LTV.

Input distributions:

- Rental revenue
- Property tax rate
- Property appreciation/depreciation rate

We'll also need:
A mortgage rates function that relates interest rate with loan-to-value and loan amount, accounting for PMI and second lien.

This project encompasses a real data case for a junior data analyst job opportunity at Seazone.
Seazone uses OTAs (Online Travel Agencies) like Airbnb, Booking and Expedia, as well as its own
website, to find guests interested in booking a short stay - usually lasting less than a month
per reservation. Each property is advertised as a ‚ÄúListing‚Äù. For this analysis, I used two databases
related to the listings and the booked rooms to answer a few business questions. The description of the project can be found in [references/seazone_challenge.pdf](https://github.com/carolmoraescruz/case_seazone/blob/master/references/seazone_challenge.pdf) and the final report is the file [reports/final_report.pdf](https://github.com/carolmoraescruz/case_seazone/blob/master/reports/final_report.pdf).

This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

# Deploy this app to cloud (AWS EC2)

1. Create EC2 instance using amazon console, also in security group add a rule to allow HTTP incoming traffic
2. Now connect to your instance using a command like this,
```
ssh -i ""C:\Users\Viral\.ssh\Banglore.pem"" ubuntu@ec2-3-133-88-210.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```
3. nginx setup
   1. Install nginx on EC2 instance using these commands,
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```
   2. Above will install nginx as well as run it. Check status of nginx using
   ```
   sudo service nginx status
   ```
   3. Here are the commands to start/stop/restart nginx
   ```
   sudo service nginx start
   sudo service nginx stop
   sudo service nginx restart
   ```
   4. Now when you load cloud url in browser you will see a message saying ""welcome to nginx"" This means your nginx is setup and running.
4. Now you need to copy all your code to EC2 instance. You can do this either using git or copy files using winscp. We will use winscp. You can download winscp from here: https://winscp.net/eng/download.php
5. Once you connect to EC2 instance from winscp (instruction in a youtube video), you can now copy all code files into /home/ubuntu/ folder. The full path of your root folder is now: **/home/ubuntu/BangloreHomePrices**
6.  After copying code on EC2 server now we can point nginx to load our property website by default. For below steps,
    1. Create this file /etc/nginx/sites-available/bhp.conf. The file content looks like this,
    ```
    server {
	    listen 80;
            server_name bhp;
            root /home/ubuntu/BangloreHomePrices/client;
            index app.html;
            location /api/ {
                 rewrite ^/api(.*) $1 break;
                 proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
            }
    }
    ```
    2. Create symlink for this file in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled by running this command,
    ```
    sudo ln -v -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bhp.conf
    ```
    3. Remove symlink for default file in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled directory,
    ```
    sudo unlink default
    ```
    4. Restart nginx,
    ```
    sudo service nginx restart
    ```
7. Now install python packages and start flask server
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install -r /home/ubuntu/BangloreHomePrices/server/requirements.txt
python3 /home/ubuntu/BangloreHomePrices/client/server.py
```
Running last command above will prompt that server is running on port 5000.
8. Now just load your cloud url in browser (for me it was http://ec2-3-133-88-210.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/) and this will be fully functional website running in production cloud environment

## Models

models/models.py

Business objects are declared as Python classes extending Model which integrates them into the automated persistence system. Models can be configured by setting a number of attributes at their definition.


```python
    # Strings
    name = fields.Char(string=""Title"", required=True)
    description = fields.Text()

    # Date
    start_date = fields.Date()
    start_datetime = fields.Datetime('Start time', default=lambda self: fields.Datetime.now())
    
    # Numbers
    duration = fields.Float(digits=(6, 2), help=""Duration in days"")
    seats = fields.Integer(string=""Number of seats"")
    active = fields.Boolean(default=True) # Boolena

    # Relational fields
    responsible_id = fields.Many2one('res.users', ondelete='set null', string=""Responsible"", index=True)
    instructor_id = fields.Many2one('res.partner', string=""Instructor"")
    course_id = fields.Many2one('openacademy.course', ondelete='cascade', string=""Course"", required=True)
    session_ids = fields.One2many('openacademy.session', 'course_id', string=""Sessions"")
```

When a new fields are adding is necessary to restart Odoo and upgrading the module.

```bash
$ service odoo restart
```

### Computed fields

```python
    taken_seats = fields.Float(string=""Taken seats"", compute='_taken_seats')

    @api.depends('seats', 'attendee_ids')
    def _taken_seats(self):
        for r in self:
            if not r.seats:
                r.taken_seats = 0.0
            else:
                r.taken_seats = 100.0 * len(r.attendee_ids) / r.seats
```

### Inheritance

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from odoo import fields, models

class Partner(models.Model):
    _inherit = 'res.partner'

    # Add a new column to the res.partner model, by default partners are not
    # instructors
    instructor = fields.Boolean(""Instructor"", default=False)

    session_ids = fields.Many2many('openacademy.session',
        string=""Attended Sessions"", readonly=True)
```

### Onchange

The ‚Äúonchange‚Äù mechanism provides a way for the client interface to update a form whenever the user has filled in a value in a field, without saving anything to the database.

```python
    @api.onchange('seats', 'attendee_ids')
    def _verify_valid_seats(self):
        if self.seats < 0:
            return {
                'warning': {
                    'title': ""Incorrect 'seats' value"",
                    'message': ""The number of available seats may not be negative"",
                },
            }
        if self.seats < len(self.attendee_ids):
            return {
                'warning': {
                    'title': ""Too many attendees"",
                    'message': ""Increase seats or remove excess attendees"",
                },
            }
```

### Constrains

- Python constraints
- SQL constraints

```python

from odoo import models, fields, api, exceptions

....

    @api.constrains('instructor_id', 'attendee_ids')
    def _check_instructor_not_in_attendees(self):
        for r in self:
            if r.instructor_id and r.instructor_id in r.attendee_ids:
                raise exceptions.ValidationError(""A session's instructor can't be an attendee"")
```
## Views

views/views.xml

Tree and a form views, with the menus opening them. Actions and menus are regular records in database, usually declared through data files. Actions can be triggered in three ways:

- by clicking on menu items (linked to specific actions)
- by clicking on buttons in views (if these are connected to actions)
- as contextual actions on object


**Basics views*

- Tree views <tree>. List views, display records in a tabular form.
- Form views <form>. Forms are used to create and edit single records. 
- Search views <search>. Search views customize the search field associated with the list view (and other aggregated views).

Adding in __manifest__.py

```xml
    # always loaded
    'data': [
        # 'security/ir.model.access.csv',
        # 'views/views.xml',
        'views/templates.xml',
        'views/openacademy.xml',

I ommitted the Sphinx and the Test portions of the tutorial.
The tutorial is outdated, I used a newer version of Ruby and Rails.
I also used MySQL instead of PostgreSQL.
Maybe in future I create my own tutorial based on this tutorial but with updated code.

* Ruby 2.2.5p319

* Used MySQL57 instead of PG

* Get bonuses for openining new checking/savings accounts
* Must have minimum balance
* Deposit a certain amount
* Chase Checking/Savings Account
* Citi Bank
* Capital One 360
* PNC Bank

# RE TIPS
* Dont try to time the market
* The source of the deal doesn't matter (on MLS vs off MLS)
* Hire a good real estate agent
* Get pre-qualified before buying a house
* Vacancy is about 8-10% because 8% of 365 days is almost 1 month. A 4% vacancy means you can find a new tenant in 2 weeks.
* Leasing fee is charged when managment company finds a new tenant. Usually 50% of first months rent.
* A class property: Appreciation
* B class property: Both
* C class property: Cash Flow
* Look for around ~12% cash on cash ROI and $200 cashflow for SFH
* Leverage is (Debt Owed / Value of Real Estate)
    * Good leverage is 65-70%
    * So if you have a $300,000 house, your debt on that house would be $195,000 and your equity at 105,000)

# FINDING DEALS:
* Look at the county's home appraisal value. This will be the county's assessment of the home price.
    * Dallas County : http://www.dallascad.org/SearchAddr.aspx
    * Look at the home owners, tax history. See how much they pay in Taxes and if they have any outstanding tax payments.
    * https://www.dallasact.com/act_webdev/dallas/searchbyproperty.jsp
    * If someone has outstanding payments, they may be more likely to accept a deal lower than the asking price.
* To estimate rent rates in your area:
    * Go to https://www.rentometer.com/
* Look for ~12% Cash on Cash ROI
* Use Rental Property Caluculator on Bigger Pockets
    * https://www.biggerpockets.com/real-estate-investment-calculator
* If offer is rejected, set a reminder to follow up with them x weeks later, to see if they changed their mind.
    * Set a reminder in via biggerpockets calculator
* If property has been on market for a long time, dont give your best deal. Offer less and negotiate.
* If property is a good deal and hot, you may want to not lowball.


# LESSONS FROM HUSTLE4LIFE (https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonaivanov/)
* 32 years old, bought first property (duplex) when he was 26
* Makes $150k from regular job and $150k from DealCheck
* He messaged local investors on Bigger Pockets to learn more
* He works non stop (6hrs/day on weekends)
* Likes to buy 5 4-plex rather than 20 SFH
* Uses conventional financing (30 year mortgage) with FlagStar
* Has 2.5 million in debt, and 65% leverage
* He and wife bought properties separately with their own names to get more of a loan
* Had a 70% savings rate for 10 years
* After building enough equity in 1 property, he would immediately cash out refinance (switch his currently mortgage with a new one and taking the home equity out as cash to use for another down payment) them to purchase new properties
    * If his equity goes over 40%, he will refinance to get it back down to 20% and use the other 20% for another down payment
* Buys in Atlanta (1), Birmingham (3), Kansas City (28 in Missouri)
    * One location was in Raytown, Kansas City (north of river)
    * Most of his are in Riverside (north of river and downtown)
    * Good link to best areas of Kansas City (https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/48/topics/276800-kansas-city-missouri-zip-codes?page=1)
* Purchases at $50-80k per unit (Usually duplexes and fourplexes)
    * $100,000 - $160,000 for duplex   <- best for cash flow and returns
    * $200,000 - $320,000 for fourplex
* Averages $250-300 per unit in cash flow
* Don't buy under $200 per unit cash flow
* Build a local team of agents, property managers, and lenders
    * Meet them in person before buying
    * Always flies out see the property (2-3 day trips)
        * View other properties in that time, meet with team, view property wanting to buy
* Look for multiple property managers (8% cost is good. Shouldn't cost more than 10%).
    * View his checklist here (https://gallery.mailchimp.com/8b7931e477fd5142f0f163ee5/files/5b132b47-1afa-4f9e-a864-e0c65c38b460/Property_Manager_Interview_Questions_Turnkey_Rentals_101.pdf)
    * Talk with them about the target rent. Discuss that your rent estimates are accurate
    * What are their leasing guidelines? Pets or no pets, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year leases. Section 8?
    * Ask them what their fee sheet is
    * Ask them what their current rent roll is and copies of all current leases
    * Operating/income statements for the last 2 years
    * Have there been any insurance claims/losses in the last 5 years?
    * How do they handle late payments and evictions?
    * Any receipts/warranties for any appliances purchased by the current owner that convey with the property
    * Scope of work/dates of any rehab work done by the current/past owners
    * Property manager does everything including screening tenants (background check, criminal history, income verification, rent collection, etc)
* If hard to get tenant, move-in incentive. Maybe first month of rent is 1/2 price.
* Analyzing markets is especially important for out of state
    * Look at climate, population, economy, job growth, economic diversity, median home price, rent value ratios, landlord laws
    * Then call brokers, agents, property managers, lenders, investors in that area to learn about that market

* After getting some conventional loans (allowed a maximum of 8-10 conventional loans but sometimes cant get more than 3-5), he got commercial loans from Bank of the West for 2-4 unit properties. This is rare but if you build a relationship they can lend you money on residential properties.
    * Bank of the West gave him 25 year amortization, 10 year terms, and good interest rates
* Does 2-4 units per year
* Buys value-add properties that need 5,000 - 10,000 of work (this is used out of pocket)
    * Keeps existing tenant there, then when they leave, rehab it to raise rents and re-lease
* Get a realtor to create a MLS feed that matches your criteria, this is better than using Zillow, Trulia, etc
    * Find agent with investment background, not a regular agent
* Driving for dollars works
    * Sent 100 letters, got 10 responses
    * Letter contained personalized info (like owners name, house picture, and offer in details)
        * Pick a reasonable price, decide how to finance it (Cash is best, but he didnt do this)
        * Skip agents and offer to pay their closing costs
    * Send them a letter every 6 months if no contact
    * Lowball the offer because you cant see the inside and it will require work
* He estimates 10-15% vacancy
* Keeps 5-6 months of expenses for each owned property as a emergency fund per property
* He raises rents because he thinks its a business
* Likes B class areas
* Doesnt like buildings over 50-60 years old (1950s), prefers newer than that
* Avoid flood zones
* Review monthly reports that property manager will send you
* Keep record of all maintenance, even small things because it may lead to more problems (drain clogs up a lot, etc)
* At the end of the year the property manager should do a walk-through inspection to see if everything looks good
* Likes 10-12% cap rate. But when estimating extremely conservative (12% vacancy, 15% repairs, etc), 6-7% works too.
* When analyzing a deal, don't just give estimates.
    * Rent
        * Look at the current lease for the current rate
        * Use Craigslist to find similar properties in the area
        * Use Rentometer
        * Contact local property managers in the area and ask what the rent should be (send them the address of your property)
    * Vacancy
        * Multifamily will have higher vacancy
        * Dense populations will have less vacancy
    * Property Tax
        * Look it up online
        * Be careful of homestead exemption, which means if the owners family dies, they may get less taxes. So if I buy, my taxes would be different
        * Check if your state re-assesses the property tax after a sale (some states do this)
    * Insurance
        * Usually doesnt cost $1,000/year for a SFH
        * A good rate is about $500/year for a $200k condo
* 3 most important metrics for him are:
    * Cash Flow (looks for $250/unit)
    * Cash on Cash (looks for 15%)
    * Internal Rate of Return (looks for 20-25%)
    * Cap Rate Not as Important~~~ (looks for 10-12%, or worse if strict estimates)
* Maintenance estimates:
    * A class - $1,200/year
    * B class - $2,400/year (maybe)
* Cap ex estimates (break them down individually):
    * Break down each major appliance:
        * Example: Roof, current age 5, Projected lifespan of 20 years, $4,000 replacement cost
        * Example: HVAC, current age 10, Projected lifespan of 15 years, $2,500 replacement cost
    * Make a schedule based on those estimates and divide their costs by 12 months.
* Buy in primary/secondary cities that have 1,000,000+ population.
    * Basically the largest cities in a state, not smaller ones
* How to calculate IRR (https://www.reddit.com/r/realestateinvesting/comments/8rdp2j/how_to_calculate_the_internal_rate_of_return_of_a/e0r2brh/)
* Look at flood risk and dont buy flood areas (http://floodtools.com/Home.aspx)
* Doesnt buy properties with structure, electrical, plumbing issues
* Only looks for houses that need paint job, new flooring, new appliances, maybe new kitchen cabinets, maybe bathroom work
* Big fan of Dallas and Houston, it was top 5 list of his market analysis (but couldn't afford the market)
* Other cities on his list were Charlotte & Nashville 
* Had a hard time finding good deals on the MLS.
    * Spent 10 months doing direct mail (sent 100 personal letters to MFH and got 4 to sell)
* Plans on selling his worst performing SFHs in the future
    * Possible opportunity to buy???
* Driving for Dollars:
    * Since it was ""as-is"" he got financing via commercial loans, since residential loans needed inspections and valuation
        * His lenders didnt care about the condition of the property, only the loan to value ratio (LTV and LTV after rehab)
            * The most important thing lenders try to look at is debt coverage ratio, so sell them on this number.
            * Debt coverage ratio (DSCR) is NOI / annual mortgage debt service (principle and interest payments)
    * Visited 2 neighborhoods he was interested in with MFH
    * Got each address in a spreadsheet
    * Looked up each owners tax info, etc 
    * Wrote one page letter with intro, offer terms (include ""no agent"", ""no commissions"", ""as-is condition""), and contact info
        * No agent means no sales commission but only do this is you have a good escrow company and dont mind writing purchase contracts yourself (or hire a lawyer)
        * Told them he was serious and gave an introduction about himself
    * Attached a picture of the property
    * Wrote price of property on front of letter (big and bold)
    * One accepted his as-is offer
    * One negotiated extra $5k
    * Another wouldnt budge until he offered to pay closing costs and property taxes
    * He offered below market price and well below if it was slightly rehabed and rented at market price
    * He assures them that he has financing, funds, team lined up and doesnt try to act too sales-ie
    * If looking at a $200,000 property, he would offer $150,000 - $175,000
    * If worried about issues with the house (not being able to see inside), keep the contingency there so you can potentially back out during escrow and potentially negotiate a lower price.
* Always fixes things that are broken like HVAC, water heater, holes in walls, etc
    * Doesnt worry about too many cosmetic things that are over the top (nice carpet, stainless steel, etc)
* Look for a nice property with a specific type. Then find what it rents for. See what his current property looks like compared to that property and determine how much rehab it needs to meet the nice properties standards and rent.
* 1 KC property:
    * $3,000 gross rent ($750/unit)
    * 8% vacancy
    * $1,100 taxes/year
    * $1,000 insurance/year
    * 8% property management
    * $2,400/year gross maintenance
    * $600/year cap ex
    * $25/month landscaping
    * $150/month utilities
    * $821/month total expenses
    * NOI $1,940 ($485/unit)
    * $757/month loan payment
    * Cash Flow: $1,182/month ($296/unit)
* 5% maintenance expectations are low, try to project for around 10%?
* 1 Property:
    * Purchased for $190,000 as a 4 plex (added $12,000 in rehab)
    * $3,000 gross rent ($750/unit)
    * 8% vacancy ($240/month)
    * $895 in expenses/month ($1,100/year in taxes, $950/year in insurance, 8% in property management, $200/month maintancence, $100/month cap ex, $150/month water and trash, $50/month in landscaping and snow)
    * NOI $1,868/month ($467/unit)
    * Loan payments: 789/month (30% down, 25 year amortization, 5.15% rate)
    * Cash flow: $1,079 ($270/unit)
* In Kansas City, he likes Grandview and Lee's Summit (especially down south)
    * Zip code 64110 is ok, but too expensive
    * Never buy in 64128 or 64129/64130
    * Hyde Park is ok if its north/west, closer to 71 is sketchy
* Best way to find good property managers is from referrals, make sure investors say they are good to work with. Don't go with smaller companies, go with bigger ones.    ",0,0,1,0,real-estate,"[investing, notes, real-estate]",0
nekomamoushi,home-finder,,https://github.com/nekomamoushi/home-finder,https://api.github.com/repos/home-finder/nekomamoushi,A snake bot that will find your new home !!!,"# Home Finder

This bot will scrape different apartment provider and find results matching your criteria.
It has to be run periodically and if he finds new results, you will be notify.

## Settings

First, you need to fill the settings with your criterias.
You can use this [sample](samples/settings.yml).

### Search

  * `MIN`
  * `MAX`
* `rooms`
* `bedrooms`
* `cities`

### Notification

* `name`: the notifier name
* `type`: the type of notification
* `trigger`: the trigger

## Limitation

For now, there is only:

* One provider: [SELOGER](www.seloger.com)
* One notifier: [IFTTT](www.ifttt.com)
  * One type: `webhook`


## Setup

Before using this bot, you'll need an account on Dropbox and IFTTT

* Dropbox
  * Create an acccount if you don't have on
  * create a directory named `home-finder`

# Overview:
The 2019 Trulia Real Estate Dashboard explores the distribution of real estate sales in the United States listed on Trulia.com. 
 The data comes from the period between September 1st, 2019 and October 31st, 2019. The interactive map displays the price, square feet, and the number of beds and baths in each unit. 
 In addition, there is a bar graph that explores which unit size is the most popular,
 and a donut graph that shows the distribution of units that were built in each decade.

# How to Populate the Database:
1.	Clone the 'trulia-real-estate' repository onto your computer.
2.	Open pgAdmin and create a new database called 'real_estate_db'.
3.	Open a query tool in 'real_estate_db' and navigate to the ETL folder in the 'trulia-real-estate' repository.
4.	Select the file 'queries.sql'.
5.	Run the create table code to create the 'trulia_real_estate' table. 
6.	Run the create table code to create the 'locations' table.
7.	Run `select * from trulia_real_estate` and `select * from locations` to ensure that the tables were created.
8.	Open a Jupyter Notebook in the 'trulia-real-estate' repository. 
9.  In the ETL folder, create a text file called 'config.py'. In this file, write down your pgAdmin username, password, localhost, and port.
10.	Open ‚Äòreal_estate_etl.ipynb.' and run all cells.

# How to Set Up the Leaflet Map:
1. Navigate to the static folder and select the 'js' folder.
2. In the js folder, create a file called 'config.js'. In this file, write down your API_KEY from mapbox.com so that the leaflet map can run.

# How to Run the Flask:
1. At the base level in the 'trulia-real-estate' repository, create a config.py that contains your pgAdmin password, username, localhost, and port.
2. Open GitBash in the 'trulia-real-estate' repository.
3. In GitBash, write `source activate PythonData`.
4. Write `python app.py` to get the flask running.
5. In Google Chrome, write `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and then you will have the Flask running.

## Business Problem
A real estate investment company has asked us to select the top five US zip codes to invest in.  
 
## Data
We examined more than 30,000 records from Zillow that included house prices across different zip codes from 1997-2021. We found additional data from Realtor.com that was used in the selection of the top 5 zip codes. The Zillow dataset contained 316 columns most of which were different dates from 1996 to 2021 with house prices in that zip code. We compressed the dataset into only 10 columns with the time becoming the index column and the values melting into a single column based on their zip code. To create the dataset used for zip code selection, the Zillow and Realtor.com datasets were merged on zip code and record dates. In order to select the zip codes that would yeild the largest ROI, we considered both market and housing characteristics. 


 #### Data from Zillow

 #### Data from Realtor

## Methods

### Zip Code Selection

For market evaluation, we considered the average pending ratio and average number of days a listing is on the market for. Pending ratio is the ratio of number of listings pending (listings that have accepted an offer) divided by the total number of active listings for a given month. For listing evaluation, we considered the average house value and the number of listings that underwent a price increase. 

For each of these characteristics, we chose to account for the percent change in these averages from one month to the next. This would allow us to choose zip codes that continuously showed growth in the pending ratio, average house value, and number of listings. We counted against houses that showed monthly growth in the number of days on the market.

We weighted the average of these columns for each zip code with the following equation:

zip code score = 0.4(house value change) + 0.2(pending ratio change) + 0.2(price increase change) - 0.2(days on market change)
We selected the top 5 zipcodes with the highest scores.
    
## EDA Results Notable Features


### House Value and Price Increase Count

![image](./images/house_value_and_price_increase_count.png)

4/5 selected zipcodes contain houses with higher values than the other zipcodes combined. Zip code 28546 has homes with lower values, but a very high price increase rate of change. This indicates an 'up and coming' zip code, where the homes have consistently garnered value throughout time. 

### Pending Ratio and Days on Market
![image](./images/pending_ratio_and_days_on_market.png)
 
The average days a property is on the market is not a sufficient indicator of consumer demand, because pending properties, or properties that have accepted offers, are still considered 'on the market'. To judge consumer readiness, we selected zipcodes that outpreformed the other zipcodes for increased the number of pending houses while having comparitavely lower days on market increases. 

 
## Modeling Results
We build multiple time series models ranging from a simple naive model to a Facebook Prophet model. The metric we chose was `RMSE` since we want the lowest error between the actual and predicted price of houses in the five recommended zip codes. For two of the zip codes, we used SARIMAX since it not only produced a low RMSE but was better at capturing recent trends in the data and using those trends to make predictions five years into the future. For the other three zip codes, we used a Facebook Prophet model. This model was able to get the lowest `RMSE` while still capturing the recent trends in the data and making future predictions based on this. Here are the top 5 zip codes along with their `RMSE` values:

![image](./images/zipcodes.PNG)  
    
## Conclusions
Using our custom score for determination, we selected five US zip codes for the best real estate investments: 84045 (Saratoga Springs, UT), 98642 (Ridgefield, WA), 28546 (Jacksonville, NC), 80016 (Aurora, CO), and 80516 (Erie, CO).  The current and five-year projected prices and ROI‚Äôs are as follows:

For the best projected ROI, we suggest Aurora, CO, with a current median home price of just over $300k and a projected 2026 median price of $439k (for an expected ROI of nearly 45%).  For investors looking for a less capital-intensive opportunity, we suggest Jacksonville, NC, where current average home prices are only around $179k, and expected five-year ROI is almost 27%.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## About

![](https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/508402.jpg)

The dataset consists of lists of unique objects of popular portals for the sale of real estate in Russia. More than 540 thousand objects.
The dataset contains 540000 real estate objects in Russia.

### Content

The Russian real estate market has a relatively short history. In the Soviet era, all properties were state-owned; people only had the right to use them with apartments allocated based on one's place of work. As a result, options for moving were fairly limited. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian real estate market emerged and Muscovites could privatize and subsequently sell and buy properties for the first time. Today, Russian real estate is booming. It offers many exciting opportunities and high returns for lifestyle and investment.
The real estate market has been in a growth phase for several years, which means that you can still find properties at very attractive prices, but with good chances of increasing their value in the future.

### [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrdaniilak/russia-real-estate-20182021)

The dataset has 13 fields.

- date - date of publication of the announcement;

- time - the time when the ad was published;

- geo_lat - Latitude;

- geo_lon - Longitude;

- region - Region of Russia. There are 85 subjects in the country in total;

- building_type - Facade type. 0 - Other. 1 - Panel. 2 - Monolithic. 3 - Brick. 4 - Blocky. 5 - Wooden;

- object_type - Apartment type. 1 - Secondary real estate market; 2 - New building;

- level - Apartment floor;

- levels - Number of storeys;

- rooms - the number of living rooms. If the value is ""-1"", then it means ""studio apartment"";

- area - the total area of the apartment;

- kitchen_area - Kitchen area;

- price - Price. in rubles;

  Also we mine additional data from [OpenStreetMap](https://maps.mail.ru/osm/tools/overpass/):

  - subways;
  - parks;
  - restaurants;
  - museums

### Goal

Our job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set,  we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

### Metric

Submissions are evaluated on [Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)



## Stack

We are testing MLOps approaches to predict houses' prices in Saint-Petersburg:

- Lint Flake8;
- Pytest;
- DVC;
- Docker;
- MLFlow;
- LightGBM;
- CI/CD Github

Jainlo,Landlords,,https://github.com/Jainlo/Landlords,https://api.github.com/repos/Landlords/Jainlo,An exploration of a web scraped real estate data,"# Landlords
In this project we studied the real estate rental market of the four major cities in Saudi Arabia: Jeddah, Riyadh, Alkhobar and Dammam. We explored the relationships of prices with other features. The dataset used is found on kaggle <a href = ""https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lama122/saudi-arabia-real-estate-aqar"">Saudi Arabia Real Estate (AQAR) dataset</a> It was collected and scrapped from <a href =""https://sa.aqar.fm"">Aqar.fm</a>
This report will help officials from the Ministry of Housing understand the current rental landscape for the average consumer (families and singles) in each city. 
A report of the initial <a href=""https://jainlo.github.io/Landlords""></a>[data exploration](./report.html)

## Main features discussed in our report
- City: location of the house
- Price: monthly rent (by building an assumption and performing needed calculations)
- Front: which way is the house front facing; north, west, east, south, south-east, south-west, north-eat and north-west
- Districts: which district the house is located in
## Main issues
After exploring the dataset we found significant issues with it
- Not many observations (total of 1500 units after deleting duplicates)
- District distribution is not fair
- Price periods are ambiguous 
## Solutions
- Combining the dataset with additional datasets to get more complete answers to our questions
- Build an assumption for the price period based on research done on the website ""aqar""
## Main questions
- Which feature is more prominent in expensive real estate?
- Is there a preferred front?
- Is there a front that is more expensive?
- Which side of each city is considered more expensive?
## Key conclusions
- Real estate has higher prices in Jeddah compared to Riyadh, Dammam and Alkhobar (on the date of data collection)
- The features that are more prominent in expensive real estate in order are:
    1. house includes a driver's room
    2. house has a frontyard
    3. house has a garage
- The most expensive front out of the 4 main directions is ""East"", while ""North-east"" is the most expensive overall

# 1. Objective of the First Part of the Project (Crawling M√∂venpick Wine)
The goal of the first part of the project is to crawl this [website](https://www.moevenpick-wein.com/de/rotweine?p=1) and extract the data points shown below
- product_title
- product_name
- product_url
- rating_score (out of 100 or 20)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202925388-aac7ba63-2bca-44fd-9d47-00add9d2aefd.png)

## 1.2. Analysis of the Website
The website is simple to crawl as it does **not** use Javascript to render its content and does not employ sophisticated anti-bot mechanisms. Therefore, The ‚Äúrvest‚Äù package in R is sufficient to crawl the content of the website. In addition to the ```rvest``` package, we use the ```dplyr``` and ```stringr``` libraries to **wrangle** and **clean** the crawled data.

The URL ```https://www.moevenpick-wein.com/de/rotweine``` returns **2177** results. There are **24 results** on each page, which means there are ~ **91 pages** to scrape. The website is **paginated** https://www.moevenpick-wein.com/de/rotweine**?p=1**, meaning we can create a **for** loop to scrape the results from every page by changing the numeric parameter at the end of the URL.

## 1.3. Crawling Process
We start by defining the **CSS/XPath** selectors of **each data point** we want to crawl. The website is well-structured, so every item is stored in a ""list"" with a class ""item"" as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202925458-e9d5dc30-0e42-4738-a042-08119412f16e.png)

The CSS/XPath selectors of the nine data points are as follows:
- **product_title**
  - `span.product-name-1` --> `span` with a class `product-name-1`
- **product_name**
  - The product name is composed of two parts, so we extract them separately and combine them into one variable afterward
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202925544-4a7bcc9f-c2ff-47d6-bd82-190f6acffdbf.png)
  - `p.product-name > span.product-name-part:first-child` --> The CSS selector of the first part of the product_name. `p` with a class `product-name` AND a first child of `span` with class `product-name`
  - `p.product-name > span.product-name-part:nth-child(2)` --> The CSS selector of the second part of the product_name. `p` with a class `product-name` AND a second child of `span` with class `product-name`
  - After extracting both parts separately, we combine them into one variable using the `paste0` function --> `paste0(product_name_p1, "" "", product_name_p2)`
- **product_url**
  - `h2.product-name > a %>% html_attr(""href"")` --> `h2` with a class `product-name` AND a child `a`. Since this is a URL, we extract the `href` attribute using the `html_attr` method in R
- **rating_score and reviewer**
  - The rating score is a composite string that consists of **two parts**
  - **Part 1** is the person/magazine that reviewed the wine bottle
  - **Part 2** is the score out of 100 or 20
  - In the example below, the person who reviewed the wine is ""Tim Atkin"". He gave the bottle a score of 98/100
  - Since the score can be out of 100 or 20, we crawl the raw score in **string format** and also the individual components to calculate a percentage (e.g., 98/100 = 0.98 or 15/20 = 0.75)
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202926510-db9154a0-1f40-4d71-b3a8-47bcee6f003f.png)
  - The CSS selector of the **composite review (reviewer + score)** is `p.rating-score` --> `p` with class `rating-score`
  - **Part one** can be extracted using this regex --> `[a-zA-Z]+`. This regex extracts any characters from A-Z in the string (lowercase or uppercase)
  - **Part two** as a whole can be extracted using this regex --> `\\d+\\/\\d+`. This regex extracts any part of the string that matches this pattern **number/number**
  - The **left part of the raw score** (before the division sign) can be extracted using this regex --> `""\\d+(?=\\/\\d+)`. This regex extracts any digit **before** a division sign that is followed by numbers
  - The **right part of the raw score** (after the division sign) can be extracted using this regex --> `(?<=\\/)\\d+`. This regex extracts any digit **after** the division sign
  - To check how these regular expressions work, one can use this [website](https://regex101.com/). Please note that in R, a double backslash is required. On this website, only one backslash is used
- **country & city**
  - The country and city are displayed together and separated by pipe ‚Äú|‚Äù
  - `p.cellar-name` is the CSS selector of this composite string --> `p` of class `cellar-name`
  - To extract the **country**, one can use this regex --> `\\w+(?=\\s\\|)`. It extracts any word characters **before** "" |""
  - To extract the **city**, one can use this regex --> `(?<=\\|\\s)\\w+`. It extracts any word characters **after** ""| ""
- **price**
  - The XPATH selector of price is `//span[@data-price-type = 'finalPrice']/span` --> `span` with attribute `data-price-type = 'finalPrice'` AND a `span` child
price is displayed as a composite string with the currency symbol (e.g., CHF 950.00)
  - In addition, wines that have 4-digit prices are displayed with an **apostrophe** (e.g., CHF 1,150.00)
  - To handle the **first case**, we can use this regex --> `(?<=CHF\\s).*`. It extracts any alphanumeric character **after** (CHF )
  - To handle the **second case**, we can use the `str_replace` method to replace the apostrophe with a blank character
- **image_url**
  - The CSS selector of image_url is `img.product-image-photo` --> `img` with class `product-image-photo`
  - The URL of the image is stored under an attribute called `src`. We can extract it with the `html_attr` method

After extracting these data points, we can place them in a data frame using the `data.frame` method in R. Since we loop over each page, we can define an **empty data frame** before the ""for"" loop. This data frame will grow over time because we will append the results of each crawling iteration to it. We can use a **temporary data frame within the ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop** to store the results of iteration ""i‚Äôs"", and then bind the results to the data frame we created before the ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop. In code form, this looks something like this...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202926210-ac8de620-e70d-4100-b293-74abcfec09dc.png)

## 1.4. Throttling Our GET Requests
To **stay polite** to the server, we need to throttle our GET requests to prevent our scraper from getting blocked. We can create a function to produce **random time values** and use the `Sys.sleep()` function to **slow down the scraper** in a random fashion. In code form, this looks something like this‚Ä¶

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202926552-58e4cb95-cb2a-4ba2-84f6-173cdd04bd2b.png)

## 1.5. Further Automating the Scraper
To fully automate the scraper, we can extract the **last page number** from the first page and set it as the end of the ""for"" loop‚Äôs range. The first page does not display the last page number, but rather the **total number of products**, as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202926338-e2a583a1-a1dd-4937-843e-ac4c9054fb19.png)

Since there are 24 results on each page, we can calculate the total number of pages using this formula --> `ceiling(last_page ‚Äú2177‚Äù / 24) = 91`

The CSS selector of this number is `div.filter-results-count > strong` --> `div` with class `filter-results-count` AND child `strong`

## 1.6. Bonus Part
The dataset contains the **""price""** and **""country""** fields, we can use these two fields to construct a price histogram per country, as shown below. The code is included in the last section of the .Rmd file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98691360/202926405-cd3603c3-42e7-464a-baa5-bf78be9c90d1.png)

# Real Estate Price Estimation Application Project Using Machine Learning Methods
![](image.png)

## Description:
The project aimed to demonstrate the capabilities of data analysis and machine learning in the context of real estate price estimation.

## Dependencies:

``` python
ipykernel = ""==6.23.1""
pandas = ""==1.5.3""
scikit-learn = ""==1.2.2""
seaborn = ""==0.12.2""
graphviz = ""==0.20.1""
pyflowchart = ""==0.3.1""
notebook = ""==7.0.3""
```

## Installation and Launch Instructions:
1. Install Python version 3.9.x.
2. Install pipenv using the command: ""**python -m pip install pipenv**"".
3. Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies using the command: ""**pipenv install**"", executed in the main project folder.
4. Open the file model_training.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or any environment or software that allows for cell execution. Remember to choose the interpreter from the virtual environment created in the previous step.
5. Run the cells in the file sequentially. The *kc_house_data.csv* dataset will be analyzed and processed, and based on the extracted data, selected machine learning models will be trained and saved.
6. Run the last cell - it will launch a simple GUI application that loads the previously saved machine learning model and, based on the features provided in the text fields, will estimate the property price.

## Intrafoundation Software

[**NOTE**: Currently being Developed/Refactored. CLI commands are almost complete. At some point thereafter once that has settled, a proper web admin will be made. See TODO.]

AtlasGrove takes Tiger/Line shapefiles from the US Census Bureau and renders them into usable images.

Version 2.x of this software is a Symfony 3.x rewrite of older bespoke/framework-less software.

## CLI

This software uses both a CLI and web interface. Do php bin/console list to see complete list. Some examples are:

    php bin/console atlasgrove/status
    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache
    php bin/console atlasgrove/render
    php bin/console atlasgrove/download
    php bin/console atlasgrove/downloads
    php bin/console atlasgrove/dbf
    php bin/console atlasgrove/shx
    php bin/console atlasgrove/shp`

    php bin/console atlasgrove/status

Shows basic settings information.

    php bin/console atlasgrove/download

Downloads Tiger/Line data from the US Census FTP site. You must specify the state number to be downloaded. For example:

    php bin/console atlasgrove/download 47

downloads the data related to Tennessee.

By default all downloaded data is stored out of project/public (and out of vagrant/git/auto-backup paths) one directory above the project down in the cache folder, though there are parameter settings to have it show up in /var/cache. 

    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache

Runs through all downloaded Tiger/Line data and generates a simple intermediate data output file that is used for actual rendering.

    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache --all

or 

    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache

will cache all downloaded data.

You may also specific a single geo region like:

    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache 47
    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache 47001

Optionally the use of the --force flag will cause previously generated data to be overwritten.

Other options are:

    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache --states
    php bin/console atlasgrove/cache --counties

    php bin/console atlasgrove/render

Actually renders data. There are several options here.

    php bin/console atlasgrove/render --all --8k

This for instance, renders all the regions of interest (state and county bounded regions) at 8k resolution. The current resolutions are --vga, --1080p, --4k, --8k and --16k.
You may use the --force option to force regenerating an image even if one already exists. You may also specify a geo region id like:

    php bin/console atlasgrove/render 47 --8k --force
    php bin/console atlasgrove/render 47001 --8k --force

or a bound latitude/longitude region such as:

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render -86,34,-85,35 -v --8k 

    php bin/console atlasgrove/render 47 --roi --8k --force

Adding the --roi flag causes the roi of state 47 to be looked up and then rendered as a bound lat/long region.

JPG or PNG [Todo: SVG]

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47 --png
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47 --jpg

The layers that are rendered can be selected by a csv list such as:

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47001 --roi --layers=water,road,rail,landmark,area
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47001 --roi --layers=area,rail

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47 aspect=Width

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47 region=Clip
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47 region=Roi
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 47 width=999 height=888

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render --states
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render --counties

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render test=tn
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render test=us

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render test=tn --steps
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render test=us --steps

    php bin/console atlasgrove:render 0 --roi --layers=area,road,rail
    php bin/console atlasgrove:render --roi --layers=area,road,rail

Sales of a second house through ‚ÄòNFT‚Äô at Sahara Resort, the host site 
of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics


Sahara Issues Property Rights as NFTs and Trades in Bitcoin
15% cheaper than cash purchase price hosted by online sales

 

Sahara Street LLC announced that the second house of the Pyeongchang Sahara Resort, the host city of the 2018 Winter Olympics, will be sold next month as a non-fungible token (NFT).

NFT refers to a token that represents a digital asset with scarcity and utilizes blockchain technology. Unlike existing virtual assets, digital assets are not interchangeable by giving them a separate, quiet recognition value.

According to Sahara Street LLC, the second house to be sold through NFT is located in Pyeongchang, the host city of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. It features a view overlooking the golf course.

Sahara resort
It is operated by Sahara Street, a blockchain-based real estate technology company headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, USA, and will issue property rights as NFTs to conduct online sales. The sale price is about 400 million won, but it is possible to buy and sell it at about 15% cheaper when trading with Bitcoin or Sahara tokens.

With the advantage of being the host of the Winter Olympics, the company explains that it is possible to generate additional revenue by providing accommodations to ski enthusiasts and seasonal visitors in winter.


The operator, Sahara Street, said: ""Issuing real estate titles as NFTs will allow homeowners to sell their homes as quickly as an online shopping transaction.""

Sahara Street said that it is developing a platform using original technology that allows digital real estate assets to form a higher value than traditional real estate asset values through the platform while operating a meta Sahara resort using GPS in the metaverse space. .

The scripts collect and clean data from various sources to create a dataset with sale price estimates for over 700 thousand properties in New York City. 

The `scripts` folder contains the following scripts:
- `rolling_sales.R`: cleans and joins NYC real estate sales data of the past 12 months. 
- `prices_scraping.R`: scrapes real estate market trends estimates for each NYC borough from Property Shark. For residential properties, the estimates are taken from the table at the bottom of the page. For the other property categories, the estimates are taken from the orange exagons at the beginning of the page (Edit: 4/3/2022). 

The above scripts are used to calculate the variable `est_sale_pr_sqft`. The final sale price estimates are calculated simply by multiplying `est_sale_pr_sqft` by `bldgarea`.

## Abstract

Zillow is an online real estate database company storing data on 110 million homes across the United States not just those homes currently for sale. In particular, Zillow‚Äôs economic research team has been collecting and publishing the housing and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources filled with local municipalities, deeds, property facts, parcel information, and transactional histories. This article takes a data-driven approach to analyzing the US real estate market, attempting to use forecasting algorithms like Prophet and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) to anticipate home and rent values.

**Keywords**: Zillow, Zillow API, Real Estate, Machine Learning, AI, Deep Learning, Time Series, Forecasting, LSTM Neural Network

## Research Questions and Hypothesis

1. How do different types of housing in different regions vary in home value, rent value, and other important indices? 
2. What are the important factors and metrics in determining Zillow Home Value Index as well as Zillow Rent Value Index? How reliable is Zillow Estimate?

## Data

Zillow publishes a gigantic amount of variables useful in better understanding the housing market with timely, accurate, and unbiased manner. Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated home value across a given region and housing type. It is a dollar-denominated alternative to repeat-sales indices. Zillow also publishes home value and other housing data for local markets, as well as a more detailed methodology and a comparison of ZHVI to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. Zillow provides data on sold homes, including median sale price for various housing types, sale counts and a normalized view of sale volume, referred to as turnover. Foreclosures also are provided as ratio of housing stock and as a share of all sales in which the home was previously foreclosed upon. There are current and historical for-sale listings data, generally from 2012 to current, ranging from median list prices and inventory counts to share of listings with a price cut, median price cut size, age of inventory, and the days a listing spent on Zillow before the sale was final. Moreover, I also have Zillow Rent Index (ZRI), which is a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the median estimated market rate rent across a given region and housing type. ZRI is a dollar-denominated alternative to repeat-rent indices. 

For housing type definitions, All Homes: Zillow defines all homes as single-family, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Unless specified, all series cover this segment of the housing stock. Condo/Co-op: Condominium and co-operative homes. Multifamily 5+ units: Units in buildings with 5 or more housing units, that are not a condominiums or co-ops. Duplex/Triplex: Housing units in buildings with 2 or 3 housing units.Tiers: By metro, I determine price tier cutoffs that divide the all homes housing stock into thirds using the full distribution of estimated home values. I then estimate real estate metrics within the property sets, Bottom, Middle, and Top, defined by these cutoffs. When reported at the national level, all Bottom Tier homes defined at the metro level are pooled together to form the national bottom tier. The same holds for Middle and Top Tier homes. 

In terms of regional availability, Zillow metrics are reported for common US geographies including Nation, State, Metro (2013 Census Defined CBSAs), County, City, ZIP code, and Neighborhood. I provide a crosswalk between colloquial Zillow region names and federally defined region names and linking variables such as County FIPS codes and CBSA codes. Cities and Neighborhoods do not match standard jurisdictional boundaries. Zillow city boundaries reflect mailing address conventions and so are often visually similar to collections of ZIP codes.

## Model Training

* [Prophet | Forecasting at scale.](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) - a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.
* LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks - a recurrent neural network that is trained using backpropagation through time and overcomes the vanishing gradient problem in search of the state-of-the-art forecasting result.

## Model Evaluation

For this forecasting task, I rely upon Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is a measure of how the residuals are spreaded out.

The results will be presented in the form of interactive widgets in jupyter notebook for technical audience that can be used to make informed decision about selling their properties.,"## Predicting House Sales Using Machine Learning

### Overview 
In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model to predict whether a house will sell or not based on a set of features. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is a binary variable indicating whether the house sold or not. We will analyze and visualize the data to gain insights into the features that influence house sales.

### Data 
The dataset used in this project contains information about various houses including the number of rooms, hospital beds, hotel rooms, parks, rainfall, the location of the house, and other important features. The dataset also includes a binary variable indicating whether the house sold or not.

### Approach 
We will use a supervised learning approach to train a binary classification model using various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. We will evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, score. The best-performing model will be selected and used for prediction.

### Results 
The trained machine learning model will be used to predict whether a house will sell or not based on the given set of features. The results will be presented in the form of a interactive widgets in jupyter notebook that can be used by technical audience. The end output will help real estate agents and homeowners to make informed decisions about selling their properties.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

The aim of this script is to scrape all properties listed on Rightmove (a popular housing website) within 3 miles of a 
train station on the South-Eastern railway network in the south of England. The properties will range from ¬£100,000 to ¬£350,000 and will try to
exclude retirement properties and shared ownership schemes that are specifically listed on the website as such.

Firstly the script will scrape all stations listed on the railway network. This information will be found on Wikipedia.
Rightmove has a unique set of characters within the URL that direct the user to a specific location. The script finds and scrapes all
area codes for each station that will be used for the scraping of properties later on. These area codes are written to a text file with the
name of each station. This script will run if that file is not already in the same folder as the script.
This file is called Station_Data.txt.

Commute times from each station will be important when considering where to buy. So the script gathers commute times from each station to
London Bridge. Google maps with Selenium is used to collect all commute times if people were to start their commute on the next working day
at 6:30am. The data was written again to a text file and only initiated if the file doesn't already exist.
This file is called Commute_Times.txt.

When we finally have all this data, we can then scrape properties listed within a 3 mile radius of each station with the stations scraped and
the area codes of each station.

Once all the properties for each station have been scraped, the script appends the commute time of each property to the listing, cleans the data
and writes the data to a CSV file called Rightmove_South-Eastern_Station_Properties_DATA_TIME.csv, date and time being the date and time the file
was written.

## üßê About <a name = ""about""></a>

Homelun is a cutting-edge real estate application designed to make property searches easy and efficient. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), TypeScript, React-Query, and Tailwind, Homelun provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for those looking to buy, sell, or rent properties.

With Homelun, users can browse through various properties and apply filters to narrow down their search based on criteria such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, or square footage. The app allows users to request tours of properties and stay in touch with agents for a smooth and hassle-free experience. Homelun's intuitive interface and powerful search capabilities make it the go-to solution for all your real estate needs.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = ""getting_started""></a>

To get started with Homelun, you'll need to set up the server and client environments. First, navigate to the server folder in your project directory and create an .env file. Use the provided env.example file as a reference to fill in the required information. Once your .env file is set up, you can install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```
npm install
or
yarn install
```

After setting up the server, move on to the client folder and repeat the process. Create an .env file using the env.example as a guide, and then install the required dependencies like previous way.

then run both separately with

```
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```

## üöÄ Deploying <a name = ""deployment""></a>

In order to deploy the Homelun, we are utilizing two powerful platforms: Netlify for the frontend and Fly.io for the backend.

# Description:

Our web application BiiG alleviates customers and listing agents to find/rent most suitable properties.It will be exclusively used by real estate agents from the following three local real estate companies SFStateHome, SJStateRealtors and CSURealEstate. They can post content and receive contacts/request from customers/buyers. The title BiiG expresses the following component. Each team member comes from another country. ‚ÄúB‚Äù stand for Bangladesh , ‚Äúi‚Äù for india, ‚Äúi‚Äù for Iran and ‚ÄúG‚Äù for Germany. Diversity and the courage to think big are important features in our team that we also want to reflect with BiiG.

In addition to our unique features,our website is based on the functional range of known real estates sites: For example this includes the search for specific properties by price,size or number of rooms.Afterwards,the interested consumer/buyer can contact directly the corresponding listing agents for the property.BiiG is based on the most up to date technologies and thus offers,with regard to performance at the state of the art.

# Teamwork:
Application Url: https://evening-waters-97508.herokuapp.com/

Teamwork consists of few milestones those include planning, analysis, design, implementation and testing. I work in analysis, design, implementation phases. My role is Backend developer and also perform few development in Frontend as per professor's guidance to switch roles. My contributions in the project as a team member are given bellow:
1. Database design and normalization
2. Create store procedure for creating customer
3. Write some util SQL queries to load data in frontend such as in drop-down menu, checkboxes etc.
4. Create dynamic search, sort SQL query for searching and sorting properties as per user input or filter criteria.
5. Create MVC structure of property search at the beginning of the project so that other members can follow the data-flow of MVC for further development.
6. Worked on the following features:
        property search, 
        add favorite properties, 
        agent dashboard including SQL queries, UI design.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

### 1. About The Project
Real estate information of a particular region or location is not 
easy to come by. In this notebook we investigate an Austrian real estate data set which has been mined
extracted over the course of a week from a large online portal. The data has already been 
pre-processed and can be geospatial investigated.

This app can be viewed live on Heroku at [https://austrian-housing.herokuapp.com/](https://austrian-housing.herokuapp.com/)


<img src=""img/dash-app-screenshot.png"" alt=""Rental prices Austria"" width=""550""/>

### 2. File Structure

`app.py` main dash app <br>
`requirements.txt` python modules that will be installed for the web application at build. <br>
`/assets` this directory is to serve the CSS files and images for the app. `charts.py` is used for generating the figures. <br>
`layout.py` defines the html web layout, `callbacks.py` handles all the callbacks and `data_wrangling.py` is used
for all the data queries and date manipulation. <br>
`/data` contains the raw data files.<br>
`/data/geojson/vienna.geojson` geojson files with the geospatial data of Austria.<br>
`/nb` notebook used for data exploration and analysis. <br>
`runtime.txt` tells (the Gunicorn HTTP server) which python version to use (only needed for Heroku deployment)<br>
`Procfile` defines what type of process is going to run (Gunicorn web process) and the Python app entrypoint
(only needed for a deployment on Heroku) <br>
`.gitignore`<br>

### 3. Installation

#### Getting Started

- Change the current directory to the location where you want to clone the repository and run:

`$ git clone https://github.com/AReburg/Austrian-Real-Estate-Analysis.git`
- Make sure that the app is running on the local webserver before deployment.
Setup your virtualenv (or don't) and ensure you have all the modules installed before running the app. 


#### Requirements
Install the modules from the `requirements.txt` with pip3 or conda from a terminal in the project root folder:

`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
`conda install --file requirements.txt` (Anaconda)
<br>


#### Jupyter Notebook
Executing the notebook is tested on *anaconda distribution 6.4.12.*  with 
*python 3.9.13*.
To view the rendered geospatial charts of the Jupyter notebook go to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) and
copy the link.

### 4. Usage

#### Local Web Application
- Run the app from your IDE direct, or from the terminal in the projects root directory: `python app.py`

- It should be accessible on the browser `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`


### 5. Results
The main findings are summarized in a [post](https://medium.com/@arlin.gruber/how-data-science-can-give-you-an-edge-in-real-estate-investing-1849255d7c33).

## Real Estate Management System

### Project Description
This is a web platform which would help buyers to look at the available properties with photographs, description and necessary specifications. Since any website that isn‚Äôt UX friendly may push potential buyers away, we‚Äôll be focusing on providing easy to use and attractive interface for both the seller and the buyer. Not only that, after quite a through market research we have noticed is that the majority of the Albanian real estate sites do not provide an accurate search engine. We‚Äôll be focusing on developing a powerful search engine that provides accurate GPS location and listing details. Apart from this features, we‚Äôll like to make sure everything is automated as much as possible. We‚Äôll like to make the process of renting/selling a house only a click away. On top of it, we will also be ensuring a quick support availability. This will ensure the both buyers and sellers a way to communicate to someone when they are needing help.

This repository contains SQL queries for the analysis on Japan real estate price from 2005 to 2021.
Withing the scope of this project, only real estates in Tokyo and Saitama prefectures are analysed as
they are the major prefectures. Also, since they are located closed to each other, it is intereting
to see if there is any differences in terms of their price and the number of transactions.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis is a record of real estate transaction prices in Japan from 2005 to 2021, surveyed by the 
MLIT(Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan). contains real estate transaction prices for 47 prefectures in Japan,
yet only Tokyo and Saitama prefectures are included in this study. 

Original dataset can be found on this link: https://www.land.mlit.go.jp/webland_english/servlet/MainServlet

## SQL Queries
- `jp_real_estate_data_cleaning.sql`: a query for data preparation
- `jp_real_estate_data_exploration.sql`: a query for data exploration
- `Tableau Project Queries.sql`: a query for data visualization in Tableau

## Tableau for Data Visualization

The query outputs from `Tableau Project Queries.sql` were transformed and 
saved as excel files for importing into Tableau.

Screenshots of the project visualization are found in `Dashboard Screenshots` folder.

Sample dashboard:

For a complete presentation of the data visualization, please visit the following link:
[JP Real Estate Visualization Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bopith.bun/viz/TableauProject-JPRealEstate/saitamavstokyo)

## Results of the Analysis
Our findings are summarized as follows:
- Both number and average price of real estates in Tokyo are significantly higher than those in Saitama.
- In Saitama, residential land (land and building) has the largest share, while pre-owned condominiums has the largest share in Tokyo.
- Average price of condominiums does not fluctuate much comparing to those of residential lands in both prefectures.

> **Note** - The development was done on macOS. So, all the bin files for fabric network is for macOS. These bin files need to be replaced in case if the network is tested on other OS.

#### Network Bootstrap -
1. Download the project folder.
2. cd to /network path
    ```sh
    $ cd network
    ```
3. Tear down running network and containers for safer side
    ```sh
    $ sh ./fabricNetwork.sh down
    ```
4. Bootstrap the network
    ```sh
    $ sh ./fabricNetwork.sh up
    ```
5. Open 2 new tabs in terminal and bash into 2 chaincode container. For making development and testing seamless, 2 chaincode containers are configured one for registrar org and other for user org. 
    ```sh
    $ docker exec -it registrar.chaincode /bin/bash
    $ docker exec -it user.chaincode /bin/bash
    ```
6. Start the nodejs service in the respective chaincode container.
    a) In registrar chaincode tab -
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    $ npm run start-dev-registrar
    ```
    b) In user chaincode tab -
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    $ npm run start-dev-user
    ```
7. Install and intantiate the chaincode from the /network directory
    ```sh
    $ sh ./fabricNetwork.sh install
    ```
8. Network set up completed.


#### Property Registration test flow -

> Note - Two cli will be used, one for registrar and other for user to support initiator validation. Registrar cli will connect to peer0 of registrar and user cli will connect to peer0 of the user. That way the request will have the respective initiator MSP id. So, user can not invoke the registrar functionality and vice versa. 

1. Bash into registrar and user cli.
    a) Registrar tab -
    ```sh
    $ docker exec -it cli /bin/bash
    ```
    b) User tab -
     ```sh
    $ docker exec -it user.cli /bin/bash
    ```
2. Two users Ashlesh and Harshit requests for registration. 
    From user cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.user:requestNewUser"",""Ashlesh"", ""sorteeashlesh@gmail.com"", ""9994293900"", ""12345""]}'
    
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.user:requestNewUser"",""Harshit"", ""harshit@gmail.com"", ""8894293900"", ""54321""]}'
    ```
3. Registrar accepts both the user‚Äôs registration request. 
    From registrar cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.registrar:approveNewUser"",""Ashlesh"", ""12345""]}'

    ```
4. User Ashlesh raise the request for property registration. 
    From user cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.user:propertyRegistrationRequest"",""Ashlesh"", ""12345"", ""001"", ""100""]}'
    ```
5. Registrar view and verify the property registration request by Ashlesh. 
    From registrar cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.registrar:viewPropertyRequest"",""Ashlesh"", ""12345"", ""001""]}'
    ```
6. Registrar accepts property registration request by Ashlesh. 
    From registrar cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.registrar:approvePropertyRegistration"",""001""]}'
    ```
7. Ashlesh lists his property for sale. 
    From user cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.user:updatePropertyStatus"",""Ashlesh"",""12345"",""001"",""onSale""]}'
    ```
8. Harshit recharges his account with 500 propCoins. 
    From user cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.user:rechargeAccount"",""Harshit"", ""54321"", ""txn500""]}'

    ```
11. Now there is no property under Ashlesh‚Äôs name. So, when Ashlesh tries to view the property, he gets the error. 
    From the user cli tab -
    ```sh
    $ peer chaincode invoke -o orderer.property-registration-network.com:7050 -C registrationchannel -n regnet -c '{""Args"":[""org.property-registration-network.regnet.user:viewProperty"",""Ashlesh"",""12345"",""001""]}'

![dubai](https://www.costacroisieres.fr/content/dam/costa/costa-asset/c_037/place/costa-crociere_dubai-e-emirati.jpg.image.750.563.low.jpg)

It is well known that Dubai has experienced exponential growth over the last 30 years: both in terms of population and construction. 
In fact, only 10% of Dubai's population is indigenous: 90% is made up of immigrants, a large proportion of whom are construction workers.

The aim of this project is to build a basic interactive application to explore the development of the Dubai real estate market from 1995 to 2020.

The application is developed entirely in the R language, with the R Shiny graphical interface.

To open it locally, just run the script [dubai_real_estate_app.R](dubai_real_estate_app.R) in R Studio, while on the server it is uploaded [here](https://albertomonari.shinyapps.io/real_estate_dubai/).

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andresgtn/dubai-real-estate-transactions) used is freely available on Kaggle.

The application offers two graphs showing the price trend and the price per square metre over time. The user can modify various parameters such as the neighbourhood of Dubai, 
the property type, the property subtype, the payment procedure,  whether or not the property purchased already existed, the range of time and the range of square metres.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

RaulSimpetru,RentVisualiser,,https://github.com/RaulSimpetru/RentVisualiser,https://api.github.com/repos/RentVisualiser/RaulSimpetru,An experiment to see how you can make an interactive matplotlib plot,"# RentVisualiser
This is a python script that can produce an interactive matplotlib plot in order to visualize rental property in a city.  
The properties are shown as dots of varied sizes and colors based on the average size and price form the given data. 

The script takes a .csv file as an input. The file must contain 4 columns: **Rent** (the price for the property for a month), **Area** (the size of the property), **Name** (can be left out but must be present as a column => use ;; ... it can help to identify the property) and **Address** (exact address - use google maps or something)

At the start, the script will ask if you would like to provide one or more orientation points like in New York the Statue of Liberty or something like that. You also must add the exact address (google maps can help)
### Prerequisites
pandas, geocoder, numpy, matplotlib
### Example
I have provided a test file called data.csv which holds fictive information but can be used to see the script in action

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **DISCLAIMER:** This project is only for education purpose.

### Why this project?

I am working on a real estate project. So I need real-time data for that so I write a program to gather the data for this project and convert it into a web-app using streamlit.

Check out my Data Analysis on the scrapped data [here](https://github.com/arv-anshul/campusx-project-notebooks).

### Techs

1. Python>=3.11
2. Asynchronous Programming
3. Streamlit
4. Http Requests
5. Pydantic

### Setup

1. Install all the required packages.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Run the streamlit app.

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Goto URL `http://localhost:8501/`.
3. Fill the form: **Select the city** which you want to scrape and submit.
4. After some backend processing; **a download button** will appear, click it to download the scrapped data.

### Disclaimer

As I wanted to scrape the data from 99Acres website. I am ensuring that I am not performing any illegal activity using this data. I used this data in my project to build some ML model and perform some data analysis.

> A real estate website for FirstGalaxy.inc to display the benefits of joining the company, helpful resources to start a real estate career, as well as how to get in touch with agents within the company to find listings.

The code is a demonstration of how to filter data. The first line imports the agents object from the ./data.js file. The next line declares that we are using strict mode, which means that all variables must be declared before they are used. The third line gets the element with id myDropdown and sets it as a variable named filterOptions. Next, we create an event listener on the filter button, which listens for when the button is clicked and then calls toggle() on filterOptions to show or hide its classList property depending on whether it's showing or hiding at this time in order to change what content is shown in our drop-down menu.

The code starts by importing the glossary module from a file called data.js, which is in the same directory as this code. The next line of code creates an empty div with id parent-container and sets its children to be an array that contains all of the terms in the glossary. Next, for each term in the glossary, it iterates through all of its children and adds them to another array called term_container. Finally, it loops through all of those arrays (term_container and parent-container) and prints out each one on separate lines so you can see what's going on better.

## Problem Statement addressed:

PropGraph: Find undervalued and comparable properties using graph-based relationships powered on TigerGraph.

Going after the TigerGraph Graph For All Million Dollar Challenge.

### Presentation

<!--
PropGraph: A property graph database.
Template: https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/graph-for-all-submission-template
 -->



**Description**:


With real estate at a recent all time demand high, the need for determining valuations effectively is important as ever. Often comparables for real estate valuation are derived at the discretion of the real estate agent, or simply based off the zestimate or redfin estimate for a property.

These methods can also be extremely opaque - with little to no visibility into the exact parameters that influence the price.

When an agent picks comparables, often this goes one layer deep - ex: the property is compared to three adjacent properties.

PropGraph provides a graph based solution that allows querying a given property and finding deeper relationships against recently sold properties. With PropGraph, you can take many 1-layer graphs (ex: one agent doing a comparable on a property) and go N layers deep instead by mapping across all comparables shared by multiple agents. With this strategy you can compare a property in Boston to a property that recently sold in the UK for example via a transitive graph  that previously wasn't visible.

Key graph elements:

- Descriptive words (renovated, new kitchen, new bathroom, flooring, etc.)

Standard quantitative fields:

- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Square footage

- Relationships between different property keywords.
- Find corresponding properties based on graph relationships matching multiple criteria simultaneously.
- Helps reduce bias in real estate pricing.
- Ingests and graphs data through several mainstream real estate websites, including Redfin, Zillow, and Trulia.
- Creates a valuation and visualization model in real time and serves it to the front end application.

## Data

Example dataset in `./data/sample.csv`.
More could be exported in basic searches from Redfin (redfin.com).

## Technology Stack:

- ReactJS
- Python
- pyTigerGraph

## Dependencies

State any dependencies and their versions needed to be installed to test this project. This may include programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and etc.

## Installation

Clone this repo and follow the steps below for the backend and frontend configuration locally.

### Structure

`./propgraph`: Client-side code.
`./server`: Jupyter notebook to configure the graph DB and backend server code.
`./data`: Example property data.
`./img`: Example screenshots of the application.

#### Backend

1. Set up a tigergraph cloud instance at tgcloud.io, set the credentials to access that instance via the following environment variables.

<pre>
    TIGER_HOST={YOUR_TIGERGRAPH_HOST}
    TIGER_USER={YOUR_TIGERGRAPH_USER}
    TIGER_PW={YOUR_TIGERGRAPH_PASSWORD}
    TIGER_TOKEN={YOU_TIGERGRAPH_TOKEN} # optional, fetched at runtime if unset.
</pre>

2. To bootstrap base/empty graph for PropGraph, run a jupyter notebook from the `./server` directory and open `graphsetup.ipynb`. Install dependencies in first cell and run all cells below.
3. `chmod 755 run.sh`
4. Run `./run.sh`

The server should now be running on port 8000.

### Bootstrap the Database

You'll want jupyter to run the DB-setup commands.
From the `./server` folder:
`jupyter-notebook` (or lab).

Run the commands to the end; if successful, the graph should be a created and a few sample queries should execute.

#### Frontend

From the `./propgraph` folder:

<pre>
yarn
yarn start
</pre>

The PropGraph frontend should now be running on port 3000.

You'll want to load up the DB with some properties from the 'Upload' page of the app to begin using PropGraph with your Tigergraph database.

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

- Include in-app visualization for comparable graph (currently capture-able in the notebook for further/future analysis)
- In-app search

## Reflections

Tigergraph has a unique value prop to do 'Nth' comparable level queries against properties to yield deeper insight than what could easily be done with a traditional database.

saklis,property-manager,,https://github.com/saklis/property-manager,https://api.github.com/repos/property-manager/saklis,"Configuration tool, which automatically finds and sets any fields or properties based on provided data.","# Property Manager
A configuration tool, which automatically finds and sets any fields or properties based on provided data. It comes bundled with providers to read and write ini files as well as pair of simple interfaces to let you easily write your own.

## Features
* Can set values of fields and properties using Reflection.
* Supported types: bool, int, float, string
* Supports static variables.
* Option to save changes through editable data provider.

## Compatibility
* C# 7.0 and greater

## Installation
With Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager: `PM> Install-Package PropertyManager`

or download library from https://www.nuget.org/packages/PropertyManager/

## Getting started with Property Manager
Most common way of using Property Manager is by invoking static API of `PropertyManager` class. This is used for batch application of all values.

### Applying values through static call
When you get used to it, applying values through static call is quite easy:
```c#
PropertyManager.Apply(this, new PropertyProvider.FilePropertyProvider(""fileWithValues.ini""));
```

This one line is a bit deceptive, though, as it does have quite a bit of things happening. Two main topics are Context and providers.

### Providers
Providers are classes implementing `IPropertyProvider` or `IEditablePropertyProvider` interface. The job of a provider is to supply Property Manager with List of `PropertyEntry` objects through implementation of `GetPropertyEntries()` method. Aditionally, `IEditablePropertyProvider` provides `Save()` method, which should be used to saving changes done through Property Manager.

Propery Manager by default contains two providers - `FilePropertyProvider` and `FileEditablePropertyProvider` which implement simple support \*.ini files with line-long comments.

An example of `fileWithValues.ini` file:
```ini
private field id = 42
Name = ""Adams""

# Is Adams user of our system?
IsUser = true
```

You may notice that there are two qualificators before `id` variable. Each variable is, by default, treated as public property, so if you're trying to set a private property or a field you need to add proper qualifier.

You can create and configure both providers using an initializer. Here's an example based on `FilePropertyProvider` class:
```c#
var provider = new FilePropertyProvider(""fileWithValues.ini"") {
  CommentSign = ""#"",
  Encoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8,
  Culture = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
  AllValuesAsString = false
};
```

Methods `GetPropertyEntries()` and `Save()` in the providers are for internal use for Property Manager and don't need to be called manualy.

### Context
Context is a starting point for Property Manager from which the system will look for fields and propertis.

Check out this example that expands on static call line from above:
```c#
class User {
  private int id;
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public bool IsUser { get; set; }
    
  public User() { }
}

internal class Program {
  private static void Main(string[] args) {
    User userObject = new User();
    
    PropertyManager.Apply(userObject, new PropertyProvider.FilePropertyProvider(""fileWithValues.ini""));
  }
}
```

The context of the call is userObject object, which means that all lines from the files will be applied to this userObject object. In this example after the calls of `Apply()` method values stored in userObject object will be 42, ""Adams"" and true for id, Name and IsUser respectively.

This approach, while quick and convinient, is a read-only approach. To make full use out of editable providers you'll need...

### Instance of Property Manager
Creating an editable instance of Property Manager is as strightforward as any other class.

```c#
var manager = new PropertyManager(new PropertyProvider.FileEditablePropertyProvider(""fileWithValues.ini""));
```

A Property Manager instance give you access to `Apply()` method that can be used exactly the same way as the static version. Aside of that, you can also use `GetValue()` method or indexer to retrive value from particular key.
```c#
string name = manager.GetValue<string>(""Name"");
string sameName = manager[""Name""];
```

### Editable values
To change value under key you can use `SetValue` method.
```c#
manager.SetValue<string>(""Name"", ""Duglas"");
```

And to update source file just call `Save()` method that's provided by the instance.
```c#
manager.Save();
```

## Concurrency
Property Manager is thread-safe in non-editable mode. It's no when editable provider is used.

# The insights: 
1. Chamberi, Tetuan and Chamart√≠n are adjacent districts. Together, they have the 18.03% of flats on sale and 26,6 % of renting flats. A location between the three districts will be suitable. 
2. The neighborhoods with the highest number of apartments for sale and renting are Center (Sol) and Salamancas. The price per meter is expensive in both locations, the hypothesis is that these areas have not a regular turnover. This hypothesis needs to be validated with other kind of data. 
3. Carabanchel and Puente de Vallecas are two areas with potential but the average squared meters and the number of rooms are smaller than the same values in the above districts.

# Steps of this project: 
1. Select one of the top real estate web sites in Madrid:
   URL: www.fotocasa.es
2. Design and preparation of the projects.
3. Web Scraping all rent and sale apartments in Madrid center. 
4. Clean the data. 
5. Import the data to MySQL Workbench.
6. Analyze the data.
7. The insights

# Design and preparation of the project: 
1. I have used Miro to create a visualization of the data I need to get from website. Here the Miro link: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lT6lKyU=/
2. I have used Trello as a productive tool to register the requirements needed to the project. https://trello.com/b/jU4yORwC

# Web Scrapping:
After the analysis www.fotocasa.es I have seen that the website is API based.
1. Check if the request to the site web is allowed (get 200).
2. Find the right headers of the site. 
3. Create a function to iterate through the different pages and recollect all the data in two json files. One for selling apartments and another for renting apartments. I've got around 18000 rows and 58 columns of selling apartments and 2300 rows and 8 columns of renting apartments.

# Clean the data: 
1. Get rid of the duplicated rows. I have discovered that half of the flats for selling where duplicated. So, I finalized with 9000 rows of selling flats.
2. The json files were dictionaries oriented and I have normalized all the dictionaries to extract all the values related to the Price, Squared meters, Rooms, Location, terrace, parking, elevator, description of the announce and the links of the flat pictures.
3. I have dropped all the unnecessary columns.
4. I have searched the outliers through boxplot, IQR and Z-Score.
5. I have removed the extreme values. 
6. I have created a new column with the price per squared meter. 
7. Same process for the Rent apartments. 
8. Export the files to CSV. 

# Import to MySQL
1. Create a new schema. ""Madrid""
2. Import table sale
3. Import table rent.
4. I have prepared some queries in MySQL Workbench to be used in the analysis of the data. 

# Analyze the data.
1. I've analyzed the places were the business competition has some locations in the center of Madrid. 
2. I have imported to Jupyter notebook the tables and I've filtered and group them base on Qty of apartments, neighborhood, price, surface, rooms and percentage of apartments per districts.

# Conclusions: 
Based in the data and the analysis of the real state current situation. An adjacent location between Chamberi, Tetuan and Chamartin will be the most suitable location to open a PopUpStore for the furniture retailer.

Store application properties along with their documentation in a neat Markdown file and load them using this library.

## Intention

Comments in property files tend to be not that appealing to the eye. The main reason is the lack of possibilities
to format the text written in these files. A different approach would be to write a separate documentation supporting
these features, which has the downside, that the location and prescense of these files needs to be known by users and developers.

The question is: Why should a property file not be configuration and well-readable documentation at the same time?
Markdown supports a easy-to-learn and powerful way to write nicely formatted text. Storing, reading and configuring
properties could be done with any text editor.

For a small example and giving you an idea of what this project is about you can view the project's
[Example Properties](examples/example-properties.md) file.

### TL;DR

> Storing documentation and the property values in one file (which supports text formatting) saves the developer
> and the user time and configuration errors.


## Usage

This library is written to support the `CommonMark` Markdown specification.

### Markdown Layout

To embed your property configuration inside a Markdown file you specify a code block like this:

	```property:here.goes.the.property.key
	And here goes the value
	```

For a more detailled example you can view the [Example Properties](examples/example-properties.md)

### Loading Properties

Loading Properties in your code can then be done like this:

```java
Properties mdProperties = new MarkdownProperties();
mdProperties.load(ClassLoader.class.getResourceAsStream(""/example-properties.md""));
```

You may notice `MarkdownProperties` extends `java.util.Properties` and can be used like a ""normal"" `Properties` instance.

### Storing Properties

Storing Properties is not supported by this library. Calling `store` or `storeAsXML` methods will behave like the standard `Property` class methods.

## Get it

You can get the library via Maven

```xml

## About

This project was conducted as a bachelor thesis research and the repository was created to show some snippets of the research.

## Abstract

Predicting the behaviour of the housing market has always been a challenging task of great significance since real estate affects the whole economy and individuals to a profound extent. This thesis explores the different aspects that impact the demand for real estate properties, focusing on Austrian real estate listings advertised online. The properties are mainly described by physical characteristics such as the price, area or the number of rooms. These are the primary variables used in this research to predict the real estate demand measured as the number of users expressing interest in the given property through an online platform. The secondary part of the research explores the macroeconomic factors that influence the housing market based on the available literature.
Machine learning methods are implemented for predicting the demand using four models: OLS regression, regression trees, random forests, and XGBoosted trees. Furthermore, different types of division regarding geographical hierarchy are specified in the models to see how well the details about the location contribute to the performance of the models.
The results suggest that random forests with Austrian states as the location specification perform the best in the purchase and rental segments. The crucial influences in the rental segment are the price per square meter and whether the listing was advertised privately. On the other hand, while the price per square meter also matters in the purchase segment, factors such as the online duration of the listing and the Covid 19 pandemic appeared to play a substantial role in this segment.

Blog linked below explores the underlying racial and socioeconomic disparity evident in Seattle's housing.","# *King County Housing Prices: Linear Regression For First-Time Buyers*
**Steven Zych - July 2020**

# Introduction

This project looks at housing prices in King County, Washington--which includes Seattle, Bellevue, Renton, Tacoma, and a handful of smaller cities and countryside. Housing data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction), manipulated and cleaned in Python as a Pandas dataframe, and ultimately modelled in an iterative approach using StatsModels and Scikit-learn.

More specifically, this project looks at best choices for first-time buyers in the Seattle area, and aims to answer the question:
> ""What factors bring down the price of a house the most, with least impact to overall quality?""

Obviously, this is a fairly subjective question, but categories will be posited later that aim to answer which variables count as having ""least impact"" on the quality of a home.

All in all, the following packages were used:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- StatsModels
- Scikit-Learn
- Warnings
- Datetime

# EDA and Cleaning 

## Column Names

The first (and perhaps most important) part of cleaning this data was sorting through the columns, identifying their meaning, and determining their usefulness to the project. The full list is as follows:
`['id', 'date', 'price', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'waterfront', 'view', 'condition', 'grade', 'sqft_above', 'sqft_basement', 'yr_built', 'yr_renovated', 'zipcode', 'lat', 'long', 'sqft_living15', 'sqft_lot15']`
Columns with `15` at the end refer to the values for the nearest 15 neighbors, waterfront is a yes-no column of whether or not you're on it, and view *claims* to represent whether or not the home has been viewed, yet the values range from 0-4. (Almost every value was 0, and this column was later dropped.)

## Data Types, Duplicates, And Missing Values

The `date` column was changed from strings to datetimes, `sqft_basement` was purged of an erroneous `?` value in many of its rows, and `date` was further manipulated into being represented as `day_of_year` (1-365) so that the model could use it better for predictions (as opposed to interpteting `02-15-2011`, for example).

There were no fully-duplicated rows in the data that needed to be expunged, but there were 117 rows with duplicate ID's--likely homes that were resold. These rows were dropped from the data as they represented only 0.01% of it.

The columns `waterfront` and `yr_renovated` contained thousands of missing values each, both sets of which were replaced with the most likely outcome--0. This indicated ""Not on the waterfront"" and ""Never been renovated"" respectively.

With the data cleaned, a baseline model could be built.

# Baseline Model

The first model takes all the data as-is, and uses every non-price column to predict the `price` column. No special modifications made, just plain and simple. The model's R-squared value was **0.692.** For the uninitiated, an R-squared value of **1** would mean that the linear regression model matches onto the predicted value (`price` here) *perfectly.* This is pretty unheard of. The next key metric, RMSE (root mean squared error, or, give-or-take how far off the model's guesses are) is **$213,446.**  For a baseline model however, the R-squared of 0.692 is *not bad,* but we *can* do better. The following models aim to do just that.

![Scatter Plot Of Predicted And Actual Price For Baseline Model](/readme_images/model_base.PNG)

# Model 2: Mean Normalization of Continuous Variables

For this model I first sorted out the continuous variables from the categorical ones. The continuous variables were `['price', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'floors', 'sqft_basement', 'yr_built', 'lat', 'long', 'sqft_living15', 'sqft_lot15', 'day_of_year']`. For each of these variables, a histogram was plotted to observe whether or not the data showed a normal distribution. In this case, only `['price', 'sqft_living15', 'sqft_living']` were deemed ""normal enough,"" and the remaining columns were all mean-normalized (transformed such that their means were now 0, and their minimums and maximums were roughly -1 and 1 respectively).

This model produced a dip in R-squared, down to **0.689,** and I suspected it may have been due to outliers in the data affecting the mean normalizations. Take a look at this plot to further see what I mean. Those lonely dots far down to the left are our price outliers, multi-million-dollar homes whose mere presence in the data throws the model into a tailspin.

![Scatter Plot Of Predicted And Actual Price For Mean Model 2](/readme_images/model_cont_var.PNG)

This impacted the RMSE of the model ever so slightly, bringing it down just a hair to **$213,306.** That's still a pretty massive margin. The subsequent models attempt to address these concerns.

# Model 3: Removing Outliers

It wasn't just `price` that had some extreme outliers. The columns `['price', 'bedrooms', 'sqft_lot', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_basement', 'sqft_lot15']` all had outliers as well (I'm looking at *you,* house with 33 bedrooms). Rows containing an outlier in any of these columns were dropped, and the model was reran with everything else unchanged.

It produced an R-squared value of **0.693** and and RMSE of **$137,906.** This was a considerable improvement on RMSE, and teh R-squared returned to where it was in the baseline.

![Scatter Plot Of Predicted And Actual Price For Model 3](/readme_images/model_remove_outlier.PNG)

# Model 4: Categorical Variables As Dummies

This model was based on the previous model, and involved data manipulation opposite that in model 2. IN other words, I focused on organizing the *categorical variables* in the dataset. Things like `condition`, `grade`, and `waterfront` that were either a binary category or didn't make sense on their own. (A grade of 3 has no meaning when abstracted from whatever rubric it's based on. Is it good? Bad?)

In short, the variables `condition` and `grade` were made into multiple columns of dummy variables (with the first column dropped of course) and `zipcode` was replaced altogether by sorting `lat` and `long` variables into 4 city sectors, where their converging point sits just south of Mercer Island.

This produced a bump in R-squared, up to **0.721** (which can be expected when we're adding so many variables to the model) and an RMSE of **$133,961.** The R-squared was definitely better, and the RMSE hardly changed. This model was kept moving forward.

![Scatter Plot Of Predicted And Actual Price For Model 4](/readme_images/model_cat_vals.PNG)

# Model 5: Selective Predictors

Unsure of a novel change to apply to the data, I modelled it with a twist: I only fed in a variable if its coefficient in the model was at least 6 digits long. In other words, I only modelled that which had a massive impact on price. I though this would strengthen the model, but it didn't at all. R-squared was dropped to **0.675** (worse than the baseline) and RMSE was brought back up some to **$144,649.** Seeing no significant value to this model, it was scrapped. It did, however, produce interesting clumping in the prediction data (as seen in the horizontal clouds below). I did not have time to investigate this behavior.

![Scatter Plot Of Predicted And Actual Price For Model 5](/readme_images/model_selected_predictor.PNG)

# Model 6: Only P-Values Under 0.05

This final model was based on model 4, and was mostly born out of the premise that none of your model's predictors should have a p-value over 0.05. It performed similarly to model 4, with an identical R-squared of **0.721** and a slightly-higher RMSE of **$135,925.** Seeing as this model was effectively the same as the previous best model, and it showed reduced complexity from dropping those low-p-value columns, it was kept, and bestowed the honor of **final model.**

![Scatter Plot Of Predicted And Actual Price For Model 6](/readme_images/model_p_above_005.PNG)

# Recommendations

After iterating through all these models, we return to the initial question:
> ""What factors bring down the price of a house the most, with least impact to overall quality?""

I've done the dirty work behind the scenes, and can offer you this summary. The following conditions all have *negative* correlations with price, meaning that if they are met, that house will be a  better deal. Here's what to do:

1. **Buy south of Mercer Island,** which puts you outside of the downtown region, into sectors 3 and 4.
1. **Buy where the neighbors have big yards.** Generally, these homes are in less urban areas (again, not downtown) and consequently can spread out. This is based on `sqft_lot15`.
1. **Buy new within reason.** Interestingly enough, `yr_built` has a negative correlation with price as well. Many older homes may be prized for their more aesthetic architecture or history.
1. **Don't get a basement.** This one surprised me, but basement-having correlates positively with price, so.
1. **Don't live on the waterfront,** but you should know that.

# Future Research

When next I aid first-time buyers in house-hunting in the greater Seattle area, I'd like to devote more time to feature-engineering and/or data-scraping, to get a better assessment of location's effect on price, especially proximity to areas of high cultural significance.

In this research, the only spatial data points used to predict price were latitude and longitude which--while salient--only provide broad strokes of information. Predicting instead by zipcodes and aggregated zipcodes (such that they represent whole neighborhoods, suburbs, and discrete cities) would potentially be a greater predictor of price since similar areas would be grouped with similar areas. In other words, the reputation of ""living in Renton"" vs. ""living in Bellevue,"" whatever that may mean, would be more present in the data when these spatial groups are recreated in it.

Two final spatial considerations would be proximity to cultural institutions and main streets. Does living next to Pike Place Market drive the price of your house up? What about the Olympic Sculpture park? How about if you live on Pine Street near all the cool restaurants? Intuition says ""Yes"" to all these, but the data has yet to speak.

# Conclusion

Thank you for lending me your time and consideration, and--more importantly--your trust. It is my sincere hope that the predictions and models set forth in this paper are beneficial to all the first-time buyers reading. Happy house hunting!",0,0,0,0,real-estate,"[house, linear-regression, machine-learning, real-estate]",0

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Before...

I invite you to download this project locally to be able to use the prediction functionality by running the ""Regression.ipynb"" and using the comments relating to predictions in ""Project.py"". 

## Objectif

The objective of this project is to create a Streamlit application on the open data ""Demandes de valeurs foncieres"" obtained on the government site.

The visualizations used in this project allow the user to quickly obtain all the essential information about this dataset.

The ability to search on the ID is offered to the user.

The strong point of this project is the possibility of making a prediction according to certain criteria to obtain the land value. The model used is the one coded in ""regression.ipynb"" which is an ExtraTrees. 

The project is NOT focused on Machine Learning so the model is NOT accurate!

# üìñ SuperHeroes <a name=""about-project""></a>

Website developed for ""Inmobiliaria Z√∫niga y Asoc."" a real state agency, integrating analytics, cookies (for storing the user preferences), and politics. 
I implement tools from Firebase like hosting, storage, and firestore database. I built an appointment scheduling tool and a tool for making quotes. The quotes tool allows the user to know which projects and properties can buy just by entering his average salary.

IntersectionObserver API was used to set the menu bar size depending on the scroll of the user because adding the 'scroll' event listener to the window consumes too much resources.
Cookies were used to store user preferences related to the webpage interface. 

As my first big project for a company, I focused on improving the loading time and SEO. I optimized the code as much as possible and minified every document to improve performance.

# Notiflat

This small Node.js tool written in TypeScript allows users to receive instant notifications (currently Telegram only) for new real estate listings on online platforms (currently German ""eBay Kleinanzeigen"" and ""WG-Gesucht.de"").

## Usage
- Use Node.js version 16 or above
- Set your configuration options in `src/config.json`
	- Provide a Telegram bot HTTP token and chat IDs to send the notifications to (https://core.telegram.org/bots#how-do-i-create-a-bot). When not providing Telegram data, only unformatted output will be sent to console.
	- Provide search query URLs (the address of the search results page) for the services and search filters you want to be notified of. Make sure they are sorted by newest listings first. Examples are already setup.
	- Use the `detailed` option to allow an extra HTTP request to fetch extended data of a listing.
- Start the tool:
```shell
npm install
npm run start
```
- While the script is running, notifications will be sent to the specified Telegram chats.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

![Securely share your family's get-away and memories](little-cabin-meta.png)

### Little Cabin is a single web app that provides multiple management tools such as:

- Shared Group Calendar
- Private Social Media Network
- Collaborative To-Do List
- Info Center

## Project Planning

My initial planning started by writing out my user stories, and conceptually working through all of the actions I personally had wished I could do in an app to help manage our family's camp.

_As A User (Not Logged In) I Want To:_

- View information about the app itself, and understand why I would want to make an account for an existing managed property, or use the app for my own property
- View app in a variety of themes (dark, light, eventually forest, beach, mountain, etc)

_As An Authorized User I Want To:_

**Account**

- Register a new account, and be automatically pre-approved based on an admin ""whitelist""
- Log in to my existing account, using the email address I registered with
- Log out of an account
- View the current weather conditions at my family property

**Postcards**

- View existing postcards, with the most recent at the top
- Create a new postcard (greeting and message)
- Upload a photo to my postcard
- Delete one of my existing postcards
- Edit one of my existing postcards

**Calendar**

- See existing property schedule as list
- See integrated Google Calendar to allow syncing to personal calendar
- Offer to swap one of my weeks for another family's week

**Requests**

- Add a request
- Mark a request as completed
- Hide completed tasks
- See completion progress of my requests and all requests in the last year

**Info**

- View emergency, legal, and other information about the property
- View nearby business info
- View my family tree

**UI/UX**

- Report a bug to the property admin
- View app on a variety of devices responsively

**Stretch Goals**

- Log in using Facebook, Google, etc
- Signup for notifications (text, email) when actions occur such as a request for one of my weeks is made, or a family member reacts to one of my postcards
- Sort the businesses by family recommendations, dynamically load via API
- Recommend a business on the list
- Upload a photo for my leaf of the tree
- ""Agree"" with an existing request to prioritize it
- Offer one of my weeks up for sale
- Request to purchase another family's week
- Add an emoji reaction to someone's post

### Structure

After the stories were in place, I categorized those stories, leaving me with the general navigation structure of the entire site and its pages. The Home page (not logged in) would display info mainly about Little Cabin, the app. All other pages would be private and only available if logged in; those would display and manipulate information about the property itself.

### Open Access Pages (Not Logged In / Unauthorized Users)

- Home
  - About (Public info about Little Cabin App)
- Login
- Register

### Authorized Access Pages

- Postcards
- Calendar
- Requests
- App Info

### Wireframes

On [Chuck](https://github.com/chuckchoiboi)'s recommendation, I used [Mockflow](https://mockflow.com/) to quickly and easily sketch some initial wireframes for these main page views.

![Wireframe Mockup Images](wireframes.png)

### Pitch Deck

I then used Google Slides to create a [pitch deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wABAwaZubhI4hExwqxWG6zBW7y5OyL_w92NW8NEWQnM/edit#slide=id.gd480e80180_0_52) to present to my stakeholders, and receive their feedback on project scope, tech and design pattern suggestions, and field initial questions and concerns.

## Building

I intentionally started this project from the _user_ perspective; getting an attractive frontend built as quickly as possible (using Bootstrap) to help make the project ""real"" and inspire ideas for features at an early stage. In previous large projects I had started by building backend instead (API, and databases models), however using a new framework (Django) and new database (PostgreSQL) for this project meant it would be easiest to have the schema conceptually as complete as possible before starting to actually write to the database.

### ERD

To assist in developing the data models, I sketched an ERD (entity relationship diagram) to help visualize the way the various objects would interact. This working sketch also made it simple to conceptualize new features, and adapt the models' properties before committing them to database tables.

![Entity Relationship Diagram ERD](erd.svg)

### Style Guide

Since I was creating this project on my own, the function of my style guide was more to help me keep track of design and copy ideas that I liked, rather than to strictly guide team members on a unified style. The choices certainly evolved and shifted as the app expanded, but updating the guide as the ""source of truth"" was essential to the workflow, even when working alone. It saves time to be able to copy/paste HEX color codes, font styles, terminology and slogans, etc, and reduces executive function required to make all of those tiny decisions over and over.

### Colors:

![Hex Colors](colors.png)

Light Mode (default)

- white: #ffffff
- flash: #ffc107
- grey: #e1d7bc
- dark: #2c333a
- color: #29461a
- wood: #5e0b15

[data-theme='dark']

- white: #0c1445
- flash: #5c54a4
- grey: #f8e48b
- dark: #ffffff
- color: #4c408e
- wood: #6ab0f1

### Fonts:

- Main Text: Montserrat
- Accent Headings: Raleway

### Terminology

- **Property**: the family location and structure being managed. Might refer to a ""camp"", ""cabin"", ""lake house"", ""vacation home"", ""cottage"", or other regional terms
- **Request**: a ToDo-style item including maintenance requests, etc
- **Week**: the unit of time a particular user or users has exclusive access to the property
- **Postcard**: a social media post including a written note and an optional photograph

### Copy

- **Title**: Little Cabin App
- **Subtitle**: Securely share your family get-away
- **Tagline**: Make Memories, Not Spreadsheets
- **Summary**: Little Cabin is a single web app that provides multiple management tools such as:
  - A shared schedule with permissions-based week swapping and Google Calendar integration
  - A micro social media network allowing family members to share virtual ""postcards"" (short notes with accompanying photos uploaded from their device)
  - A collaborative list collecting requests from members on maintenance items, purchase ideas, and other helpful suggestions. Members can edit or complete anyone's request, hide completed tasks, and view real-time reports on task completion rates
  - A knowledge repository with helpful information including contact info for local businesses and emergency protocols, historical information about the property, a family tree to see members, and (coming soon) legal trust information, weekly chores, dues schedule, and more

## Tech Used

- Python
- Django
- HTML / CSS / Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL
- Amazon AWS
- Google Calendar API
- Google Cloud Service Account
- Open Weather API
- Random User API
- Heroku

### Django

I followed [my own blog post](https://blog.benhammond.tech/django-getting-started) to get a ""Hello World"" Django application running locally, and then again followed my post [part 2 to deploy to Heroku](https://blog.benhammond.tech/deploying-django-to-heroku). I wanted the simplest possible app deployed early, so that eventual troubleshooting would be easier to pinpoint.

## Accessibility

Following the ethos of ""accessibility is not a feature"", I am making an effort to improve my projects by making and keeping them accessible from the very start. I have _much_ to learn in this space, but to start I frequently run the Lighthouse report tool in Chrome Dev Tools. This is not a complete testing, but it helps with the lowest hanging fruit:

- including a brief, descriptive `alt` attribute to add alternate text to your `<img>` tags. For _decorative_ images (those which are simply aesthetic or redundant based on adjacent text) it is recommended to set `alt=""""` so that screen readers will know to skip it
- setting an `aria-label` attribute on any links or buttons that don't include descriptive text. In my case, the template's hamburger menu was an svg file, so it made sense to also label that image as `aria-hidden=""true""` to let the screen reader know it didn't need to interpret that graphic
- organizing your headings hierarchy (`<h1>`-`<h6>`); in general there should only by one `<h1>`, and all subheadings should be in order (e.g. don't skip `<h3>` by going directly from an `<h2>` to an `<h4>`)
- ensuring the color contrast every bit of text and its background is high enough to be read

## Testing

This project was my first experience integrating unit testing. I utilized Django's existing `test.py` file and created class-based tests which extend the `TestCase` class. This allowed me to use methods such as `assertEquals`, `assertGreater`, `assertLess`, and `assertIn` to test the returned values from some of my more ""pure"" functions that were handling the business logic. The first places I've added tests were in functions that access external API services including fetching weather info and generating random user information as part of my demo feature. Adding tests is always important, but is particularly so for 3rd-party data such as an API call where one isn't in control of the response object and the structure or typing could change without warning.

It became very clear in this process how important it is to keep your functions as small and focused as possible; in some cases it's difficult to add tests because my functions are too sprawling and touch too many parts of the code at once. My goal going forward will be to unitize the functions and write the tests alongside the functions, to keep ideas clear and extensible.

## Problems Solved

> This Section will be formatted and split off into multiple blog posts and tweets in hopes of savings fellow devs and future me from making the same mistakes

- Building the project from the user's perspective, i.e. getting a working frontend displayed as quickly as possible. integrating an existing design into an extensible Django base template
- integrating css variables (custom properties) with existing design to make future changes as simple as possible
- extending Django's `UserCreationForm`; requiring `first_name`, `last_name`, and `email`, and removing the field for `username`; actually presented `username` as **Email** to user for all account related services (Register, Login, etc), since all the solutions recommended creating a custom user model _before starting the project_..... too late.
- custom pagination (view one year at a time). sending value out from form btn into the views. saving fetched data in big chunk into db, and reading from there unless data is stale then refetching
- [Extending UserCreationForm](https://dev.to/yahaya_hk/usercreation-form-with-multiple-fields-in-django-ek9)
- use template filters to calculate previous and subsequent years for buttons and post request values. conditionally rendering ""previous year"" button to deny viewing past years.
- different colors of icon/favicon/logo
- Manually pivoting a table lookup; each Postcard contained an owner username, but I needed to get `first_name` and `last_name`; in the `view` method I looped through the postcards, and then built a context dictionary which contained a list of Postcards bundled with their User authors. This was I was able to easily access the Postcard info in the template using `{{ card.author.first_name }}`
- naming collisions: bug with view method named ""postcards"" and list of objects from the database ""postcards"". Also, named my to-do items ""Request"" objects, which is confusing with the built in request keyword from Django's HTTP request/response framework
- adding checkbox _inside_ the to-do item; required using `<button>` instead of `<input />` to place the svg graphic inside each generated form.
- todo list: conditional rendering of ""hide completed"" button; calculating completion rates in the view method and then sending through to display as progress bars.
- learned that Heroku config vars are ALWAYS strings, meaning when I had set `DEBUG` to `False` for production, it was actually reading the string `""False""` which it was evaluating as `True`. I was able to fix this by simply setting a different config var for development and production and then assign `DEBUG` as needed. This was resulting in a 500 Error; which took significant debugging to fix. First, followed [this stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52311724/500-error-when-debug-false-with-heroku-and-django) and set up detailed logging to discover the real issue that was causing the 500 error. It turns out it was a `ValueError: Missing staticfiles manifest entry for` one of my images. To remedy this error, I went into my terminal with the virtual environment activated, and ran `python3 manage.py collectstatic`. Still not entirely sure what this did, other than make copies of almost all of the images I had used in the project which increased my deploy and push times. But it basically hooked everything up image-wise for Django, and fixed the 500 error.
- Conditionally render the ""edit"" and ""delete"" buttons as accessible icons; even though the two variables were displaying the same, the current username was returning `False` when compared against the postcard owner. I was able to fix this by using a Django template tag to convert them to the same type of string `{% if card.postcard.owner|stringformat:""s"" == user.username|stringformat:""s"" %}`
- Needed to extend the builtin DeleteView class, and also to my detail function (for create and update) to lookup the Photo(s) that contained the currently detailed Postcard. This allowed all of these views to display the postcard along with its photos, even though the relationship is 1 POSTCARD->MANY PHOTOS, and therefor it's the Photo class that contains a Postcard foreign key. Had to overwrite the `get_context_data()` method to do the lookup, and then bundle those Photos into the returned `context`.
- Decided not to limit CRUD on the shared to do requests; this way anyone is able to edit an existing request (and fix a spelling error, or add details), complete a request, and then hide all complete requests. This only works since the view is for screened, authorized users. I decided to skip the pencil icon and instead make clicking the text of the request item the ""edit"" function, and then the complete/incomplete would be handled by the checkbox. I have some concerns that the way I've designed it might be less accessible than if I had relied on the browsers built-in check box.
- Make the postcards feel more ""real world"" by adding a tiny bit of random tilt to their display, and having them straighten and expand when hovering with mouse.
- Limit access to the app to users who have been approved; to do this I used the Group property of Django's built in User model. This creates a many-to-many relationship, and allows filter() and get() requests to the database to delegate functionality based on the group. I created a ""member"" group who's users have full create/read/update/destroy (CRUD) access to postcards, requests and weeks, and an ""admin"" group who's users will see and approve new member requests. Specifically, the admin `home` view queries the database for all users expect those who are already in the ""member"" group: `User.objects.all().exclude(groups__name='member')`, and then displays that list with associated ""approve"" buttons:
  ```django
  {% for pending_user in pending_users %}
    <li>
      <span>{{pending_user.first_name|title}} {{pending_user.last_name|title}} ({{pending_user.username}})</span>
      <a href=""{% url 'approve_user' pending_user.id %}"">Approve</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
  ```
- implementing Swap objects (pending offers to swap Week objects between Groups, initiated and approved by Users). LOTS OF STUFF. this was hard
- error after adding ""created""; used default value of `1` which didn't make sense, and wasn't able to run `migrate` even after dropping and recreating the db. Had to manually go into the migrations folder and alter the value of `default=1` to `default=django.utils.timezone.now`.
- setting up automatic creation of `owner_group`s in the db using a data migration.
- ordering my groups, decided to append a number so they were sortable
- avoiding name collisions; used `import calendar as calendar_lib` since I was already using `calendar` as a view method
- displaying a dropdown `<select>` with every pending user displayed to an admin; admin can then choose the correct owner_group and approve, or deny the user and delete the uncredentialed user. This was also complex; mainly in deciding between using Django's built-in form handling, and digging through obscure and tangential examples. I decided to implement it myself, changing my approve button from being an `<a>` to being a `<button>` inside of a `<form`>, and then adding a hidden `<input>` to contain the `user.id` . I also placed the `<select>` inside the same form, and then made `home/` intercept post requests and process the incoming data by finding the User, finding the Group, then adding the user to that group.
- ""Approve"" buttons stay disabled until the admin selects a Group; I
- calculating an end date required adding a dateTime delta of 7 days, and then rendering that dateTime as a string to be sent to Google API
- aligning automatically generated forms in Django; required displaying them as a table instead of `<p>` elements, and then adding my bootstrap classes to the table surrounding the template tag.
- adding a ""Demo Login"" button to allow people quickly just checking out the app to have a useable account and populated data from other auto-generated users. Not every person is going to create an account just to check out your little project, so making it as easy as possible to see what's behind the login screen
- adding a theme switcher; I adapted a light/dark mode tutorial to just adjust the colors. Eventually it would be great to have a lake theme, mountain theme, beach theme, and other relevant vacation vibes. The theme switcher relies on CSS variables which I was already using, so it would pretty quick to set up. It also records the user's preference in localstorage, so the theme persists between sessions. I learned several things throughout this process, including the benefits of naming your variables based on their role or context, rather than their general color. Also, learned how to place bootstrap color utility classes `bg-dark` on containing `<div>`s to cascade that color class to all the contained text elements(`<p>`, `<a>`, etc) rather than adding classes to every element
- I wanted a visual representation of the family, not only for the historical and social aspect, but also to represent to people viewing the app exactly how complicated managing so many user in sub-families can be. If I were building in React I would have created a dynamic, component based family tree, and I still may. But for now, I decided to just create a static image and to use the tree as an exercise in learning Figma, which I have recently been exploring.
- I wanted to let members view the current weather conditions at the property; this turned out to be significantly more involved than anticipated. I first need to make a call to the weather api, which was straightforward, particularly compared to the Google Calendar API. Next I needed a way of displaying the info, and settled on the side nav menu since it would be available on every page. However, the API is rate-limited and there would be no need to recall the API every time the page loaded, but instead every several minutes. To accomplish this, I created a model `WeatherReport` which stored the temp, conditions, and timestamp. Then, whenever the page is reloaded, it checked the freshness of the weather report in the database and repings the API as needed. Also significantly tricky was sending variable data (the weather conditions) to my `base.html` template which was providing my nav and footer for every page. To do this, I created another custom template tag (similar to how I was able to add anchor links partway down my home page). This allowed me to run the logic needed in a python file, and then call and retrieve the string answer in my template using `{% current_weather %}
- template I used has a slide-in side menu for smaller screen sizes, and by default the only way to close that menu (without clicking an item) is a tiny little ""x"" in the corner. Modern UX seems to trend towards clicking ""off the popup"" will work to close a menu, so I was able to understand how the template's JavaScript was working, and apply the same ` closeSidenavFunc()` in an event listener attached to the grayed out background that was covering the rest of the screen already.

This program uses machine learning to predict the tax depreciation rate and category when given an arbitrary text description of an asset/capital expenditure (capex).

## Goal

The goal is to achieve over 90% prediction accuracy in all scenarios.

[Currently](#validation-and-accuracy), it can achieve:
- 80%+ accuracy when text is similar in style to the training data regardless of small spelling errors, ordering of words, language variations (e.g. -ed, -ing, -s, etc).
- Only around 50% or less accuracy when the text is of a very different style to the training data.

Please feel free to contribute suggests, corrections, and training data.


# Problem to be solved - a brief background

In the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT / Property Funds) industry, real estate assets are held for investment purposes to provide income distributions to investors. A feature of Australian REITs for investors are non-taxable cash distributions which are primarily driven by tax deductible/depreciable capex.

Capex can result in various tax outcomes depending on the jurisdiction. In Australia, generally, depending on the nature of the cost, can be categorised and treated as: 

1. Immediately tax deductible; 
2. Depreciated as a tax asset over its effective life at [various](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?LocID=%22TXR%2FTR20184%2FNAT%2FATO%2FatTABLEB%22&PiT=99991231235958#TABLEB) depreciation rates; 
3. Be eligible for a building allowance deduction over 25 or 40 years; or
4. Added to the cost base of the asset to reduce the capital gain upon sale of the property.

An expert can be engaged to create a tax depreciation schedule (aka QS report) that breaks down costs into these categories. Industry practice is that this is usually done for high-value capex e.g. a property acquisition or major development project. However, a lot of the day-to-day capex is high-volume and low-value. This does not make it cost effective to outsource to an expert. As such, most businesses are classifying these items manually based on accounting system descriptions or invoices (or not at all and missing out on tax deductions). 

These manual processes, by nature of being high-volume and based on arbitrary descriptions, are time consuming; and by nature of being low-value, do not result in material errors if an item is misclassified. These attributes make this problem ideal for machine learning to solve.


# How does this program work?

While doing some machine learning exercises, particularly [this one](https://joaorafaelm.github.io/blog/text-classification-with-python), it occurred to me that this problem is essentially a text classification problem. Done manually, a person would read an arbitrary cost description from a cost report, like ""chillers for precinct A"", and then [look it up in the tables](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=TXR%2FTR20184%2FNAT%2FATO%2F00023) to find it's either 25 years or 20 years effective life depending on the type of chiller.

The machine learning model is built using training data (arbitrary text descriptions of capex) that has previously been reliably classified (tagged with a depreciation type/rate). Once the model is trained, text descriptions of capex can be fed in, and it will predict the tax attributes.

![workflow](img/ml_workflow.png)

The text is pre-processed to help the machine learning model find ""meaning"" in the text; rather than doing something more basic like string (word) matching, word length counting, etc. This means that the model can overcome small spelling mistakes, variances in ordering, and different forms of the same word (e.g. 'carpet' and 'carpeting' ""mean"" the same thing). This is vital to the usefulness of the model as it's designed to accept arbitrary text data to provide maximum flexibility in its usage. Further machine learning details [below](#some-machine-learning-details).

## Validation and accuracy

The trained model is tested by predicting results using other data with a known classification (testing data). The predicted classification is then matched against the known classifications in the testing data giving an overall accuracy %.

Using proprietary training data not included in this repo, a model was developed using 18,899 rows of training data which produced:

- 89.6% accuracy when using a random subset of the training data as testing data.
- 83.8% accuracy using K-Fold Cross Validation using 10 subsets (more thorough version of above).
- 92.3% accuracy when entirely tested against itself (artificially high).

This repo includes [generic training data](#training-data). It is developed from the Australian Tax Office [effective life tables](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=TXR/TR20184/NAT/ATO/00001) (run the `demo.py` included, and follow the instructions to run an accuracy report). It works ok for demo purposes.

I've found that using capex descriptions of a language style which is very different from the training data causes the accuracy to deteriorate rapidly. More on this [here](#further-improvements-in-the-works). As such, a model created using the included sample training data has limited flexibility in production.

## Future applications

The trained model can easily be used programmatically as part of a broader automated system. The goal is to have a workflow like:

1. Arbitrarily structured text can be fed directly into the model from the accounting system transaction descriptions, or other system/process that itemises the costs. This flexibility is the key reason for using machine learning vs another method that is more basic and reliable (but would require structured text inputs).

2. The text is classified using the machine learning model. 

3. The classification is combined with the original accounting system transaction data to generate the accounting/ERP system input file (e.g. journal entry) which would then be ingested into the tax depreciation module. 

## Further improvements in the works...

The training dataset has high reliability of having the correct classification, however, the text descriptions are of a single language style. By training the model with real world text descriptions (different styles of language) and offering feedback and corrections, the model's accuracy may be improved. 

Another thing to point out is that the model appears to bias towards classifications where there is more training data of a certain category. However, this is not necessarily a weakness. If the training data set is reflective of a business's actual depreciation register, the natural distribution of assets/capex purchased would be reflected in the predictions (e.g. it wouldn't be normal to have 1,000s of air conditioners for every 1 chair).

These issues can be seen in the accuracy reports when using K-Fold Cross Validation (validation/testing data is not used for training) resulting in low accuracy vs testing the data against itself (validation/testing data is the same as the training data) resulting in almost perfect accuracy.

I've found that using new training data (different language style, different descriptions) results in higher prediction accuracies. 

### Next iteration

My next experiment with this is to generate additional training data by finding synonym combinations and alternative expressions for the existing training data. This should overcome some of the language style issues. E.g. 'stamp duty' vs 'duty' vs 'duties' vs 'stamp' vs 'SD' vs 'stmp dty'.

Also, crowd-sourced training data can be gathered to further refine the model for real world text description. By making available a testing environment where a user can feed in their live examples from their existing, manual process, the user can manually flag and correct wrong predictions. This feedback data can be combined with the other training data for further refinement of the model. 

Ultimately, a lot of experimentation is required to see what works to achieve the [goal](#goal).

## Some machine learning details

In order to run machine learning algorithms on text based data like this, we need to transform the text into numerical values. Pre-processing this text is vital to the accuracy of the model.
 
Bag-of-words is one of the most used models for text. It essentially assigns a numerical value to words, creating a list of numbers.

Converting letters or words into numbers by e.g. counting frequencies of letters might not be enough. For example, long words or descriptions can bias the model because it is focusing on the assigned numerical value which really denotes length and not meaning.

Other problems relate to trying to extract ""meaning"" from words. Take for example the words ‚Äòcarpet‚Äô and ‚Äòcarpeting‚Äô. They would be considered different words under a strict numerical assignment. This problem can be solved with various methods e.g. we can group together the inflected forms of a word. For example, the words ‚Äòwalked‚Äô, ‚Äòwalks‚Äô and ‚Äòwalking‚Äô, can be grouped into their base form, the verb ‚Äòwalk‚Äô. Another issue worth noting is that some words despite the fact that they appear frequently, they do not really make any difference for classification because they don't change the meaning, and could even help mis-classify a text description. Words like ‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòan‚Äô, ‚Äòthe‚Äô, ‚Äòto‚Äô, ‚Äòor‚Äô etc, are known as stop-words. These words can be ignored during the machine learning process.

These issues and others are dealt with during the training of the model.


# Code usage info

The code is in `src/text_classifier_deprn_rates.py`. Once the `DeprnPredictor` Class has been instantiated, call the `predict_description(user_description)` method by feeding it some text to classify. Use a loop and call this method over and over again for each text description. 

The method returns two objects being:
1. A `pandas` Series object containing the various details of the tax category predicted.
2. An ""account"" description string matching how the training data labels its categories. This is basically a made up code for each possible tax category. See `src/account_meanings.csv` for a table showing the meanings. The reason for this design is that most accounting/ERP systems use something like this behind the scenes to drive the tax depreciation module. It can be anything so long as it matches the training data.

The `DeprnPredictor` Class is just a simple wrapper around some common machine learning libraries and techniques for classifying text data. It abstracts some of the fiddlier steps like pre-processing and building the pipeline. As a trade-off some bugs can occur due to how `pickle` is handled by the underlying ML libraries.

## Training data

Included in the repo is sample training data (`src/data_training/sample_training_data.csv`) based on the Australian Tax Office [effective life tables](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?DocID=TXR/TR20184/NAT/ATO/00001). 

I would note from experience that the accuracy of the predictions is highly dependent on good training data. This sample data creates decent results if the language used is very similar to it.

The best data to use would be actual descriptions of items from a REIT's fixed asset/depreciation register and underlying accounting transaction descriptions. Unfortunately, this data is proprietary to organisations unless donated to this repo.

However, I have some [ideas](#next-iteration) to generate some data.

git clone https://github.com/DannyGlade/Real_Estate_Site.git
```
4. Then cd into folder using below Command

cd Real_Estate_Site
```
> Note from here On, You can also use Terminal from VS Code or Your IDE...

### Install All Composer Dependencies
1. Use below command to install all dependencies then wait till all process is complete...
```bash
composer install
```

### Create a .env file
1. Duplicate *.env.example* as *.env* file
2. Fill information of your DB **username** and **password** & other info if needed...

### Create DataBase
1. Create DataBase by PhpMyadmin (provided by [Wamp](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)) or Any Other DB you use...
> Note DataBase name should be same as typed in *.env* file
### DataBase Structure

### Serve Project
1. Use below Command ( [Wamp](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)/Other Should be Runnig ) to run project...
```bash
php artisan serve
```
> if some *key* related error appears then use command `php artisan key:generate` to generate AppKey.

## Update Admin
Go to the Link that `php artisan serve` command gives you and Hopefully it should be working, I hope you are capable of any troubleshooting if any error occurs.

Admin site: `your_site_link/admin/dashboard`

- Admin Email
```bash
admin@admin.com
```
- Admin Password
```bash
admin123
```
Update CMS and Site Settings inside Admin Panel (/admin/dashboard) Once (empty or filled doesn't matter), and then goto frontend
> when project loads for first time db won't have values of CMS and Site setting, by updating those fields will be created, so frontend wouldn't show errors after that...

I am writing this documentaion while this project is still in making, because I was bored...

I will add more soon, If my mind says, lol...

If You are still reading, then Thanks and Welcome...

Hope My project helps you any ways...

This website uses HTML, SASS & Responsive Design.","# Real Estate Website - The-Modern-House

I created a fully responsive real estate website from viewing a UX/UI design online. This website uses HTML, SASS & Responsive Design.

## Lessons Learned

I really enjoyed the process of breaking down the UX/UI design into small chunks, via divide and conquer.
The lessons learned are below:

* Re-creating a website as close as possible to the design that was given to me. 
* (updating my knowledge on) Responsive Design.
* Adding favicon to a page. 
* Creating a website ASAP.

## Challenges 

* Updating my knowledge on responsive design.
* Making each section of the page have the height and width of the ui/ux mockup.

# What I'll do next time

* Try to adjust my responsive design skills

## Setup Guide :raised_hands:

### Python Environment Setup 

Make sure you have python 3.6 or newer installed on your computer. If so, clone this repository to your local computer.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Avishka-Shamendra/real-estate-project.git
$ cd real-estate-project
```

Then create a virtual environment to run the project in. The commands may change depending on the operating system you are using. For windows,

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Then install dependencies needed in the virtual environment

```bash
(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Check if following command prints the available command. If the installation is successful, this should not cause an error.

```bash
(venv) python manage.py
```

### Postgres Setup

Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) in the local machine and setup correctly. Use the following command to log in to the `psql` shell as `postgres` user.

```bash
$ psql -U postgres
```
Then create a new database and exit the `psql` shell

```bash
(psql) CREATE DATABASE btredb;
(psql) \q
```
### Django Setup

First, run the database migration and create the necessary tables. Make sure you are in the correct virtual environment. Whenever there is a database model change, you should re-run this.

```bash
(venv) python manage.py migrate
```
Then create the static files required for the project.

```bash
(venv) python manage.py collectstatic
```

Finally, create the admin user account. This will be the default admin user for the system. Give a preferred username and password.

```bash
(venv) python manage.py createsuperuser
```
Afterward, try running the project. The default URL for the admin is <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin>

```bash
(venv) python manage.py runserver
```

# FULL PROJECT:

- [x] [1. Web Scraping](#web-scraping)
- [x] [2. Data Cleansing](#data-cleansing)
- [ ] 3. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis (TBD)
- [ ] 4. Machine Learning Model (TBD)
- [ ] 5. Model Deployment (TBD)



## INTRO

This is my very first Python project developed to exercise **Python programming, Web Scraping and Machine Learning skills** that I've been developing in the last 18 months together with other tools.

It's comprised of 5 sections mentioned above and **ultimate goal** is to **recommend price for new houses advertisements** by considering its attributes such as constructed area, condominium where it's located, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of en suites and number of car spaces. That tool would be used to

This is intended to be the first of a series of projects that will also include machine learning models for forecasting, classification, recommendation and so on.

I'll also include information about Business intelligence projects that are already developed, including ETL processes.


## MOTIVATION

It's widely known that real life projects are quite more challenging than those we usually find in courses or dataset repositories. Thus the motivation is **to develop a simple yet original project** - not based on readly available datasets -, **from idea to deploy** as a mean to exercise, improve and show my ongoing Data Science skills.


## SUBJECT

Aldeia da Serra village, a suburban housing neighbourhood located 35km west from Sao Paulo city, Brazil. It's a place with about 10 housing condominiuns where people live close to Nature and not too far from workplace. Although traffic is usually heavy and it takes about 30' to get to Alphaville region and about 90' to Sao Paulo city.

As a motorcycle enthusiastic, it usually takes me about 45' to reach Sao Paulos's southern region. Yes, I live at Aldeia da Serra and for me the proximity to the Nature is worth the distance from workplace. Additionally, recent developments of Covid-19 has been acellerating the adoption and expansion of **work from home** modality among entreprises, which may decrease the necessity to commute on a daily basis.

Well, let's go to the project itself!



# WEB SCRAPING


### AIM

The aim of this project is to automate the collection of real estate advertisings from <a href= ""http://vivareal.com.br""> Viva Real </a> marketplace web site using web scraping technology in compliance with the site rules stated in the robots.txt file. 

<img src=""img/webscraping_vivareal_page.png"" width=""900"">

The following information will be extracted for each real estate:

1. address
2. title
3. area in square meters (m2)
4. number of bedrooms
5. number of bathrooms
6. number of car spaces
7. price asked
8. url

As you might have antecipated there are some data transformation to be done (e.g. to split the address into street name, street number and city) that will be addressed in the second phase of the project.



### CHALLENGES

* Several searches are needed to get all houses on sale at  Aldeia da Serra region because there are three cities in the region (Santana de Parnaiba, Barueri and Itapevi) and some houses are published under the name of the condominium.

* Asynchronus loading: Viva Real site was built with Java Script search results are loaded in two steps changing by number of houses in each step. It required more research.
 
 * It's my very first project using Python.



### SOLUTION

Note how the page is loaded the first time displaying the total number of advertisements and then it's loaded again with a different number and different items. The correct number is the displayed at the first time and the correct items to be scraped are displayed afterwards.

### FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS

* Get houses' descriptions to improve condo_name for adversiments without it.

* Get houses' attributes (e.g. swiming pool)

* Improve code by storing urls and page parameter to avoid code repetition.

* Use a ETL tool such as Airflow to automate the web scraping execution.

* Create a cloud database and add new house advertisements incrementally keeping
track of publication date.





# DATA CLEANSING


### AIM

To inspect and transform - clean, deduplicate, categorize and filter -,  the attributes scraped from Viva Real real estate market place in ways that it can be used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Model (ML) creation.



### CHALLENGES

1. House attributes scraped:

<img src=""img/webscraping_vivareal_page.png"" width=""900"">


2. The above attributes were extracted and recorded as below:

<img src=""img/cleaning_before.png"" width=""900"">
In blue are the attributes to be cleaned from the dust, in red.


3. The most challeging attribute is the Address that must be splitted into street_name, street_number, condo_name and city, because the records are not homogeneous. Actually, there are 4 different patterns that get to be addressed:

<img src=""img/cleaning_address.png"" width=""900"">



### RESULTS

Cleaning preparation:

<img src=""img/cleaning_preparation.png"" width=""900"">

The four patterns are prepared using separators to be correctly splitted:

1. street name | city
2. street name | street number| neighbourhood | city
3. street name | condo name | neighbourhood | city
4. street name | street number| condo name | neighbourhood | city


Expected resuls:

- street name | street number | condo name |  city

emisilve86,Parser-Automatico-Casedavedere.it,,https://github.com/emisilve86/Parser-Automatico-Casedavedere.it,https://api.github.com/repos/Parser-Automatico-Casedavedere.it/emisilve86,Lo script implementa un parser di annunci immobiliari presenti su casesavedere.it che pu√≤ essere automatizzato e che pu√≤ inviare messaggi di posta elettronica contenente l'anteprima degli annunci che soddisfano i criteri di ricerca impostati.,"# Parser Automatico di Annunci Immobiliari su Casesavedere.it #

----------

## Perch√©? ##

Molte applicazioni e motori di ricerca di annunci immobiliari gi√† offrono all'utente la possibilit√† di effettuare ricerche con filtri avanzati, per poi notificare puntualmente l'utente, tramite email e/o notifica *push*, dell'inserimento di nuovi annunci che soddisfano i criteri di ricerca inseriti. E' questo il caso dei ben noti `Idealista`, `Immobiliare.it`, `Casa.it`, ecc.

Ad ogni modo, sono solito consultare anche un'altra piattaforma sul Web molto utilizzata da privati e agenzie immobiliari che operano sul mio territorio. Si tratta di [`Casedavedere.it`](https://www.casedavedere.it/) che offre all'utente una semplice *form* di ricerca con alcuni campi quali, ad esempio, la provincia, il comune, il prezzo massimo, i metri quadri, e pochi altri criteri di base.

D'altro canto, questa piattaforma non permette di filtrare per <u>numero di locali</u>, <u>piani intermedi</u>, <u>presenza di box</u>/<u>garage</u>, <u>numero minimo di balconi</u> e <u>ascensore</u>. Alcune informazioni che vorrei poter avere filtrate nella mia ricerca, ma che attualmente √® possibile solo capire aprendo il *link* di ogni singolo annuncio presente nel risultato di una ricerca che include centinaia di anteprime distribuite tra decine di pagine da navigare in sequenza.

Inoltre, la piattaforma Web in questione non offre l'iscrizione ad alcun tipo di *newsletter* che possa permettere all'utente interessato di ricevere aggiornamenti in merito ai pi√π recenti annunci inseriti che soddisfino il filtro impostato. Ad aggravare tale carenza, c'√® poi la difficolt√† nel poter discernere i vecchi dai nuovi annunci, in quanto le anteprime delle ricerche effettuate non sono sempre presentate nello stesso ordine.

Per superare tali limitazioni, ho deciso di sviluppare uno *script* Python (>=3.6) che implementa un <u>*parser* con filtro avanzato</u> che pu√≤ essere facilmente configurato per esplorare gli annunci di immobili presenti in <u>pi√π di un comune e provincia</u>, e che permette di <u>ricevere notifiche tramite email</u> contenenti nel corpo le anteprime degli annunci immobiliari che soddisfano i criteri di ricerca inseriti, ma non ancora notificati in passato. Lo *script* pu√≤ essere quindi lanciato in modo programmatico come *task* di Cron per <u>eseguire automaticamente</u> in background ad intervalli di tempo determinati.

> **Nota**.
> Clonando questo repository viene clonato in locale tutto il sorgente necessario a lanciare il *parser*. In ogni caso, sar√† necessario seguire alcuni step fondamentali per preparare l'ambiente a funzionare correttamente e che viene spiegato nel seguito.

----------

## Come? ##

Come prima cosa, √® necessario verificare di avere installato Python3 sul proprio sistema. Sono poi necessari i seguenti moduli Python per poter lanciare lo script: `os`, `re`, `json`, `socket`, `validators`, `http`, `base64`, `datetime`, `bs4` e `email`.

Molti di questi saranno gi√† disponibili nell'ambiente base una volta installato Python, mentre altre dovranno essere installate manualmente, ad esempio, tramite il *package installer* di Python `pip`.

Inoltre, per permettere a questa applicazione di inviare le email in maniera programmatica, dovranno essere installati anche i seguenti moduli

> ```pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib```

Ad ogni modo, per utilizzare i servizi offerti tramite API Google, √® necessario creare prima un progetto Google Cloud Platform come spiegato a questo [link](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project), per poi creare anche le credenziali per applicazioni desktop come spiegato a questo secondo [link](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials). Quest'ultimo step √® indispensabile per l'autenticazione e quindi l'utilizzo dei servizi offerti tramite API di Google.

> **Nota**.
> Tenere bene a mente che, per poter inviare email sfrutando le apposite API, bisogna specificare i seguenti ambiti all'atto della creazione delle credenziali

> ```.../auth/gmail.compose```	--- *(Gestire le bozze e inviare le email)*

> ```.../auth/gmail.readonly```	--- *(Visualizzare le tue email e impostazioni)*

Una volta completati i passi descritti nei due link riportati sopra, sar√† possibile scaricare un file `credential.json` che deve essere inserito nella stessa directory dove risiede lo *script* `CaseDaVedere.py`.

A questo punto abbiamo tutto, e possiamo procedere con la configurazione vera e propria dell'applicazione. Dobbiamo innanzitutto specificare gli indirizzi di posta ai quali si desidera inviare le email. Per fare questo basta inserire uno o pi√π indirizzi di posta elettronica all'interno del file `email_list.json`, all'interno della lista puntata dalla chiave `""email""`, come mostrato sotto

> ```json
> ""email"" : [
> 	""esempio1@serv.it"",
> 	""esempio2@serv.it"",
> 	...
> ]
> ```

> **Nota**.
> Tenere presente che, se la lista rimane vuota, non verr√† generata nessuna email, ma sar√† sempre possibile consultare il file `casedavedere.html` che viene generato in maniera automatica dallo *script* e che contiene le anteprime di tutti gli annunci che soddisfano i criteri di ricerca impostati.

I campi da aggiornare per impostare il filtro desiderato sono tutti inclusi nel file `property_filter.json` che sono impostati di base a valori di default. Questi sono

> `min_area` : un valore intero che rappresenta la superficie minima in metri quadri dell'immobile

> `max_area` : un valore intero che rappresenta la superficie massima in metri quadri dell'immobile

> `min_price` : un valore intero che rappresenta il prezzo minimo di vendita dell'immobile

> `max_price` : un valore intero che rappresenta il prezzo massimo che si intende sborsare per l'acquisto dell'immobile

> `intermediate_floor` : un booleano da impostare con il valore 0 o 1 per escludere o meno dalla ricerca tutti gli immobili siti all'ultimo piano ed al piano terra

> `min_rooms` : un valore intero che rappresenta il numero minimo di locali di cui deve essere dotato l'immobile

> `min_balconies` : un valore intero che rappresenta il numero minimo di balconi di cui deve essere dotato l'immobile

> `need_box` : un booleano da impostare con il valore 0 o 1 per includere tra i risultati della ricerca solo gli immobili venduti insieme ad un garage/box auto

> `need_elevator` : un booleano da impostare con il valore 0 o 1 per includere tra i risultati della ricarca solo gli immobili siti in stabili dotati di ascensore

Come ultima operazione, c'√® da impostare la provincia ed il comune dove si sta cercando l'immobile da acquistare. Per fare questo bisogna aprire il file `provinces_and_municipalities.json` ed includere nell'insieme `SELECTED` uno o pi√π liste e/o campi che rappresentano provincie e comuni tra quelli gi√† presenti nell'insieme `ALL`.

----------

## Eseguire lo Script ##

Per eseguire lo script √® sufficiente lanciare il seguente comando da *shell*

> ```sh
> python CaseDaVedere.py > /dev/null 2>&1
> ```

Se si omette il redirezionamento di `stdout` e `stderr` a `/dev/null`, lo *script* stampa a schermo la pagina della ricerca correntemente esplorata ed il codice dell'immobile correntemente parsato e che ha soddisfatto i requisiti della ricerca. Una volta completato, all'interno della working directory sar√† poi possibile reperire ed aprire il file `casedavedere.html`. Se √® stata poi impostato almeno un'indirizzo email, dovr√† poter essere anche ricevuto un messaggio sulla relativa casella di posta.

> **Nota**.
> Non modificare o cancellare il file autogenerato `property_code.txt`, in quanto mantiene i codici degli immobili che soddisfano i criteri di ricerca impostati, e per i quali √® gi√† stata inoltrata la notifica a mezzo di posta elettronica e che non devono essere notificati una seconda volta.

----------

## Automatizzare lo Script ##

Su sistemi Linux-based √® normalmente disponibile il servizio *cron* che altro non √® che uno *scheduler* di *cron-jobs*. Questi ultimi possono essere un qualsivoglia eseguibile o *script* da lanciare ad intervalli di tempo ben definiti ed in accordo a determinate regole che possono essere specificate con la sintassi *cron*.

Se per esempio si vuole lanciare lo *script* ogni ora tra le 8:00 e le 20:00 nei soli giorni della settimana che vanno da luned√¨ a venerd√¨, √® sufficiente eseguire da terminale `crontab -e` per aprire l'editor ed inserire in fondo la regola che segue

> ```sh
> 0 8-20 * * 1-5  cd /path/to/the/folder/containing/the/script  &&  python CaseDaVedere.py > /dev/null 2>&1

ezequieljuliano,PropertiesFile4Delphi,,https://github.com/ezequieljuliano/PropertiesFile4Delphi,https://api.github.com/repos/PropertiesFile4Delphi/ezequieljuliano,Library for managing configuration files with key-value syntax,"# Properties File For Delphi
The PropertiesFile4Delphi consists of a library for handling **key=value** format configuration files. 

## About The Project
Many times, for various reasons, it is necessary to parameterize the application starting from a configuration mechanism. In Delphi is common to use INI files to store the settings, but working with these files is a bit repetitive and unproductive. The API PropertiesFile4Delphi facilitates this work with configuration files replacing the use of INI files. It is an API to manage simple text files, which are written with the **key=value** syntax, storing a unique key per line.

### Key Features
* Store and load data via simplified interface;
* Map configuration files to simplified classes.

### Built With
* [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/br/products/delphi/starter) - The IDE used 

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
To use this library an updated version of Delphi IDE (XE or higher) is required.

### Installation
Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ezequieljuliano/PropertiesFile4Delphi.git
```

Add the ""Search Path"" of your IDE or your project the following directories:
```
PropertiesFile4Delphi\src
```

## Usage
Create or edit configuration files by declaring a variable of type IPropertiesFile and using the TPropertiesFileStorage implementation:

### Saving a Properties File
```
uses
  
  PropertiesFile,
  PropertiesFile.Storage;

procedure Save;
var
  propertiesFile: IPropertiesFile;
begin
  propertiesFile := TPropertiesFileStorage.Create;
  propertiesFile.PropertyItem['app.title'] := 'Properties File For Delphi';
  propertiesFile.PropertyItem['app.version'] := '1.0.0';
  propertiesFile.SaveToFile('application.properties');
end;

```

### Loading a Properties File
```
uses
  
  PropertiesFile,
  PropertiesFile.Storage;

procedure Load;
var
  propertiesFile: IPropertiesFile;
begin
  propertiesFile := TPropertiesFileStorage.Create;
  propertiesFile.LoadFromFile('application.properties');
  Self.Caption := propertiesFile.PropertyItem['app.title'] + '-' + propertiesFile.PropertyItem['app.version'];
end;

```

### Mapping Support and Configuration Classes
PropertiesFile4Delphi library provides a set of mapping classes. This way you can work directly with classes rather than getting manipulating files in your source code. The first step to using the configuration mechanism in an application is to create a specific class to store the desired parameters and write it down with **[PropertiesFile]** and inherit **TPropertiesFileObject** class.

Mapping example:
```
uses
  
  PropertiesFile.Mapping;

type

  [PropertiesFile('security.properties')]
  TSecurityConfig = class(TPropertiesFileObject)
  private
    [NotNull]
    [PropertyItem('username')]
    fUsername: string;

    [NotNull]
    [PropertyItem('password')]
    fPassword: string;
  public
    property Username: string read fUsername write fUsername;
    property Password: string read fPassword write fPassword;
  end;

```

When the class is destroyed the file is automatically saved:
```
procedure Load;
var
  securityConfig: TSecurityConfig;
begin
  securityConfig := TSecurityConfig.Create;
  try
    securityConfig.Username := 'admin';
    securityConfig.Password := 'admin';
  finally
    securityConfig.Free;
  end;
end;

```

When instantiating the class the data is loaded:
```
procedure Login;
var
  securityConfig: TSecurityConfig;
begin
  securityConfig := TSecurityConfig.Create;
  try
    Login(securityConfig.Username, securityConfig.Password);
  finally
    securityConfig.Free;
  end;
end;

```

Supported field mappings:
* PropertyItem: alias field definition;
* NotNull: mandatory field definition;
* Ignore: Fields that should be ignored;
* ReadOnly: Fields that are read-only (can be applied at class level).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Overview

An analysis and regression modeling of over 21,000 real estate transactions in King County, Washington is completed to improve home valuation and real estate advisory. The findings include top features that are important to the *bestimate* model, which are square footage of living space, distance to Seattle, total distance to both Seattle and Redmond, distance to Redmond, and square footage of living space of the nearest 15 neighbors. The *bestimate* model that is the tuned random forest performs best in predicting house prices based on over 20 features. It explains 88% of the variance in the data and its predictions are USD 107,000 off from the actual prices on average.

![header](data/images/gokhan-kara-rkiL2esY7yM-unsplash.jpg)

## Business and Data Understanding

Real estate agencies in King County, Washington may be able to improve their advisory services by identifying important features that factor in home valuation based on relevant data. Doing so will allow real estate agents to provide more accurate prices to clients as supported by historical records. Using publicly available data, I describe patterns in real estate transactions such as features that likely drive prices.

The [King County data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) spans a year between 2014 and 2015 with over 21,000 real estate transactions and 21 features, of which the dependent variable to predict is `price`. A full description of all column features is provided along with other data files, available in the repository's [data folder](https://github.com/czarinagluna/regression-analysis-for-estimating-prices/tree/main/data).

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

![](data/images/fig2.png)

The highest peaks in the number of houses sold per month happened in the seasons of spring and summer. The decline in the months that followed dropped to the lowest point at the first month of the new year. As for the price of houses sold per month, the values followed roughly the same pattern.

![](data/images/fig3.png)

Price is strongly correlated with `sqft_living`, `grade`, `sqft_living15`, `bathrooms`, and `bathrooms`. 

Let's visualize their relationships and distributions.

![](data/images/fig4.png)

**Geospatial Mapping**

> ""*Location, location, location*""

**Location is important in real estate and in analysis!**

Let's map the data points.

![](data/images/fig5.png)

The concentrated geographic patterns reveal parts of the county populated by the more expensive houses represented by darker colors like the island at the center. The even more expensive houses sold for over a million dollars are located at about the same spots as the dark dots.

Locate the highest priced houses in the data in the following map:

![](data/images/fig6.png)

**Interactive Maps**

I created choropleth maps ([map notebook](https://github.com/czarinagluna/regression-analysis-for-estimating-prices/blob/main/map.ipynb)) to further understand how house prices vary by location.

![](data/images/fig7.png)

To interact with the maps, please use the [notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/czarinagluna/regression-analysis-for-estimating-prices/blob/main/map.ipynb).

## Data Modeling and Results

I iterate over regression models to predict the dependent variable `price` that is continuous: from simple to multiple linear regression, ridge and lasso regression, decision trees to random forests. For hyperparameter tuning, I perform grid search ([code](https://github.com/czarinagluna/regression-analysis-for-estimating-prices/blob/main/gridsearch.ipynb)) to find the optimal parameters of decision trees and random forests.

**Model Performance**

![](data/images/fig8.png)

**Baseline to *Bestimate* Model**

The baseline model `simple_lr` significantly improved to the `poly_tuned_rf`, our *bestimate* model:
* from an R-squared of 0.47 to 0.88, and
* from a Root Mean Squared Error of USD 217,000 to USD  107,000

To visualize the significant difference, let's plot how far away the predictions of the baseline model are to the actual prices versus how much closer the predictions of the bestimate model are:

![](data/images/fig9.png)

For advisory, the top five features with the highest mean feature importances to the model are:
1. Square footage of living space
2. Distance to Seattle
3. Total distance to both Seattle and Redmond
4. Distance to Redmond
5. Square footage of living space of the nearest 15 neighbors

The other important features that follows are overall grade related to the construction and design of the house, quality of view from the house, zipcode, whether the house is on a waterfront, and square footage of lot.

**Model Deployment**

Finally, I deploy the Random Forest regression model ([demo](https://streamlit.io/)) as a prototype I develop for a client-facing application that serves as a Home Value Estimator.

## Catatan Untuk Fitur Super Admin

- Untuk Login Super Admin bisa dilakukan dengan mengakses http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/login (jika dijalankan secara lokal).
- Antarmuka Register Super Admin tidak disertakan pada projek ini, cara alternatif untuk dapat mengakses panel super admin adalah melakukan input data manual ke tabel admins pada database setelah melakukan migrasi.
- Berikut adalah Informasi yang bisa dimasukkan ke tabel admins : (catatan untuk password gunakan format enkripsi, misal 12345678 : $2y$10$tjEkfXLiHAgvgAD.2uDb4uxgQD1xxS4a2y85C4hmeCOgO3NP.fewy , kemudian masukkan value 1 pada kolom isSuper)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Offer1 Interview Exercise

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to give you a quick starting place for the exercise.


## Exercise Description

Image that you have been hired to create a new Real Estate application to help consumers purchase a home. Your new company is up against the a tight timeline and needs to deliver a minimum viable product (mvp) ASAP! In order to compete in the market place your MVP should provide the following core functionality:

- View/browse all available homes 
- Filter homes by City, Price, Number of Bedrooms
- Show detailed view for a selected home

However, if you really want to win over customers the following nice to haves would be greatly received by your customers:

- Sign-in Page
- Ability to share a home on social media
- Send a message to the seller's agent


## Solution Details

Create a detailed web app that solves for the following:

- modularity/re-use of components
- appropriate handling of flow/navigation
- appropirate handling of data/state
- Look and feel of the application (after all this is a GUI)
- quality (unit or functional tests are extra credit)

A sample [data set](./src/homes.json) representing properties has been included to help get you started on what an API call would likely return for the list of active properties. Due to limited timeframe for the assignment it is fine to mock out API calls, however, your application should still dispatch events as though it was making API calls to a service and handle/store data as though it was received from an API call.

As each solution is reviewed there will be an emphasis on the use of ReactJS best practices, design patterns, use of standard packages, use of ES6.


## Submitting the Exercise

1. Ensure that the scripts below (npm start/test/build) are all working for your solution. They should all run successfully.

2. Please make sure the repo is public. If you prefer to keep your repo private, then ensure you have granted read access to [tonyhernandez](https://github.com/tonyhernandez) and [mapayares](https://github.com/mapayares).

3. Completed the Google Form [here](https://forms.gle/We7VGi73apbECGKL6) once you are done with the code. Once submitted do not make any further changes to the code!


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

> **Research Question**  
> Which factors influence listing prices of Berlin real estate?

# Methodology üõ†Ô∏è
- Web scraping data from `immobilienscout24.de`, `immowelt.de`, and `ebay-kleinanzeigen.de`
- Data cleaning
- Modeling
  - Linear Regression
  - Hierarchical linear model with random intercepts
 
 # Results üî¨
*You can download the full report [here](https://github.com/moritzwilksch/BerlinRealEstatePrices/raw/main/documents/report.pdf). It highlights...*
### The relationship between property attributes and price
> üîë Take aways:

- larger properties are more expensive
- temporary living is overpriced (although you pay for flexibility...)
- houses (compared to apartments, everything else held constant) are significantly more expensive to rent, but cheaper to buy
- offers from private sellers and landlords tend to be cheaper than offers from commercial entities

### The importance of location
> üîë Take away: Properties in the city center are more expensive

![asdf](documents/plots/geoplot_rentals_and_sales.png)

### Zip code areas that are ""cheap"" considering their proximity to the city center
> üîë Take away: Some zip code areas offer good value for money if you want to be close to the action

Through this project, any rental property management company can track customers, property assets, maintenance requests, payments, employees and scheduled maintenance. Company can build analytics on this database and automated daily reports will be sent.","# Rental-Database-Project

## Purpose: 
This project aims to create a data model and design a complete database for rental property management system. It aims to cover the whole business model of a rental property management system which deals with different users who are going to use this database.

## Approach: 
I have followed Forward Engineering approach and designed EER model diagram first by defining tables and their attributes, established relationships and database objects like tables schema is populated. 
Here is the below approach to design an EER model ÔÉ†
a)	Building Details table ‚Äì Consists of details of different buildings in the vicinity or on a street. 
b)	Unit Details table ‚Äì consists of details of the unit like unit number, resident id, no of bedrooms, no of washrooms, pet allowed, in unit laundry facility available.
c)	Staff Table ‚Äì Management Staff and Maintenance Staff are responsible for overall management of units in respective buildings. Management staff takes care of lease details, payments, inspection checks and maintenance requests logged, if any. Maintenance Staff is responsible for servicing or repairing items found during maintenance requests logged or during inspection checks.
d)	Appointment schedules ‚Äì Residents can schedule an appointment with management staff for either logging maintenance requests or any other inquiries/concerns they have during the stay.
e)	Inspection checks ‚Äì This table is designed to serve the purpose that all inspection checks are tracked and if any observation is found then they can be used for corrections or warnings to be given to residents.
f)	Maintenance Requests ‚Äì This table helps to keep track of maintenance requests logged and ensure that they are being serviced by the maintenance staff on time.
g)	Lease Details: It keeps a track of lease details agreed between management company and resident Id. It has attributes like lease id, lease term, lease start and end date etc. 
h)	Lease Payment Details:  This helps in keeping track of payment details such as monthly rent, deposit, pet deposit, total payment amount etc. 
i)	Security deposit returns: This helps in keeping track of expired leases and management company is now responsible for repayment of security deposits which they took from the residents during the start of the lease. 
j)	Role Table: This defines different roles of people here. 

### Database Objects: 

1)	Tables ‚Äì This has been described above. 
2)	Views ‚Äì 
viewLeaseDetails : This view helps in seeing all the lease and lease payment details.

viewResidentialDetails : This view helps in viewing Residential Data

3)	Functions ‚Äì calculateTotalAmount(). This function helps in determining total amount received by management staff for the lease.
4)	Stored Procedures ‚Äì usp_AddDatatoSecurityDepositReturns()
5)	Triggers ‚Äì 
negative_value : This trigger helps in validating the data for negative values entered on number of bedrooms in LeaseDetails table. 

negative_value_bathrooms : This trigger helps in validating the data for negative values entered on number of bathrooms in LeaseDetails table. 

6)	Transactions ‚Äì transactionView

### Notice

(10/05/2023) I'm getting a question on setting up the project (sorry for seeing that 1 month later). I'm sorry but the project was
never properly packaged and released. The database in this project was hosted on an Amazon RDS server. I deliberately left out
the configuration of that part for safety reason.  So in order to make the project to work you'll need to launch an RDS instance
and configure properly. You will also want to connect to google cloud storage since that's where the images are stored. Then you can run the backend in a proper IDE such as Intellij locally. I'm pretty occupied right now and probably won't have time to setup
a wiki any time soon. But if you'd like you can leave your email in my form and I'll reach out. Thank you for liking my project.

### Current Features
1. Invoice dashboard with long polling listening to backend for any public/personal invoice update
2. Quick and simple maintenance request sending/handling and public utils reservation/cancellation
3. Discussion board that supports live chat and infinite scrolling!

See video demo here:

### Updates
We now support canceling public utils on the resident side! No more worries that you accidentally clicked something!
![CancelReservation](https://github.com/Jubilee101/SweetHome/blob/main/demoResources/deleteReservation.gif)

### Tools and Frameworks
SweetHome mainly uses Spring Boot to build its backend and React.js for the frontend. It also utilized GCS to store images. 
Spring Data JPA is used for better and easier database manipulation.

### Notice
This is the backend implementation of SweetHome, please see frontend [here](https://github.com/Jubilee101/SweetHomeFE) :)

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Roadmap / Ideas

Below a study about some good practice in term of UX/UI found on large real estate portal or tech brokerage.

### Markers

Markers icons for properties need to be similar in order to be separate other information that can be displayed on the map. Using icon, number or colors can help to distinguishSometimes there are multiple property at the same location needs to be clear, ex. having an indication of the size (label or icon size) and separate single results.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/funda.nl.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/funda.nl.png)

[funda.nl](https://funda.nl) with 3 different icon markers (single, 1-30, multiple)

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/zillow.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/zillow.png)

[zillow.com](https://zillow.com) different colors per type

### Animation

Sometimes map navigation can be sluggish so adding animation while loading elements help users

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/seloger-anim.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/seloger-anim.gif)

[seloger.com](https://seloger.com) marker animation when zoomed

### Clustering

Display all the listings on the map to avoid the feeling that properties are missing. Then do not overload the map and create dynamic clusters that varies with zoom.
Also using a indication of the size of the cluster with a number and different size is better in term of UX.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/homesnap.com.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/homesnap.com.png)

[homesnap.com](https://homesnap.com) with a number and an according circle size

### Street Number, Train Station

In real-estate it can be nice to get the street number, train station, and every helpful infomration when zoomed in.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/street-number.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/street-number.png)

[mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com) configured to display street numbers when zoom 17+

### Parcel view ü§ì

When zoomed display the parcel with the estimated price

[redfin.com](https://redfin.com) parcel view

### POI ü§ì

Display all the point of interest around the properties. More for an advanced usage. Can also be used to generate a Walkscore.

- Transit (train, tram, bus, metro, boat, scooter, bike, wheelchair, ..)
- Schools (elementary, middle, high, private, public, ..)
- Supermarket
- Schools w/ district

[nooklyn.com](https://nooklyn.com) metro lines with colors

### Overlays ü§ì

Display on the map information like satellite, bird view, crime, flood insurance, elevation overlays, mobile or Internet speed, etc.. Can be count-productive in some location.

[immobilienscout24.de](https://immobilienscout24.de) internet speed on the map

### Highlight Map & List

In Mix mode (Map + List/Photo), clicking on a property in the map should highlight the property in the list, and same in the other way. The list should also scroll to be visible.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/apartment.com.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/apartment.com.png)

[apartment.com](https://apartment.com) when click on map it scroll and highlight in the list, same in the other way

### Listing already seen

Be able to identify properties already clicked, visited or in favorite help a lot.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/openlistings.com.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/openlistings.com.png)

[openlistings.com](https://openlistings.com) put marker label in gray once clicked

### Open houses

Display the coming open houses directly on the map to convert more.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/compass-openhouse.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/compass-openhouse.png)

[compass.com](https://compass.com) open houses on the map

### Properties with an approximate location

When dealing with properties we cannot geolocate like non-exclusive properties, a nice radius or polygon can help

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/bienici.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/bienici.png)

[bienici.com](https://bienici.com) with non-exclusive properties

### New properties

Display new property but also price reduced can be helpful. 

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/xome.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/xome.png)

[xome.com](https://xome.com) displays NEW listings

### Tags

Display tags, just be careful not do a rainbow of icons, for example nobody knows what stars are meaning.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/redfin.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/redfin.png)

[redfin.com](https://redfin.com/) add tags like HOT, STAR, VIDEO, EXCLUSIVE

### List mode ü§ì

Instead of large picture in mix mode, having a list mode like a spreadsheet. Sometimes also possible to export into a spreadsheet.

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/redfin-list.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/redfin-list.png)

[redfin.com](https://redfin.com) list mode

### Dark mode ü§ì

All new browser are now compatible with a dark mode, map can do that too

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/darkmode.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/darkmode.png)

[mapbox.com](https://mapbox.com) custom map for dark mode

### Handle Go Back

When click on the Go Back button, it should go back to the previous map search.

### Property detail

See the property detail should open a new window (ala Airbnb). Replacing the existing page make navigation difficult because going back will take too long. It's also possible to open in the property detail page in same page in a large popup like Zillow but it can render the page very heavy.

### WebGL

Thanks to WebGL [adoption](https://caniuse.com/#feat=webgl) maps can now have a 3D effect like on Waze App. Furthermore loading is far smoother than with previous Leaflet tiles. 

![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/home61.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquilboss/searchmap.js/master/doc/home61.png)

[home61.com](https://www.home61.com) map with 30¬∞ pinch

### Performance

Page speed is important. Try to use the minimum of javascript overhead (ideally just vanilla JS). Reduce the number of HTTP call and their size. Dedicate data storage, 100% in memory, that support Spatial queries like Polygon and Point (PostGIS). MongoDB, MySQL>5.6, MariaDB and Postgres are all good solutions. Best performances are done with PostGre+PostRest then probably MongoDB. Heavily use client cache and service workers if needed. Parallelize the search queries on different datacenter and use the fastest (ala Algolia). 

### Loading animation

Should not block the navigation like click'n drag. To avoid loading when moving we can also have not checked by default ""Redo search in the area option""

### Other examples

- Ratio Map/Photo
- Photo Size, Format and compression
- Photo Carousel (or Video)
- Map Property Popup (ala Zillow)
- Map boundaries, zoom limits and speed

## About the rei-search app

Real estate investment decisions should always begin with due diligence in order to stack the deck in your favor. Even before you decide on the type of real estate you wish to invest in, you should know the details about where you will invest.

### Metropolitan Statistical Areas
This app focuses on discovering details about metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), which are geographic regions centered around areas of high population density (i.e., big cities) and integrated economies. Statistics about the population and economy of MSAs in the geography you wish to invest are important to consider if you want to be successful as an investor.

There are 392 (as of 2020) MSAs in the United states, and you can explore key statistical information about each of them with this app.

Job candidate homework on real estate web scraping topic.

Modelling/representing real estate data in backend, scraping, cleaning and serving them through the REST API.

## Homework requirements

*DISCLAIMER: Some decisions in these project don't reflect my point of view on design, but still comply with homework requirements:*

- scraper scrapes given website(s) (which may have dynamic content with JS)
- models/schemas should be designed in a way they can cover different heterogeneous systems
- scraper runs should be repeatable, scraper may be launched more than once per day (in that case data should be overwritten)
- data should be stored in database/storage with granularity of one day
- scraped data should be available through REST API
- API server shouldn't be read-only, but CRUD, so data may come to database through API as well

# Designing & modelling

## Architecture

For scraping `scrapy` framework was chosen as it has all batteries included.

Schemas/models representing real estates/apartments are implemented using `pydantic`, so they have parsing&validation
out-of-the-box.

For API the choice was done for `FastAPI` which has first-class support for pydantic and also has a lot of batteries included, like openapi docs viewer.

""Snapshot"" requirement is implemented using `S3`-like object storage (`MinIO`), so each day there are separate jsons
which may be rewritten on repeated scraper execution. Object storage doesn't care about redundancy in this manner, so
each day JSON may have duplicates.

As for database, NoSQL is my personal preference for such situations, `MongoDB` is quite nice for JSON data,
is easily scalable, has good suport for geospatial queries etc. Scraper does care (TODO) about duplicates when saving to db is done.

Project is kind of monorepo. Talking about using it in production, I'd make a lib from `shared/` to be installable using pip.
API could be run as a container, similarly to Mongo and Minio. Scraper can/should be launched manually or using some kind of planner,
maybe cron, maybe K8S cronjob, maybe something like Apache airflow.

# Development / Installation / Usage

## Installation

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pip-tools pre-commit
pip-sync requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

## Running

Check and update `.env` to your liking.

Run MinIO and MongoDB in background: `docker-compose up -d`

Run API (todo docker): `uvicorn --reload --reload-dir api api:app`

API is available at http://localhost:8000 and OpenAPI docs are available at http://localhost:8000/docs

Run scraper: `scrapy run`

Results can be checked in Mongo UI at http://localhost:8081 and in MinIO at http://localhost:9001 (credentials are located in `.env`)

![](./docs/mongo_ui.png)
![](./docs/minio.png)

## Linting

Format using `black .` and `isort .`

```shell
pre-commit run -a
# or manually
ruff .
mypy .
```

## Testing

```shell
pytest
```

## Locking dependencies

```shell
pip-compile --no-emit-index-url --output-file=requirements.txt --resolver=backtracking pyproject.toml
pip-compile --all-extras --no-emit-index-url --output-file=requirements-dev.txt --resolver=backtracking pyproject.toml
```

For repinning `rm requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt && pip-compile ...`

## TODO

- dockerize api
- PUT route in api/ for update/replacement
- better docs (probably split stuff into multiple markdown files, put them to docs/ and point there from README)
- duplicates checker in scraper pipeline
- ensure photos are saved only once, when apartment is saved to mongo
- save logs to minio (yes, it's on diagram, but not yet implemented)
- more unit tests, integration tests
  * maybe try scrapy-autounit, scrapy-html-storage or similar plugins.
  * casettes unfortunately don't work for twisted, maybe try some sockets/dns mocking
- bonuses
  * snippets: loading data from mongo and casting jsons into Apartment pydantic model
  * maybe jupyter notebook with geo map etc

 Evaluate the overall performance of the real estate market based on property sales data.

## Key Questions

1. What are the main factors contributing to variations in property prices for houses in the dataset?

2. Does the number of bedrooms have a noticeable impact on property prices, and if so, what is the relationship?

3. How has the average property price changed over time? Are there any seasonal patterns or long-term trends?

4.  Is there any correlation between property prices and property type?

5. Are there significant differences in property prices between different postcodes?

6. Deduce the top six postcodes by year's price.

7.  Are there  specific neighborhoods or postcodes that have shown consistent growth in property prices?

8.  Which date corresponds to the highest number of sales?

9.  Which year witnessed the lowest number of sales?

10. Find out the postcode with the highest average price per sale.

11. Are there any patterns or trends in the dates of property sales?

12.  What is the overall health of the real estate market based on the sales data?

13.   Can we identify any potential investment opportunities or areas where property prices have the potential to increase significantly?

## Assumptions
  - Currency remained stable over time. Currency fluctuations impact price changes.
  - Market homogeneity; implying  the market is relatively homogenous within the defined geographical areas ( postcodes).
  - Market conditions were stable over the analysis period. Market fluctuations can happen due to economic or political factors.
  - All relevant factors influencing property prices are included in the dataset i.e. external factors can influence price e.g. market sentiment but for this case study, only the variables listed in the dataset affect price.
  - Changes in Property prices are reflected in the data promptly.

# Deployment Instructions From Brad Traversy.

# Django Deployment to Ubuntu 18.04

In this guide I will go through all the steps to create a VPS, secure it and deploy a Django application. This is a summarized document from this [digital ocean doc](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04)

Any commands with ""$"" at the beginning run on your local machine and any ""#"" run when logged into the server

## Create A Digital Ocean Droplet

Use [this link](https://m.do.co/c/5424d440c63a) and get $10 free. Just select the $5 plan unless this a production app.

# Security & Access

### Creating SSH keys (Optional)

You can choose to create SSH keys to login if you want. If not, you will get the password sent to your email to login via SSH

To generate a key on your local machine

```
$ ssh-keygen
```

Hit enter all the way through and it will create a public and private key at

```
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

You want to copy the public key (.pub file)

```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the entire output and add as an SSH key for Digital Ocean

### Login To Your Server

If you setup SSH keys correctly the command below will let you right in. If you did not use SSH keys, it will ask for a password. This is the one that was mailed to you

```
$ ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### Create a new user

It will ask for a password, use something secure. You can just hit enter through all the fields. I used the user ""djangoadmin"" but you can use anything

```
# adduser djangoadmin
```

### Give root privileges

```
# usermod -aG sudo djangoadmin
```

### SSH keys for the new user

Now we need to setup SSH keys for the new user. You will need to get them from your local machine

### Exit the server

You need to copy the key from your local machine so either exit or open a new terminal

```
# exit
```

You can generate a different key if you want but we will use the same one so lets output it, select it and copy it

```
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### Log back into the server

```
$ ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### Add SSH key for new user

Navigate to the new users home folder and create a file at '.ssh/authorized_keys' and paste in the key

```
# cd /home/djangoadmin
# mkdir .ssh
# cd .ssh
# nano authorized_keys
Paste the key and hit ""ctrl-x"", hit ""y"" to save and ""enter"" to exit
```

### Login as new user

You should now get let in as the new user

```
$ ssh djangoadmin@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### Disable root login

```
# sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

### Change the following

```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
```

### Reload sshd service

```
# sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

# Simple Firewall Setup

See which apps are registered with the firewall

```
# sudo ufw app list
```

Allow OpenSSH

```
### sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
```

### Enable firewall

```
# sudo ufw enable
```

### To check status

```
# sudo ufw status
```

We are now done with access and security and will move on to installing software

# Software

## Update packages

```
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt upgrade
```

## Install Python 3, Postgres & NGINX

```
# sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev libpq-dev postgresql postgresql-contrib nginx curl
```

# Postgres Database & User Setup

```
# sudo -u postgres psql
```

You should now be logged into the pg shell

### Create a database

```
CREATE DATABASE btre_prod;
```

### Create user

```
CREATE USER dbadmin WITH PASSWORD 'abc123!';
```

### Set default encoding, tansaction isolation scheme (Recommended from Django)

```
ALTER ROLE dbadmin SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE dbadmin SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE dbadmin SET timezone TO 'UTC';
```

### Give User access to database

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE btre_prod TO dbadmin;
```

### Quit out of Postgres

```
\q
```

# Vitrual Environment

You need to install the python3-venv package

```
# sudo apt install python3-venv
```

### Create project directory

```
# mkdir pyapps
# cd pyapps
```

### Create venv

```
# python3 -m venv ./venv
```

### Activate the environment

```
# source venv/bin/activate
```

# Git & Upload

### Pip dependencies

From your local machine, create a requirements.txt with your app dependencies. Make sure you push this to your repo

```
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Create a new repo and push to it (you guys know how to do that)

### Clone the project into the app folder on your server (Either HTTPS or setup SSH keys)

```
# git clone https://github.com/yourgithubname/btre_project.git
```

## Install pip modules from requirements

You could manually install each one as well

```
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Local Settings Setup

Add code to your settings.py file and push to server

```
try:
    from .local_settings import *
except ImportError:
    pass
```

Create a file called **local_settings.py** on your server along side of settings.py and add the following

- SECRET_KEY
- ALLOWED_HOSTS
- DATABASES
- DEBUG
- EMAIL\_\*

## Run Migrations
```
# python manage.py makemigrations
# python manage.py migrate
```

## Create super user

```
# python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Create static files
```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### Create exception for port 8000

```
# sudo ufw allow 8000
```

## Run Server

```
# python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Test the site at YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000

Add some data in the admin area

# Gunicorn Setup

Install gunicorn

```
# pip install gunicorn
```

Add to requirements.txt

```
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

### Test Gunicorn serve

```
# gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 btre.wsgi
```

Your images, etc will be gone

### Stop server & deactivate virtual env

```
ctrl-c
# deactivate
```

### Open gunicorn.socket file

```
# sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.socket
```

### Copy this code, paste it in and save

```
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock

[Install]
WantedBy=sockets.target
```

### Open gunicorn.service file

```
# sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
```

### Copy this code, paste it in and save

```
[Unit]
Description=gunicorn daemon
Requires=gunicorn.socket
After=network.target

[Service]
User=djangoadmin
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/djangoadmin/pyapps/btre_project
ExecStart=/home/djangoadmin/pyapps/venv/bin/gunicorn \
          --access-logfile - \
          --workers 3 \
          --bind unix:/run/gunicorn.sock \
          btre.wsgi:application

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Start and enable Gunicorn socket

```
# sudo systemctl start gunicorn.socket
# sudo systemctl enable gunicorn.socket
```

### Check status of guinicorn

```
# sudo systemctl status gunicorn.socket
```

### Check the existence of gunicorn.sock

```
# file /run/gunicorn.sock
```

# NGINX Setup

### Create project folder

```
# sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/btre_project
```

### Copy this code and paste into the file

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name YOUR_IP_ADDRESS;

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /home/djangoadmin/pyapps/btre_project;
    }
    
    location /media/ {
        root /home/djangoadmin/pyapps/btre_project;    
    }

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/run/gunicorn.sock;
    }
}
```

### Enable the file by linking to the sites-enabled dir

```
# sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/btre_project /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

### Test NGINX config

```
# sudo nginx -t
```

### Restart NGINX

```
# sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Remove port 8000 from firewall and open up our firewall to allow normal traffic on port 80

```
# sudo ufw delete allow 8000
# sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

### You will probably need to up the max upload size to be able to create listings with images

Open up the nginx conf file

```
# sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

### Add this to the http{} area

```
client_max_body_size 20M;
```

### Reload NGINX

```
# sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Media File Issue
You may have some issues with images not showing up. I would suggest, deleting all data and starting fresh as well as removeing the ""photos"" folder in the ""media folder""
```
# sudo rm -rf media/photos
```

# Domain Setup

Go to your domain registrar and create the following a record

```
@  A Record  YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
www  CNAME  example.com
```

### Go to local_settings.py on the server and change ""ALLOWED_HOSTS"" to include the domain

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['IP_ADDRESS', 'example.com', 'www.example.com']
```

### Edit /etc/nginx/sites-available/btre_project

```
server {
    listen: 80;
    server_name xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx example.com www.example.com;
}
```

### Reload NGINX & Gunicorn

```
# sudo systemctl restart nginx
# sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
```

Independent value benchmaker of the residential real estate market

## Summary

It is very hard to establish the current value of a residential real estate property. Based on several indicators that are scattered on the internet, we can once and for all establish a clear cut method to provide everyone with a benchmark for the value of any residential property.

## Background

It is currently almost impossible to predict whether the asking price for a real estate property is overvalued, undervalued or on par with value. The only reference for most people is the historical price. That is not good enough indicator since asking price, selling price and value are three different things. By combining several publicly found data, we can generate a objective value range, which can help buyers and sellers to set the right price to sell or buy for by offering a benchmark.

Almost every human in its lifetime is speculating whether to buy a property for its family. Some do it more often as a small time investors and others are selling their owned property to make means for their other life expenditures. The ever present question is around all of them. What should I sell/but it for? As of now, if you are not having big enough real estate company, or if you do not work in a consulting company such as Deloitte, KPMG and others, you do not know really how to answer that questions and you could easily be tricked in underpricing your property while selling and overpaying for a property while buying. 

My motivation for this project lies in my fascination by residential real estate property and my never ending problem of establishing whether my investment is in the right amount, or if I am overpaying for it. I have to say I have been on both ends, but I can judge only based on my feeling never based on merit. I think that I overpayed for a property as well as underpayed for another one. I do not want to think anymore, I want to know.

This topic is important, because it brings stability to the market and useful tool to the hands of small investors and first time property buyers and sellers. It removes the knowledge only from the big corporations and gives it to hands of everyone and therefore it democratizes the market.

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The solution will enable a small time investor that purchase or sells about one property per year with educated information scan the market and provide a qualified offer.

The Residential real estate market monitor can be used while finding a suitable property to buy as an investment, or for your own use. The user is most likely a person in the age between 30 - 50 years old that belongs to the middle class and is looking to invest their money to the real estate market. 

The user has the following needs:
* Understand the value of the property
* Understanding what price to offer/pay for the property
* Select the right property to buy based on value indicators and use these indicators as bargaining power while negotiating the price

## Data sources and AI methods

We will collect various information that normally you have to look for in various sources and through scraping this data, putting a weight to the information and through the method of linear regression and nearest neighbor method that will allow us to get the suggested value and then through logistic regression, we will establish the probability of that number to be exact and form a range for a benchmark.

| Source of Data      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Property Taxes| $ amount|
| Market Value| $ amount|
| Replacement Cost| $ amount|
| HOA fees   | $ amount|
| HOA  | Monies in the bank according to the latest tax statement |
| Historical sales data of comparable properties   | $ amount|
| Property Orientation   | N, NW, W, SW, S, SE, E, NE |
| Property size   | standartized dispositions |
| Property size   | m2 |
| Property ownership type   | Owner or common ownership |
| Property size   | standartized dispositions |
| Property   | Age |
| Property   | Latest reconstruction |
| City   | Population |
| Safety  | Neighborhood crime statistics |
| Education  | Number of grade schools |
| Education  | Number of secondary schools |
| Education  | Grade school ranking |
| Education  | Secondary school ranking |
| Public transportation  | Nearest bus stop |
| Public transportation  | Nearest tram stop |
| Public transportation  | Nearest metro stop |
| Public transportation  | Airport |
| Economy  | Inflation |
| Economy  | Economy growth |
| Economy  | City economy growth |
| Economy  | State economy growth |


## Challenges

The project only provides the information now reserved for elites to everyone and therefore provides a level playing field; however, it cannot provide more than that. It can inform the user and allow it to make an educational offer; however, it does not provide and cannot react on a market in real time. It only offers a range where the property should be priced based on its value based on last years data collected by national and state agencies; however, if the market moved within a year the range of the price is moving with it. 

Therefore the biggest challenge is to incorporate in the monitor an option that will give the best possible range of price based on last years data and current level of inflation and supply combined with demand. It will never provide a specific price that will be absolutely accurate. The best it can do is to be a benchmark.

## What next?

I need people with the following skills to get this project of the ground:
* AI python programmer
* Data analyst and data builder
* UX/UI Designer

The only way this project can take of the ground is to find a cofounder that has technical skills and can build the product. My skill is more in marketing and business development, but sadly I cannot technically build this project.

* Live Version
   <https://skyspringhomes.martinsndifon.tech>
## Goal
The major goal of this project was to further solidify my knowledge of using the technologies listing below in building an application. The application gives the owner of the small real estate company the flexibility of dynamically updatating the websites by creating, modifying or deleting properties/listings as they desire.

## Future update
The mvp of the project was completing the major functionality of allowing for secure CRUD operations by admin to dynamically update the website. Listing below are other features that will be added either to this version of the build or a totally new version using this version as the base for that build.
- Users can signup in two categories; an agent and a client(regular user)
- Signed in clients will have more functionalities which include but not limited to;
	* Favoriting a property for easy reference on revisit
	* A messaging section where clients can leave a message for an agent
- Signed in agents will also have more functionalities
	* A messaging section to interact with client messages
	* A section to manage their uploaded properties(Create, modify or delete)
- Location will be improved to contain different states and cities
- Listings will have a better setup, which will include amenities and other distinguishing factors
- A robust search feature will be added so users can better filter out properties based on different options

## Technologies used
- Backend in python
- RestfulApi
- MySQL
- sqlalchemy
- flask
- JQuery

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a model in R Shiny that allocates an 
insured‚Äôs prospective year property insurance costs in an equitable, easily 
understood manner that saves the client time, provides the option to use an 
‚Äúactuarial‚Äù methodology, while still allowing for maximum flexibility and edits.


## Demo

To demo the app, you have a couple of options:

+ If you want to run the application locally, simply install the package and run the code below:


```r
library(propalloc)
propalloc::run_app()
```

*Note that the run_app function will automatically install package dependencies for you.*

## Scope of Services

Upon completion, this model will be used as a demo to sell future work, similar
to the R Shiny casualty cost allocation model. Once sold, this model will provide
a template for billable projects.

Specifically, the property allocation model will allocate the premium, taxes,
fees, surcharges and any related costs (collectively, the ‚Äúproperty insurance costs‚Äù)
to the desired level. This level can include up to six hierarchies (e.g. Country,
Business Unit, Division, Region, Location, and Intra-location Department). 

The tool will enable the client to incorporate the following criteria into its
allocation process:

- Total Insured Value (TIV)
- Market AOP Rates (provided by Marsh or Client)
- Market CAT Rates
+ Wind Tier
+ Earthquake Exposure
+ Flood Exposure
- Terrorism Rates
- Claim Frequency
- Claim Severity
- Risk Engineering Credits/Surcharges
- Other Manual Adjustments
- Relativity Adjustments
+ Combustible vs. Non-Combustible
+ Sprinkler Type/Status
+ Business Unit (BU)

In addition, the model will allow a client to select various thresholds and 
caps on premium/rate changes.

The tool will also provide multiple summaries, facilitating the comparison of 
the resulting allocation in up to three different scenarios. For example, 
the client can compare the resulting to allocation based upon: proposed market 
rates without adjustment, rates used in the prior year allocation, proposed
increases for budget guidance applied to the rates used in the prior year.

The tool will also give the user the ability to:

- Edit the TIV, properties, or other aspects of the exposures in the 
statement of values (SOV) between the scenarios outlined above
(this is of importance as information often changes throughout the allocation process)
- Force the final allocation for a specific or a set of specific locations to be a fixed number
- Change the different loss severity buckets considered in the model
- Add extra fees after the allocation is complete, while still maintaining the 
allocation of the other property insurance costs

Lastly, the tool will provide a summary by any combination of the six hierarchies
that will calculate the dollar change in premium attributable to any of the following:

- change in TIV,
- change in the initial implied rates,
- claims charges,
- manual ‚Äúall other risk‚Äù adjustment, and/or
- cap placed on the increase in rate and the resulting off-balance associated with a cap.

+ Exporting model results as LaTex tables

## Highlights
+ Easy implementation of aditional sentiment models using inheritance from a base class
+ Easy to change retrain SVM models with different parameters or training data
+ Caching to speed up common tasks (e.g. article loading, model training, etc.)
+ Well documented code (docstrings for classes and functions, annotated notebooks, comments where needed)


## Built with
+ Python 3
+ Jupyter Notebooks

# Getting started
## Downloading data
The first thing to do before using this tool is to provide some data. For the original research, the following data was used:
+ News articles from The Guardian and The Financial Times
+ Sentiment annotated text from several financial news sources (Training data for machine learning model)
+ Consumer confidence data
+ Loughran-McDonald financial sentiment lexicon (For the lexicon-based sentiment model)
+ Real estate data
    + Direct real estate market (UK National Statistics)
    + Securitized real estate market (FTSE EPRA NAREIT UK)

The paper associated with this project provides more detail on the used dataset.
To get started, it is highly advisable to run and test this project with the same data, which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UysbkU5v8Nh1Uhc8bYBeIgDJaZFHoRFe/view?usp=sharing).
The entire zipfile should be extracted in the `data` folder

## Running and evaluating models
The most straightforward way to run and evaluate models is through executing the `Evaluation` Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks` folder. 

Alternatively, the code belows shows how a Python file can evaluate models.

```python
    import articles as art
    from evaluation import Evaluator
    import models.lexicon_based

    # Load Financial Times & The Guardian articles
    articles = art.load_articles()

    # Initialize the sentiment model
    model = models.lexicon_based.Model(articles)

    # Evaluate the model on a given real estate index
    real_estate_index = 'data/real_estate_data/direct/england.csv'
    ev = Evaluator(model, articles, real_estate_index)
```
This code will run the lexicon-based sentiment model on the direct real estate market and output its results and performance metrics, such as the regression coefficients with confidence intervals, plots of its forecast results and its MAPE.

For more detailed information and an example of running the slightly more complex machine learning model, see the `Evaluation` notebook.

## Creating new models
It is easy to implement and analyze new sentiment models by inhereting from the base model class and implementing the `article_sentiment` method. The code below implements a simple new sentiment model.

```python
from models.model_base import ModelBase

class Model(ModelBase):
    """"""
    Ultra-simple lexicon-based sentiment model
    """"""
    def article_sentiment(self, article):
        """"""Returns the positive and negative sentiment scores of a list of tokens as a tuple""""""

        # Use the functions available through Article class
        tokens = article.body_tokenized()

        positivity, negativity, neutrality = 0,0,0
        if 'happy' in tokens:
            positivity = 1
        elif 'sad' in tokens:
            negativity = 1
        else:
            neutrality = 1

        return positivity, negativity, neutrality
```

If desired, `__init__` can be overwritten to add more parameters to a model, however, each `__init__` must set the `self.articles` attribute.

All models inheriting from the `ModelBase` class are automatically compatible with the evaluation scripts.

## Other common tasks
The Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` guide you through the following other tasks:
+ Complex evaluation & exporting results as LaTex tables
+ Training SVM models
+ Determing the classification confidence of SVM models
+ Working with sentiment data from an external model (in the example: Consumer Confidence)
+ Establishing a simple baseline autoregressive model on real estate indices

![real_estate](https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/spotlight-photos/181017-guelphtodayoct18-01.jpg;w=960)

The aim of this project is to perform a data exploration for the real estate French market and to have a good understanding of available variables and the market with a real world 5-years (from 2015 to 2019)
historical sales transactions for the top 9 french cities (Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Nice, Montpellier, Nantes).
The dataset contains details for each transaction (sale date, localization, type of residence, type of sale, land area, living area,
number of rooms, price, etc.).

The project was done using Tableau PrepBuilder for data preparation and cleaning and Tableau Desktop for data visualisation and storytelling with user friendly commands.

The final storytelling on Tableau Desktop is divided into the following steps:
- description of the context
- cities overview
- type of sales analysis
- living and land area analysis
- market understanding
- market evolution over time
- summary table per city
- investments recommendations

<!-- Folder Structure -->
### :bangbang: Folder Structure

<b>Yariga</b> code folder structure seperated to client-side and server-side.
```bash
Yariga-Realestate-Dashboard/
|- client
  |-- src/
    |-- assets/
    |-- components/
      |-- agent/
      |-- charts/
      |-- common/
      |-- home/
      |-- layout/
    |-- constants/
    |-- contexts/
    |-- interfaces/
    |-- pages/
    |-- utils/
    |-- App.tsx
  |-- .env
|- server
  |-- controllers/
  |-- mongodb/
  |-- routes/
  |-- index.js
  |-- .env
```

Now, lets dive into both server and client sides folders.

### CLIENT-SIDE

#### components

`agent/` - `charts/` - `common/` - `home/` - `layout/`

This folder contains all the function components arranged in subfolders, which they're independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the UI (User Interface) of Yariga to avoid unnecessary repetition of the code. those components are beautiful customized widgets using MUI to describe initial theme for widgets as they're named.

#### constants

`index.ts`

This is a JavaScript code that defines an array of objects named propertyReferralsInfo. Each object represents a source of referral for a property (like a real estate property). The array contains five objects representing five different referral sources: Social Media, Marketplace, Websites, Digital Ads, and Others. Each object specifies the percentage of referrals that come from the respective source and a unique color that represents the referral source.

#### interfaces

`agent.d.ts` - `common.d.ts` - `google.d.ts` - `home.d.ts` - `property.d.ts` - `theme.d.ts`

In the context of Refine, the `interfaces` directory is used to store TypeScript interfaces that define the types of data used in the application. This is useful for providing type information to the TypeScript compiler, which can then perform type-checking and provide better autocompletion and error messages.

The `interfaces` directory typically contains one or more `.ts` files, each of which exports one or more interfaces that describe the shape of the data used in the application. For example, if an application uses data from an external API, it might define an interface that describes the structure of the API response.

By storing interfaces in a separate directory, the codebase becomes more organized and easier to maintain. It also encourages good coding practices by making it easier to define and enforce types throughout the application.

#### pages

`agent-profile.tsx` - `agent.tsx` - `all-properties.tsx` - `create-property.tsx` - `edit-property.tsx` - `home.tsx` - `login.tsx` - `my-profile.tsx` - `property-details.tsx` - `index.ts`

In Refine, the pages directory is used to store the React components that correspond to the different pages of the application. These components typically use Refine's built-in components and hooks to provide a complete user interface for interacting with the data in the application.

#### utils

`parse-jwt.ts`

```ts
export function parseJwt(token: string): UserPayload {
  const base64Url = token.split(""."")[1];
  const base64 = base64Url.replace(/-/g, ""+"").replace(/_/g, ""/"");
  const jsonPayload = decodeURIComponent(
    window
      .atob(base64)
      .split("""")
      .map(function (c) {
        return ""%"" + (""00"" + c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16)).slice(-2);
      })
      .join("""")
  );

  return JSON.parse(jsonPayload);
}
```

This code defines a function named `parseJwt` that takes in a JWT (JSON Web Token) string and returns the decoded payload as an object of type `UserPayload`, which is imported from an external file called `google.ts` in the `interfaces` directory.

Inside the `parseJwt` function, the JWT is split into its three components: header, payload, and signature. The payload is extracted and decoded from base64 to JSON format. The resulting JSON string is then parsed into a JavaScript object with the properties defined in `UserPayload` type.

In summary, this function is used to decode a JWT and extract the payload information as an object that can be used in a web application.

`validateForm.ts`

This code exports two utility functions:

1. `validateForm` function takes in an object of form values and validates them to check if any of the required fields are missing. It iterates through each field in the `formValues` object and checks if it is empty. If any required field is empty, it sets `hasError` flag to true and returns an error message in the `errors` object. If all fields are filled, it sets the `hasError` flag to false and returns the empty `errors` object.
2. `hasChanged` function takes in two objects `initialValues` and `currentValues`, representing the initial values of the form fields and the current values of the form fields respectively. It iterates through each field in the `initialValues` object and checks if the corresponding field in the `currentValues` object has been changed. If any field has been changed, it returns `true`. If all fields are unchanged, it returns `false`.

Both of these utility functions can be used to simplify the process of validating and handling form submissions in a React application.

#### contexts

```js
index.ts
```

This is a React code that defines a context provider component named `ColorModeContextProvider` to handle the color mode of a theme used in a React application. The purpose of this component is to provide the theme color mode (either light or dark) and allow the user to switch between them.

The component uses the `createContext` function from React to create a context object named `ColorModeContext`, which will be used to share the state between the components in the React component tree.

The `ColorModeContextProvider` component receives a `PropsWithChildren` type as a prop, which allows the component to receive and render children components.

The component uses `useState` hook to manage the state of the color mode. The `localStorage` is used to store the color mode value to persist the user's preference when the application is closed or reloaded.

The useEffect hook is used to update the localStorage with the new color mode value whenever the mode state value changes.

The component also checks for the user's system color preference using `window?.matchMedia(""(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"").matches` and sets the `systemPreference` value accordingly.

The `setColorMode` function is used to switch the color mode between ""light"" and ""dark"" based on the current mode state value.

Finally, the `ColorModeContext.Provider` component wraps the `ThemeProvider` component from `@pankod/refine-mui` and provides the mode and `setColorMode` values as context values to its children. The `ThemeProvider` component provides a custom theme based on the current color mode value.

```js
theme.ts
```

This code defines two custom theme objects named `overridedLightTheme` and `overridedDarkTheme`. These custom themes are based on the default themes provided by the `@pankod/refine-mui` package, which is a library for customizing Material UI components in React applications.

The `overridedLightTheme` object is a modified version of the `LightTheme` provided by `@pankod/refine-mui`. It overrides some of the default values of the `palette` object in the theme to customize the color scheme of the theme. For example, it changes the primary color to a light gray color with a dark blue hue for its dark shade, and the secondary color to a light gray color with white text.

The `overridedDarkTheme` object is a modified version of the `DarkTheme` provided by `@pankod/refine-mui`. It overrides some of the default values of the `palette` object to customize the color scheme of the theme for the dark mode. For example, it changes the primary color to a dark blue color, the secondary color to a dark gray color with white text, and the background color to a dark shade of gray.

Both `overridedLightTheme` and `overridedDarkTheme` objects are exported for use in other parts of the application. These custom themes can be passed as props to the `ThemeProvider` component from `@pankod/refine-mui` to customize the color scheme of the Material UI components used in the React application.

### SERVER-SIDE

#### controllers

`property.controller.js` - `user.controller.js`

In a Refine app, the `controllers` folder is used to define the functions that handle incoming HTTP requests and generate HTTP responses. Each file in the `controllers` folder typically represents a logical entity or resource in the application, and defines functions that handle different HTTP methods (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for that entity.

The purpose of the `controllers` is to encapsulate the business logic and data manipulation for the different HTTP requests that the application handles. The controller functions typically take the request object as input, extract any necessary data from the request (e.g. query parameters, request body), and perform the necessary operations on the data (e.g. reading from or writing to the database). The functions then generate an appropriate HTTP response (e.g. a JSON object, an HTTP status code) and send it back to the client.

#### mongodb

`models/` - `connect.js`

In a Refine app, the `mongodb` folder is used to define and manage the connection to a MongoDB database. This folder contains a `connect.js` file that exports a function for establishing a connection to a MongoDB database using the Mongoose library.

the `models` folder in the MongoDB directory is used to define Mongoose models for MongoDB collections. A Mongoose model is a wrapper around a MongoDB collection that provides a way to interact with the data in that collection in a more structured and convenient way.

#### routes

`property.route.js` - `user.route.js`

In a Refine app, the `routes` folder is used to define the API endpoints or routes that the server will respond to. Each file in the routes folder typically represents a resource or a set of related endpoints for a particular domain of the application.

The routes are defined using the Express.js routing API, which maps HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to specific URL paths and controller functions that handle the request and response. In addition to defining the routes themselves, the files in the `routes` folder might also define any middleware or validation logic that needs to be applied to the requests.

Overall, the `routes` folder in a Refine app plays an important role in defining the API endpoints that the app exposes to clients, and organizing the code for handling those endpoints in a logical and maintainable way.

#### index.js

This is a Node.js server application using the Express framework that provides APIs for managing users and properties. It uses MongoDB as the database and the `connectDB` function connects to the database using the URL specified in the `.env` file. The server listens on port 8080 and responds with a message ""Hello from Yagira!"" when the root URL is accessed. The `cors` middleware is used to allow cross-origin resource sharing, and `express.json` middleware is used to parse JSON requests. The `userRouter` and `propertyRouter` handle requests for user and property management respectively. Overall, this code sets up a server that provides APIs for managing users and properties with MongoDB as the database.

<!-- Getting Started -->
## 	:toolbox: Getting Started

<!-- Installation -->
### :gear: Installation & Run Locally

#### Step 0:

Note :bangbang: the application uses a MongoDB database, therefore, you need to create a database and connect it to the application, for this, change the `MONGODB_URL` environment variable in `.env` file located in `server` folder.

Note :bangbang: the application uses a Cloudinary Cloud, therefore, you need to create Cloudinary account [here](https://cloudinary.com/) and change the `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`,`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_API_KEY` & `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` environment variables in `.env` file located in `server` folder.

Note :bangbang: the application uses a `Google Auth`, to add `Google sign-in` into Yariga site and save time your customers, Google sign-in allows login through Google in one click. therefore, before you can integrate `Google sign-in`, you need to create a `Google Client ID` and `Google Client Secret`. explore how-to tutorial [here](https://www.askdata.com/docs/dataset-google-analytics-how-to-get-google-client-id-and-client-secret). then, change the `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` & `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables in `.env` file located in `client` server.

Note :bangbang: Node.js server application (`index.js` file located in `server` folder) configuring a Node.js web server to listen for incoming HTTP requests on port `8080`.
reference:
```js
const startServer = async () => {
  try {
    connectDB(process.env.MONGODB_URL);
    app.listen(8080, () => console.log(""Server started on port 8080""));
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
};
```
After following all the instructions above, we'll want to set one last environment variable `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` in `.env` file located in `client` server.
as adapteed to the code, the value of the variable should be
```bash
http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

#### Step 1:
Download or clone this repo by using the link below:

```bash
 https://github.com/ladunjexa/Yariga-Realestate-Dashboard
```

#### Step 2:

Yariga using NPM (Node Package Manager), therefore, make sure that Node.js is installed by execute the following command in consle

```bash
  node -v
```

### Step 3:

Go to root folder and execute the following command in console to get nodemon command line tool: (helps with the speedy development of Node. js applications)

```bash
  npm install -g nodemon
```

### Step 4:

In both folders (`client` / `server`) execute the following command to get the required packages:

```bash
  npm install

## Overview
Real Estate ETL is a data engineering project focused on analyzing the real estate market in India. The project involves collecting and cleaning real estate data from various sources and aims to provide insights into property market across major cities in India. The data has been collected from the [Real Estate Data from 7 Indian Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakkesharv/real-estate-data-from-7-indian-cities) dataset available on Kaggle. The project utilizes Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes to prepare the data for analysis.

## Dashboard (Screenshot)
<img src=""https://github.com/aaryadevg/Real-Estate-ETL/blob/main/dashboard/Dashboard.png"" />

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. Data Collection: Real estate data is collected from the [Real Estate Data from 7 Indian Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakkesharv/real-estate-data-from-7-indian-cities) dataset on Kaggle. The dataset provides comprehensive information about real estate properties in seven major cities in India.

2. Data Cleaning: The collected data undergoes a cleaning process to ensure data quality and consistency. This step involves handling missing values, data normalization, addressing inconsistencies, and standardizing the data format. more information about the procedure can be found in [Data cleaning Notebook](clean.ipynb)

3. Data Storage: The cleaned data is stored in an Excel file. The Excel format provides a convenient and accessible storage solution for the real estate data, enabling easy data manipulation and analysis.

4. Future Plan: Data Analysis with Power BI: In the future, the project plans to perform data analysis using Power BI. Power BI is a business intelligence tool that enables interactive data visualization and reporting. By connecting to the Excel file containing the cleaned real estate data, Power BI will allow for in-depth analysis, creation of interactive dashboards, and generation of visualizations for effective data exploration.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used for data collection and cleaning.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning library in Python.
- Excel: File format used for storing the cleaned real estate data.
- Power BI: Business intelligence tool for data analysis and visualization.

## App
``
streamlit src/run app.py 
``

## How accurate is it?
Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was used to estimate the lower (25%), middle (50%), and upper (75%) ranges by using a quantile loss function.

The model was trained with almost 40.000 listings from April to February in 2022 and is on average over 86% accurate.

The location was restricted to Florian√≥polis, the capital of the state of Santa Catarina, in the South region of Brazil. And only houses and apartments were considered. Duplicated listings or unrealistic selling prices per square meter were excluded. For more details see `config\params.json`

Results on the test data:

| Model | MAE | MAPE | R2 |
| --- | ---| ---| ---|
| Lower bound (0.25) | R$ 218,260.75 | 13.90% | 85.84% |
| Middle bound (0.5)  | R$ 184,260.11 | 13.74% | 89.87% |
| Upper bound (0.75)  | R$ 198,208.98 | 17.96% | 91.33% |
## Data
Data was collected through web-scraping from one of the most representative marketplaces in Brazil the OLX Group.

Geographical features represent the minimum distance (in kilometers) from the nearest point (latitude and longitude) from a given vector or point and the point related to each property. The Haversine formula was used to calculate the distance between points.

Vectors of risky, green, inundation, and bus stop regions were extracted from [the city's Geographic Information Systems (GIS)](http://geoportal.pmf.sc.gov.br/downloads/camadas-em-sig-do-mapa). And the coordinates of health centers, markets, and schools were collected from [Google Maps](https://www.google.com.br/maps).

```
python src/scraper_script.py
```
## Setup

## Limitations and improvements

- Some addresses doesn't have the number of the street, therefore some locations are not exact
- Could do more text classification to create new features or improve others
- Improve scripts, readability, unit testing
- More extensive feature engineering
- The fitted model is too large, reduce it with feature selection
- Improve web-scraper to automate collection for each week ahead
- More hyperparameter tuning

### Software And Tools Requirements

1. [Github Account](https://github.com)
2. [HerokuAccount](https://heroku.com): Heroku is a cloud-based platform that allows developers to deploy, manage, and scale their applications. It was one of the first cloud platforms as a service (PaaS) and has become popular due to its ease of use and scalability.

Developers can use Heroku to deploy web applications written in various programming languages, including Ruby, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP, among others. Heroku supports popular web frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Django, and Express.js.

Heroku manages the infrastructure and servers, so developers can focus on writing code and building their applications. Heroku also provides various tools and add-ons, such as databases, monitoring, and caching services, that developers can use to enhance their applications.

Heroku is widely used by startups, small businesses, and enterprises to deploy and scale their applications quickly and efficiently. It is also popular among developers for its simplicity and ease of use.
    

3. [VSCodeIDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
4. [GitCLI](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)
5. [Postman]: postman is a popular API development tool that simplifies the process of building, testing, documenting, and sharing APIs. It allows developers to send HTTP requests and observe the responses, as well as to set up automated testing and monitoring of APIs.

Postman provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing requests, with options for specifying headers, request parameters, authentication methods, and more. It also includes a powerful testing framework that allows developers to write automated tessts and run them on a collection of APIs.

In addition to its core functionality, Postman offers a number of other features, such as collaboration tools for teams, API documentation generation, and integration with other development tools.

Overall, Postman is a versatile and useful tool for API developers and testers, providing a streamlined and efficient workflow for building and testing APIs.",0,0,1,0,real-estate-website,"[data-science, explainable-ml, iforest, machine-learning, random-forest, real-estate-website]",0

The goal of this project is to use publicly available data from the US Census as well as climate change induced population migration models to identify investment opportunities and public infrastructure needs in communities that will see outsized growth due to the rapidly changing climate.  We will utilize multiple machine learning models to identify areas where capital and investments are most misallocated, initially focusing on real estate values and then possibly extending out into infrastructure needs such as housing units, hospitals, schools, etc.

### Tools used:
  We will primarily be utlizing Python, Sci-kit learn, Numpy, and various ML models to clean, analyze, and present our data and projections.

make it easier to manage the properties/attributes of your class.

Features:

* Inherited properties with class.
* Assign properties from a plain object(JSON Object).
* Clone object.
* Compare object whether is the same.
* Export properties to a plain object(JSON Object).
* Declare properties with type and default value.
  * Supports `arrayOf` property with type
  * Supports property with `template`(the property value is determined by the template content):
    * `template` *{string | (this) => string}*:
      * the template string, eg, `'${author}-${uuid()}'`
      * or customize template function, `function() {return this.author + '-' + uuid()}`
    * `imports`: *{Object}* the optional functions could be used in the template string.
    * **NOTE**: the template property is readonly by default. You can make it writeable.
      Once a new value has been written, the template will be no useful unless the new value is null or undefined.

We often need to manage the properties of an object, consider the following:

* Set the options to the properties of object when the object was created
  * `var myObj = new MyObject({opt1:value1, opt2:value2})`
* Assign the options from another object:
  * `myObj.assign({opt1:v1, opt2:v2})`
* Clone an object:
  * `var newObj = myObj.clone()`
* Compare two objects whether is the same by their options(assigned properties).
  * `myObj.isSame(anotherObj)`
* Export the properties as a plain object or JSON to make recreate the object easier in the future.
  * There are some internal attributes should not be exported.
  * The empty or default value of an attribute should not be exported.
  * the meaningful(non-english) name should be exported and assigned.
  * `myObj.toObject()` and `myObj.toJSON()`
  * `JSON.stringify(myObj)`

1. Problem: how to assign an object value of a property?
   * replace the standard `assignPropertyTo()` method.
   * define the attribute's `assign(value, dest, src, name)` method on the `$attributes`.
     * the custom attribute's `assign` the value. return the changed value.
2. Problem: how to decide which property should be assign or get default value of an attribute?
   1. define all attributes on this object even though the value is null.
      * no default value feature.
   2. define a simple `$attributes` property to manage this:
      * {attrName: {value:'defaultValue'}, ...}
   3. define a complex `$attributes`(use `Properties` class) to manage attributes.

So we have these classes: SimplePropertyManager,NormalPropertyManager and AdvancePropertyManager.

first the rules of the properties:

* exported attributes means they are the JSON.stringify(aObj) attributes only.
* The non-enumerable attributes can not be exported and assigned.
* The enumerable attributes beginning with '$' can not be exported. but can be assigned.
* `undefined` value can not be exported.
* the readonly(writable is false) attributes can not be assigned.
* the assignment order of properties is the order of defined properties.

### You can inherit from it

* SimplePropertyManager: /lib/simple
  * use the object's property descriptor directly.
  * so do not support default value.
  * do not support object value assignment hook function.
  * do not support meaningful(non-english) name.
* NormalPropertyManager: /lib/normal
  * use the `$attributes` plain object to hold the declaration properties
  * support default value.
  * support object value assignment hook function.
  * support meaningful(non-english) name.
* AdvancePropertyManager: /lib/advance
  * use the `$attributes` to hold the declaration properties
  * the `$attributes` is an instance of `Properties` class.
  * so you can custom your `Properties` class inherited from.
  * support default value.
  * support object value assignment hook function.
  * support meaningful(non-english) name.
  * support type check if possible.

The `$attributes` holds all attributes(like the property descriptor) of an object.
The `key` is the property name. the value is the property descriptor:

* name *(String)*: the non-english name to export, Defaults to the `key` name.
* value: the property's default value if exists. Defaults to `undefined`.
* type *(String)*: the property's type name. defaults to undefined.
* enumerable *(Boolean)*: defaults to true
  * true if and only if this property shows up during enumeration of
    the properties on the corresponding object.
* configurable *(Boolean)*: defaults to true
  * true if and only if the type of this property descriptor may be changed
    and if the property may be deleted from the corresponding object.
* writable *(Boolean)*: defaults to true
  * true if and only if the value associated with the property may be changed
    with an assignment operator.
* assign *(Function(value, dest, src, name))*:the custom attribute assignment function.
  just `return` the changed value. defaults to undefined.
  It means do not assign this value if return `undefined`
  * **Note**: It only used on assign the options from another object.
  * It's no effect if the assign the property individually. use the property descriptor `set` to do so.
  * Wrap it as smart-assign feature(only on Advance Property Manager):
    * add a hidden internal property with prefix automatically
    * add descriptor `get` function to read the property automatically
    * add descriptor `set` function to assign the property(call the `assign` descriptor) automatically.
* only available on Normal and Advance Property Manager:
  * `assigned` *(Boolean)*: whether the property can be assigned. defaults: undefined
    * if undefined then `=enumerable isn't false and (writable isn't false or isFunction(set))`
  * **Smart Assign Support** only available on AdvancePropertyManager
    * `assigned` *(Boolean|String)*: enable smart-assign support when the assigned is string
    * it uses the `nonExported1stChar+name` as the internal property name if the string is empty
    * the `assigned` string is the internal property name if it's non-empty.
  * `exported` *(Boolean)*: whether the property can be exported. defaults: undefined
    * if `undefined` then `=enumerable isn't false and the first char isn't ""$""`
  * `alias` *(String|ArrayOf String)*: add the alias(es) to the property. It used via assignment from options.
  * `clone` *(Boolean)*: Whether clone default property value if the value is an object when initializing.
    defaults to true.

```js

'$attributes': {
  'attrName': {
    name: 'exportedName',
    value: 123,
    enumerable: false,
    type: 'String',
    configurable: true,
    writable: true,
    assign: function(value, dest, src, name)
    get: ...,
    set: ....
  }
}
```

### Or inject it as an ability

these methods will be added(replaced):

* `initialize(options)` : overwrite this for assign options from constructor?
  * apply the initialized value of the properties to the object if possible.
  * then call `assign` method.
+ `assign(options)` : assign the options' attributes to this object.
  * how to decide which attribute should be assign?
  * I need an attributes manage class? or just a simple attributes list?
  * or define all attributes even the value is null when initialize
  * this must be an optional feature.
+ `assignPropertyTo(dest, options, attributeName, value)`: assign an attribute to dest.
  * you can override it to determine howto assign an object value.
+ `assignProperty(options, attributeName, value)`: assign an atrribute. called by `assign`
* `assignTo(dest)` : assign the attributes to this `dest` object.
* `mergeTo(dest)`: merge the attributes itself to `dest` object.
  * do not overwrite the already exist attributes of the `dest`.
* `isSame(obj)`: compare the `obj`'s attributes whether is the same value with itself.
* `clone(options)`: create a new object with the same attributes' value.
* `toObject(options)`: convert it as plain object.
  * do not export the non-enumerable attributes or beginning with '$'
  * do not export the attribute's value is null
  * do not export the attribute's value is default value.
    * where to get the default value?
* `toJSON()`: this will call the `toObject()` to return.

Note: you should specify the position of the argument if the first argument is not the options

## Usage

### Make your class manage the properties

there are two ways to make your class manage the attributes.

* Class inherits from
  * inherits from PropertyManager directly.
* Ability to hook on any class
  * You need confirm these method names are not be used.
    The `$attributes` is used via normal and advance PropertyManager.
    the `nonExported1stChar` is used to change the first char of non-exported
    property, defaults to '$'. It must be exist.
    The first four methods must be exist. others are optional.
    But be care of their dependencies.
    1. $attributes (unless use simple PropertyManager)
    2. nonExported1stChar
    3. assign
    4. assignPropertyTo
    5. getProperties
    6. defineProperties
    7. clone (optional)
       * mergeTo
    8. initialize (optional)
       * getProperties
       * assign
    9. assignProperty (optional)
       * assignPropertyTo
    10. mergeTo (optional)
        * getProperties
        * assignPropertyTo
    11. exportTo (optional)
        * mergeTo
    12. assignTo (optional)
        * getProperties
        * assignPropertyTo
    13. toObject (optional)
        * exportTo
    14. toJSON (optional)
        * toObject
    15. isSame (optional)
        * mergeTo

#### Class Inherits

there are three PropertyManager class to use, the default is NormalPropertyManager.

```coffee
inherits = require 'inherits-ex/lib/inherits'
PropertyManager = require 'property-manager' # the default is normal
PropertyManager = require 'property-manager/lib/normal'
SimplePropertyManager = require 'property-manager/lib/simple'
AdvancePropertyManager = require 'property-manager/lib/advance'

# Only for Normal or Advance PropertyManager
defineProperties = ProperManager.defineProperties

class MyClass
  inherits MyClass, PropertyManager
  # if you use normal or advance property manager
  # you can define your properties here to:
  defineProperties MyClass, {
    'attr1': {value:123}
    'hidden': {value:1, enumerable: false}
    '$dontExport': {value:3, enumerable: true}
    'custom':
      value:{}
      assign:(value, dest, src, name)->
        value?={}
        value.exta = 123
        return value
  }
  constructor: (@name, options)->
    # if you use the SimplePropertyManager
    # you should define your properties here:
    #@defineProperties {
    #  'attr1': {value:123}
    #  'hidden': {value:1, enumerable: false}
    #  '$dontExport': {value:3, enumerable: true}
    #}
    super options

class MyClassEx
  inherits MyClassEx, MyClass
  defineProperties MyClassEx, {'extra': {value: 'extra'}}
  constructor: ->super

```
the following is javascript:

```js
var inherits = require('inherits-ex/lib/inherits');
var PropertyManager = require('property-manager');
var PropertyManager = require('property-manager/lib/normal');
var SimplePropertyManager = require('property-manager/lib/simple');
var AdvancePropertyManager = require('property-manager/lib/advance');

//# Only for Normal or Advance PropertyManager
var defineProperties = ProperManager.defineProperties

function MyClass(name, options) {
  this.name = name;
  // if you use the SimplePropertyManager
  // you should define your properties here:
  //this.defineProperties({
  //  'attr1': {value:123}
  //  'hidden': {value:1, enumerable: false},
  //  '$dontExport': {value:3, enumerable: true}
  //})
  PropertyManager.call(this, options);
}

inherits(MyClass, PropertyManager);

//only for normal, advance property manager
defineProperties(MyClass, {
    'attr1': {value:123},
    'hidden': {value:1, enumerable: false},
    '$dontExport': {value:3, enumerable: true},
    'custom': {
      value: {},
      assign: function(value, dest, src, name) {
        if (value == null) {
          value = {};
        }
        value.exta = 123;
        return value;
      }
    }
});

function MyClassEx() {
  MyClassEx.__super__.constructor.apply(this, arguments)
}
inherits(MyClassEx, MyClass);
defineProperties(MyClassEx, {'extra': {value: 'extra'}});


```

#### Ability to hook on any class

```coffee
propertyManager = require 'property-manager/ability'

class MyClass
  # add the property manager ability to MyClass
  # the default is normal property manager
  #   propertyManager MyClass
  # you can specified the property manager 'simple', 'advance', 'normal':
  #   propertyManager MyClass, 'simple'
  #   propertyManager MyClass, name: 'simple'
  # and you can specified the options position in the arguments
  propertyManager MyClass, optionsPosition: 1
  # you can exclude some non-core methods
  # propertyManager MyClass, optionsPosition: 1, exclude: ['assignTo', ...]
  # if you use normal or advance property manager
  # you can define your properties here to:
  defineProperties = MyClass.defineProperties
  defineProperties MyClass, {
    'attr1': {value:123}
    'hidden': {value:1, enumerable: false}
    '$dontExport': {value:3, enumerable: true}
    'date':
      assign: (value, dest, src, name, {isExported}) ->
        if isExported
          value.toISOString()
        else if !(value instanceof Date)
          new Date(value)
        else
          value
    'custom':
      value:{}
      assign:(value, dest, src, name, opts)->
        value?={}
        value.exta = 123
        return value
  }
  constructor: (@name, options)->
    # if you use the SimplePropertyManager
    # you should define your properties here:
    #@defineProperties {
    #  'attr1': {value:123, enumerable: true}
    # 'hidden': {value:1, enumerable: false}
    # '$dontExport': {value:3, enumerable: false}
    #}
    @initialize.apply @, arguments

class MyClassEx
  inherits MyClassEx, MyClass
  defineProperties MyClassEx, {'extra': {value: 'extra'}}
  constructor: ->super

```

the following is javascript:

```js
var propertyManager = require('property-manager/ability');

function MyClass(name, options) {
  // if you use the SimplePropertyManager
  // you should define your properties here:
  //this.defineProperties({
  //  'attr1': {value:123}
  //  'hidden': {value:1, enumerable: false},
  //  '$dontExport': {value:3, enumerable: false}
  //})
  this.name = name;
  this.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
}

// you can exclude some non-core methods:
//propertyManager(MyClass, {optionsPosition:1, exclude: ['assignTo', ...]})
propertyManager(MyClass, {optionsPosition: 1});
var defineProperties = MyClass.defineProperties;

//only for normal, advance property manager
defineProperties(MyClass, {
  'attr1': {value: 123},
  'hidden': {value: 1, enumerable: false},
  '$dontExport': {value: 3, enumerable: true},
  'date': {
    assign(value, dest, src, name, {isExported}) {
      let result;
      if (isExported) {
        result = value.toISOString()
      } else if (!(value instanceof Date)) {
        result = new Date(value)
      }
      return result;
    }
  }
  'custom': {
    value: {},
    assign: function(value, dest, src, name, opts) {
      if (value == null) {
        value = {};
      }
      value.exta = 123;
      return value;
    }
  }
});

function MyClassEx() {
  MyClassEx.__super__.constructor.apply(this, arguments)
}
inherits(MyClassEx, MyClass);
defineProperties(MyClassEx, {'extra': {value: 'extra'}});

```

### Use the Property Manager

Now the `MyClass` class should have four attributes

* attr1: can be exported and assigned
* hidden: can not be exported and assigned
* $dontExport: can be assigned, can not be exported.
* custom: can be exported and assigned, the value be changed by
  `assign` function in the property descriptor.

the `MyClassEx` inherits from `MyClass` (NOTE: only for normal or advance property manager)

* extra: can be exported and assigned.
* others inherit from `MyClass`

```coffee
assert = require 'assert'
my = new MyClass 'aName', attr1: 3, hidden:11222, $dontExport: 1, custom:{b:12}
assert.deepEqual my.mergeTo(), attr1:3, $dontExport:1, custom:{b:12, exta: 123}
assert.equal my.hidden, 1 # the `hidden` can not be assigned and exported
assert.deepEqual my.toObject(), attr1:3 # the `$dontExport` can not be exported
assert.equal JSON.stringify(my), '{""attr1"":3,""custom"":{""b"":12,""exta"":123}}'

obj = my.clone()
assert.ok obj.isSame(my) # compare each assigned properties.
assert.deepEqual obj.mergeTo(), attr1:3, $dontExport:1, custom:{b:12, exta: 123}

myEx = new MyClassEx 'theClassEx', attr1: 3, hidden:11222, $dontExport: 1, custom:{b:12}
assert.deepEqual myEx.mergeTo(), extra:'extra', attr1:3, $dontExport:1, custom:{b:12, exta: 123}
```

the following is javascript:

```js
var assert = require('assert');

var my = new MyClass('aName', {
  attr1: 3,
  hidden: 11222,
  $dontExport: 1,
  custom: {
    b: 12
  }
});

assert.deepEqual(my.mergeTo(), {
  attr1: 3,
  $dontExport: 1,
  custom: {
    b: 12,
    exta: 123
  }
});

assert.equal(my.hidden, 1);

assert.deepEqual(my.toObject(), {
  attr1: 3
});

assert.equal(JSON.stringify(my), '{""attr1"":3,""custom"":{""b"":12,""exta"":123}}');

var obj = my.clone();

assert.ok(obj.isSame(my));

assert.deepEqual(obj.mergeTo(), {
  attr1: 3,
  $dontExport: 1,
  custom: {
    b: 12,
    exta: 123
  }
});
```

### v1.4.0

* feat: add the readonly to smart assigned property

```ts
@Properties
class Phone extends AdvancePropertyManager {
  @Prop({
    writable: false,
    exported: true,
    assigned: '',
  }) id!: string;
}
```

* **BROKEN CHANGE**: DO NOT EXPORT the readonly property by default unless exported is true.

```ts
@Properties
class Phone extends AdvancePropertyManager {
  @Prop({
    writable: false,
    exported: true,
  }) id!: string;
}
```


### v1.0.0

+ add the array with type supports.

```ts
import { arrayOf } from 'property-manager/lib/array';
import AdvancePropertyManager from 'property-manager/lib/advance';
import { PropertyManager as Properties, Property as Prop } from 'property-manager-decorator';

@Properties
class Phone extends AdvancePropertyManager {
  @Prop() value!: string;
  @Prop() codeNum!: string;
  @Prop() kind!: string;
  constructor(initValue?) {
    super(initValue);
  }
}

@Properties
class Contact extends AdvancePropertyManager {
  @Prop({type: String}) name!: string;
  @Prop({type: arrayOf(Phone)}) phones!: Phone[];
  constructor(initValue?) {
    super(initValue);
  }
}
```
* **BROKEN** change `toObject` method params to `(options?: IMergeOptions)`
* **BROKEN** change `assign` method params to `(src, options?: IMergeOptions)`
* **BROKEN** change `assignTo` method params to `(dest, options?: IMergeOptions)`
* **BROKEN** change `assignPropertyTo` and `assignProperty` method params to `(dest, src, name: string, value, attrs?, options?: IMergeOptions)`
* **BROKEN** change `exportTo` method params to `(dest, options?: IExportOptions)`
* **BROKEN** change `mergeTo` method params to `(dest, options?: IMergeOptions)`
  + add `skipNull` and `skipUndefined` option to `IExportOptions` and `IMergeOptions`
+ add the `extends(attrs: Object, nonExported1stChar)` method to the `Properties`
  * return a new `Properties` instance to extends properties from current instance.
+ add the inherited properties supports for `AdvancePropertyManager.defineProperties`
* change the `recreate` argument default value of `defineProperties` to `false` for `AdvancePropertyManager` and `NormalPropertyManager`
* set all methods and non-properties of `Properties` to be non-enumerable.

### v0.13.0

+ add typed property for `AdvancePropertyManager` and `NormalPropertyManager`

```js
function CustomType(value) {
  if (!(this instanceof CustomType)) return new CustomType(value)
  try {
    value = JSON.parse(value)
  } catch(err) {
    this.value = value
  }
}

const attrs = {
  prop1: {type: CustomType, value: 111}
}

class TypedPM extends AdvancePropertyManager {
  constructor(opts) {
    super(opts)
  }
}
TypedPM.defineProperties(attrs)

const obj = new TypedPM()
console.log(obj.prop1 instanceof CustomType)
```

### v0.11.0

+ add the `skipExists` option to the `Properties.assignTo` and `Properties.assignPropertyTo`
* the options to the `Properties.assignTo(dest, src, options)`
  * `exclude`*(String|Array)*
  * `skipDefault`*(Boolean)*
  * `skipExists`*(Boolean)*
  * `skipReadOnly`*(Boolean)*
  * `exported`*(Boolean)*

### v0.10.0

+ add the alias property descriptor(Normal&Advance):
  * You can define one or more aliases to assign from other object(options)
  * `alias` *(String|ArrayOf String)*
* Smart assignment property supports(AdvancePropertyManager):
  * **broken**: SMART_ASSIGN constant deprecated.
  * `assigned` descriptor *(Boolean|String)*:
    * `String` means SMART_ASSIGN.
    * it's the internal property name of the smart assignment if it's string
    * the internal property name is the property name with prefix(`nonExported1stChar`)
      if it's an empty string
- **broken**: remove `attrsName` property(fixed to '$attributes')
+ add the helper function: properties/define-properties.

### v0.9.0

* clone default property value if the value is an object when initializing
  * the object instances will share the same one of property value if the default value of property is an object.
    * howto create a new object instance when initializing default value.
    * Solution 1: the `value` descriptor could be a function to create new object instance:
      * Problem1: it will be only available for normal and advance property manager
        * `value: function (){return Object.create()}`
      * Problem2: the value can not be a function now.
    * Solution 2: check the value whether is object. if so, clone it when initializing.
      * use this solution. but if someone wish all instance share the same value.
      * add a descriptor to control whethe enable this. but simple can not support the custom descriptor.
        + `clone` *(Boolean)*: defaults to true.
+ Smart assignment property supports:
  * assign property descriptor *(Function(value, dest, src, name))*:
    * It only used to assign the options from another object.
    * It's no effect if the assign the property individually. should use the property descriptor `set` to do so.
    * maybe I should wrap it:
      * add a hidden internal property with prefix(`nonExported1stChar`)
      * add descriptor `get` function to read the property
      * add descriptor `set` function to assign the property(call the `assign` descriptor).
    * need a descriptor to control whethe enable this.
      + `assigned`: AdvancePropertyManager::SMART_ASSIGN = 2
      * enabled: `!get and !set and assigned is AdvancePropertyManager::SMART_ASSIGN`
    * only available for advance property manager.
    * **note**: only `value` argument is passed into `assign` descriptor when assignment the property individually.

### v0.8.0

+ add the property writable check: do not assign the readonly property.
* Normal, Advance
  + add the `assigned`, `exported` *(Boolean)* to property descriptor directly.
    * `assigned`: enumerable isnt false and (writable isnt false or isFunction(set)).
    * `exported`: enumerable isnt false and the first char isnt ""$""
+ `PropertyManager::nonExported1stChar` *(Char)*, defaults to '$'
  * note: the `exported` descriptor is higher prior than `nonExported1stChar`.
+ `nonExported1stChar` option to the property manager ability.

### v0.7.0

* **broken** the arguments order of assign function in property descriptor are changed:
  * attr.assign(value, dest, src, name, opts) instead of assign(dest, src, value, name)

# Environment variables

They are securely managed in AWS's [parameter store](https://ap-southeast-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=ap-southeast-1#Parameters:sort=Name). The variables are retrieved via [an environment setup script](https://github.com/unee-t/frontend/blob/master/aws-env.dev), which is utilised by `deploy.sh`.

For local development, use `./env-setup.bash` assuming you have been access to the `uneet-dev` development environment.

# Deployment

Happens automatically on master on the development AWS account 8126-4485-3088
with AWS_PROFILE `uneet-dev`. Travis CI deployments made via pull request will fail since it will
not have access to `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

Production deployment on AWS account 1924-5899-3663 is done manually via
`./deploy.sh -p` via the AWS_PROFILE `aws-prod` only once the **build is tagged**.

# Debugging with VScode

[Background reading](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/blob/master/meteor/README.md#configure-meteor-to-run-in-debug-mode)

* `cd .vscode; curl -O https://media.dev.unee-t.com/2018-07-05/launch.json` for example, edit this to point to where your browser binary lives
* `npm run debug`... you need to run this manually on the CLI
* Meteor: Node to attach & debug server side
* Meteor: Chrome to debug client side

# Logs

```

## Start App
```shell
npm start
```

# Tips

## How do I figure out the email of the logged in user?

Run in browser's developer console:

	Meteor.user().emails[0].address

## How to find user account on MongoDB given an email address foo@example.com?

	./backup/connect.sh
	db.users.findOne({'emails.address': 'foo@example.com'})

## How do I set up for local development?

1. Make a backup snapshot of the development Mongo database using `backup/dump.sh`
2. `meteor reset` to clear state
3. `npm run start` to start the mongo service
3. `mongorestore -h 127.0.0.1 --port 3001 -d meteor $(date ""+dev-%Y%m%d"")/meteor`

## How to create users in the case my MongoDB is lacking the users?

To check the current users, connect to your MongoDB and run:

	db.users.find({}, {'emails.address': 1, _id: 0}).map(d => d.emails[0].address).join('\n')

If your Frontend datastore MongoDB out of sync with your [Bugzilla database's
profiles](https://documentation.unee-t.com/2018/03/01/introduction-to-the-demo-environment/),
you need to create the users in the users manually:

	Accounts.createUser({ email: 'leonel@mailinator.com', password: 'leonel', profile: { bzLogin: 'leonel@mailinator.com', bzPass: 'leonel' }})

Ensure it worked by looking at the `npm start` log. Next you might want to verify each user's email address.

	db.users.update({'emails.address': 'leonel@mailinator.com'}, {$set : {'emails.0.verified': true}})

## How to test the notifications / email templates?

Refer to
[simulate.sh](https://github.com/unee-t/lambda2sns/blob/master/tests/simulate.sh)
though you need to tweak the
[events](https://github.com/unee-t/lambda2sns/tree/master/tests/events) to map
to the bugzillaCreds **id** from `db.users.find().pretty()`

## Migrations: Not migrating, control is locked.

	Migrations.unlock()
	Migrations.migrateTo('latest')

## error: Error: url must be absolute and start with http:// or https://

Your `.env` file is not set up correctly, consider `./env-setup.bash`

## Mail sending

The secret **MAIL_URL** environment variable configures the SMTP, so that email
notifications can be sent. For example in **uneet-dev** environment, it begins
with `smtps://AKIAIICB7IAWDIGLY6DA..` and you can search for the **Access key
ID** _AKIAIICB7IAWDIGLY6DA_ in [AWS
IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home) to determine if it's active
or not in <https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=us-west-2#>.

To help with debugging, there is a [setup mail
script](https://github.com/unee-t/email2case/blob/master/tests/setup-mail-to.sh)
to exercise **MAIL_URL**.

{idealista18} is an open data product with big geo-referenced micro-data
sets of 2018 real estate listings in Spain. These data were originally
published on the idealista.com real estate website. The data sets are
for the three largest cities in Spain: Madrid (n = 94,815 observations),
Barcelona (n = 61,486 observations), and Valencia (n = 33,622
observations), and include approximate coordinates of properties
(latitude and longitude), asking prices of each listed dwelling, and
several variables of indoor characteristics. The listings were enriched
with official information from the Spanish cadastre (e.g., building
material quality) plus other relevant geographical features, such as
distance to urban points of interest. Along with the real estate
listings, the data product also includes neighborhood boundaries for
each city. The data sets are offered as a fully documented R package and
are available for scientific and educational purposes, particularly for
geo-spatial studies.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of idealista18 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages(""idealista18"")
```
-->

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages(""devtools"")
devtools::install_github(""paezha/idealista18"")
```

# Data description

There are nine data objects in the package: three objects for each of
the cities included. For each city, dwelling listings, neighborhood
polygons, and a set of points of interest have been included in the R
package. The following subsections describe each object. A full
description of the data is available in the help section of the package.

library(skimr) 
```

## Dwelling listings

The dwelling listing of each city includes a set of characteristics for
each dwelling published on the idealista real estate website as an ad.
The dwelling listing has been included in the ‚Äòidealista18‚Äô package as
an sf object. The name of the sf object containing the dwelling listing
includes the name of the city, followed by ‚Äô\_Sale‚Äô (e.g., Madrid_Sale)
and includes a total of 42 variables. Each sf object includes the
complete set of listings corresponding to the four quarters of the year
2018. Table shows the number of dwelling listing ads included in the
data set for each city and quarter. The record counts for each city are:
94,815 listings for Madrid, 61,486 for Barcelona, and 33,622 for
Valencia. Note that the same dwelling may be found in more than one
period when a property listed for sale in one quarter was sold in a
subsequent quarter. The variable ASSETID, included in the sf objects, is
the unique identifier of the dwelling.

## Neighboorhood polygons

The second block of data included in the ‚Äòidealista18‚Äô R package is the
spatial features of the three cities divided into neighborhoods. There
is an sf object for each city with the name of the city and the suffix
‚Äô\_Polygons‚Äô. Figure shows the quantile maps of the number of dwellings
in the listing for the different neighborhoods in the three cities. The
neighborhoods are based on the official boundaries but slightly changed
by Idealista. In practical terms, we can assume they are the same since
the website combines areas when there are few ads for that area. In the
case of Madrid, they combined four areas into two.

There are a total of 69 neighborhoods in Barcelona, 135 in Madrid, and
73 in Valencia. The sf object includes a unique identifier (LOCATIONID)
and the neighborhood name (LOCATIONNAME).

## Points of Interest

The last block of data included in the data package is a set of Points
of Interest in each city as an object of the class list. The name of the
list includes the name of the city with the suffix ‚Äô\_POIS‚Äô. These lists
include three elements: (i) the coordinates of the city center, the
central business district; (ii) a set of coordinates that define the
main street of each city; and (iii) the coordinates of the metro
stations.

MLP99,NYC-PSP,,https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP,https://api.github.com/repos/NYC-PSP/MLP99,Repo for my machine learning project where I built a machine learning model that could predict prices for properties in New York City.,"# New York City Property Sales Predictor (PSP)
For this personal project, I built a machine learning model in Python that could predict prices for properties in New York City. The reason why I did this project is that I'm very interested in real estate and wanted to know more about this domain and learn more about machine learning. Besides the dataset about the properties, I'm using another dataset with demographic information about the NYC population and merged them to predict property prices.
This project is divided into 3 sections: [EDA](https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP/blob/main/files/NYC_PSP_EDA.ipynb), [data preparation](https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP/blob/main/files/NYC_PSP_PREPARATION.ipynb) and [model building](https://github.com/MLP99/NYC-PSP/blob/main/files/NYC_PSP_MODELLING.ipynb). I achieved the following things:

* Completed an Exploratory Data Analysis on the 80,000 properties in the dataset
* Built a machine learning model that could predict property prices in New York City
* Achieved a decrease of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from the properties in the validation data by 48% (~ $92.400,00) by only using Feature Engineering


## Conclusion
After doing this project I learned the following. Although I didn't deploy this model into production, I found this project a great exercise to learn more about data analysis, data preparation and model building. Due to the EDA, I learned more about this domain and what kind of data I was dealing with such as the different properties that exist in NYC and what the price difference was between the boroughs. From data preparation, I learned more about how I'm preprocessing my data like merging different datasets & how to remove outliers. Removing outliers made my brain work to get the data in a better format. From model building, I learned more about feature engineering and what kind of impact that could have on your model performance.

My next step for this project is to use hyperparameter tuning to improve my model's performance and use gradient boosters for example XGBoost that also could help in the process of achieving better results. After building a great model I would like to deploy it and use it in a web application where a user can use it to predict property prices.

## Data 
Data I used in this project:

* New York City property sales dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-property-sales
* New York City census dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/muonneutrino/new-york-city-census-data
## EDA
In this section, I would like to highlight a few visualizations that I made in my EDA with the Seaborn library for Python.

RichardSchulz52,immopush,,https://github.com/RichardSchulz52/immopush,https://api.github.com/repos/immopush/RichardSchulz52,Polls on websites to push new offers to a telegram bot,"# immopush
This project implements a Telegram-Bot that fetches information from real estate websites, recognizes new entries, and pushes them to a telegram chat. 
It is currently supporting the german websites ebay-kleinanzeigen, immowelt and immonet. The bot is protected from beeing used by unauthorized users. 
If you are hosting it yourself you can be sure no one floods your server with search requests. I am running my own instance. If you want to use it message me :)

## How to use it
First open a Chat with the Bot or add it to a group. Than you have certain commands for search requests and administration (if you own the Bot).
### search request commands
- /add url 
  - replace url with the url in your browser. Go to the website you want to search on and configure the search filter. All filter information will be parsed to the url in the browser header. Copy the url and add it to the Bot. Make sure you klick on search before copying. Otherwise you might not have the latest filter change in the url.
- /display
  - this shows your current search requests. Each url has an identification number.
- /delete number
  - replace number with the identification number of the request you want to delete. Use the display command to get the identification numbers.

### administration
If you realy want to run your own server message me and I will provide the description here. 

## How to setup the server

A ShinyR app for analyzing recently sold data from Redfin.com to find comparables of homes you maybe interested in purchasing.

# Technologies
* R, RStudio
* Libraries - Shiny, DT, data.table
* ShinyApps.io to host ShinyR app

# How To
## Use App
Once published, click on any row in the table. This will redirect you to the ""Comparables"" tab to find similar houses and you can get the average price among all the comparables found. 

Example
![Preview of househunt app](/HouseHunt_Preview.png)

## Run App
* Open househunt.Rproj in RStudio
* ui -> this is the tabs rendered on the page
* server -> this is the main filter logic used to update the UI

## Publish
Use your own [ShinyApps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) account to publish if you wish to access this app on your mobile device. My version of this is published in https://navinvarma.shinyapps.io/househunt/. 

## Update Data
* Go to [Redfin.com](https://www.redfin.com/) and search for your county of choice. This app uses Alameda County, CA for demonstration.
* See screenshot on how to download CSV to local repo

![Image from Redfin.com search results to download CSV file](/Redfin_CSV_HowTo.png)

Overwrite CSV Files are located at:
* [redfin_forsale.csv](/redfin_forsale.csv)
* [redfin_recentlysold.csv](/redfin_recentlysold.csv)

# Credits
This app uses sample data from [Redfin.com](https://www.redfin.com/) using the ""Download All"" to CSV from the search results. Real Estate software and licensing API is expensive, so this is a hacked together solution for local development and personal use.

# Additional Notes
This app was originally developed in 2018 around the time I was in the market to buy a home in the East Bay. It was a personal project that was lying around, and moved between PCs. In the interest of keeping this record somewhere in the cloud and for the benefit of other home buyers, I'm finally pushing this up to GitHub. Hoping you find your dream home at the right price using this app!

stefcenti2022,RealLeads,,https://github.com/stefcenti2022/RealLeads,https://api.github.com/repos/RealLeads/stefcenti2022,RealLeads Provides the Data Analysis Tools to Help Buy or Sell a Home.,"# RealLeads

<img src=""./Resources/images/headerfor_readm.png"" alt=""RealLeads HomeWise Header"" width=""500""/>

## Overview

The real estate industry has a significant impact on the American economy. There are several indicators that affect real estate sales such as location, property characteristics and the economy including the job market, economic cycle and interest rates etc. These indicators help us the determine current approximate value of the property.

Whether you are a buyer, seller, agent or investor, everyone has similar questions:

- How much can I sell my home for?
- How fast can my house be sold?

In this project we are creating a real-world simulation. While we are trying to find an answer for these questions.
We have established a hypothetical company called REALLEADS which is a real estate focused fintech company that works as a matchmaker between agents and home sellers. RealLeads has been in business for about five years. Their initial product was the ‚ÄúRealLeads Agent Console‚Äù, a portal that serves up home seller leads and also acts as a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) database for agents.

Now that RealLeads has been in business successfully for five years, investors want to see product expansion and increased revenue. Our RealLeads data and product development team has been tasked with coming up with a new idea that can be monetized.
Our team, RealLeads proposes creating a new portal, this time targeted at retail clients themselves. . The portal, ‚ÄúRealLeads Homewise‚Äù, will help home sellers get a sense of at what price they might list their home for, what to expect for a sold price, and also get a sense of the number of days a home can be expected to stay on the market.

The tool will capture user data which can be monetized by RealLeads, and there is also a click to call/email feature that puts the Seller/user in touch with an agent who pays for the lead, and provides an additional revenue source for RealLeads.

## Description of Data Source

We used:

- Multi Listing Service Data (MLS) (2019-2022)
- Public Record (PD)
- Mortgage Data (MD)
- Census Data (CD)
- APIs ‚Äì Google Maps

ETL Processes:

- Selection/cleansing
- PostgresSQL Database
- Tables use MLSNumber as primary key
- Connections using psycopg2

## Tools Used

Languages:
Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL

Software:
VS Code, JupyterNotebook, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, psycopg2, Flask, pgAdmin4, HTML, CSS, Matplotlib, Plotly, Pickle, Seaborn, Figma

## Machine Learning Model

### Supervised

We start predicting the listing price first and followed with sold price and the date range, because each machine learning builds off of each other that requires the previous model‚Äôs information.

Eighty percent of the data is being used to train the model while the remaining twenty percent is used to test the model. Once that is done we begin testing on multiple models.

Predicting the list price:

<img src=""./Resources/images/modelslistprice.png"" alt=""Prediction Results"" width=""500""/>

List Price Prediction Results:

RandomForestRegressor model is being the best option, we decided to attempt one more method which is scaling our data with a StandardScaler. StandardScaler is used to reallocate the distribution of values so that the mean is 0 and the Standard Deviation is 1. Model accuracy became 75%

Predicted Sold Price:

To predict the sold price of the house which we add the original list price to our existing data table to help figure out what the prediction on what the house would be sold for. Because of built in fuctions and retraining on random states we decided to stick with Random Forest Regressor. Model accuracy: 86%

<img src=""./Resources/images/ML_Graphs/overall_diff_orig_zipcode.png"" alt=""Prediction Results by zipcode"" width=""500""/>

Predicting the Days On Market:

<img src=""./Resources/images/modelsdaysonmarket.png"" alt=""Day on Market Prediction Results"" width=""500""/>

We decided to use Balanced Random Forest Regressor with 70% model accuracy and used 2 buckets as ""Less Than 2 Months"" and ""More Than 2 Months"" to be able to provide an information to seller.

### Unsupervised Machine Learning

This step was an optional steps for RealLeads team, but we wanted to see if we can find any correlation with the data points, we have by clustering data points using unsupervised learning. We used a different data table compared to the supervised machine learning model where we included majority of columns of data to see if there are any findings within the data. Once the data was cleaned, we began to use a method called the Principal Component Analysis(PCA) which performs a dimensionality reduction on our data table and normalize it.

<img src=""./Resources/images/elbow_curve.png"" alt=""Elbow Curve"" width=""500""/>

## Results and Conclusion

In conclusion, we were able to connect MLS and public record data to use in predicting suggested list Price, expected sold price, and expected days on market. We achieved this task by using a microcosm of the United States, New Castle County, Delaware.

In the future, we will enhance user interaction with our three machine learning models. Additionally, we plan to enhance map and data retrieval to give an improved user expirience. We will also include click to call, email, and text buttons to connect with an agent, and build out and productionalize our prototype.

## Homewise Application Release Notes

- To install packages run `pip install -r requirements`
- Create the following Config files:
  - In the leads_map folder add config.py with `mapbox_token` set to your token for mapbox. Without this token the map used in the app will fail to render.
  - In the static/js/folder add confit.js with `API_KEY` set to your Google maps API. This may not be necessary since this route is no longer accessed by the app but the code for the route still exists in GitHub and may fail if this file is not found.
- Export the env var SECRET_KEY to any random string. This is needed to keep client-side sessions secure. In a future release, this will be set automatically as suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34902378/where-do-i-get-secret-key-for-flask. See Sessions documentation for more info. https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/quickstart/#sessions
- To start the application use `flask run`

The application is a work in progress so if any issues are found, please feel free to contact our team!

### About	
This project is proposed as a potential solution to the data management issues for Real Estate Agents
and will allow agents to store their real estate related data upon a single web based application uniformally thus avoiding
unecessary segrementation of their data online.


### Major Requirements
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14.15.0 (<i>Or Higher)</i>
* [React - Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) v17.0.1 (<i>Or Higher)</i>
* [Firebase Package for NPM/Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) v8.0.1 (<i>Or Higher)</i>

### Back-End Package.JSON Requirements (In the use-case that npm install does not work when within the back-end directory)
```json
""dependencies"": {
    ""busboy"": ""^0.3.1"",
    ""cors"": ""^2.8.5"",
    ""firebase"": ""^8.0.1"",
    ""firebase-admin"": ""^9.2.0"",
    ""firebase-functions"": ""^3.11.0"",
    ""uuid"": ""^8.3.1"",
    ""uuid-v4"": ""^0.1.0""
  },
```
### Front-End Package.JSON Requirements (In the use-case that npm install does not work when within the back-end directory)
```json

  }
```

### Running the Back-End
1. Ensure you have all the dependencies listed above installed for the back-end <i>(You may use the npm install command for this)</i>.
2. If you are running Firebase, change the config.js file to match your own Firebase enviroment and storage bucket and run ```firebase deploy ``` or ```firebase serve``` for a non deployment based enviroment.
   <br/> <b>OR</b> <br/> If you are not running the application on your Firebase Configuration, run ```npm start``` to start the index.js file within the back-end.
3. Once your Firebase or Local Enviroment is running, you may proceed to the ""Running the Front-End"" section of this README.

#### Note: 
If you do not wish to create a Firebase configuration, it is possible to the use API link provided within the App.js inside the front-end ""re-agent-dashboard"" folder within this repo.
```js
// The API URL (Allows use of shorthand axios method calls)
axios.defaults.baseURL = ""https://europe-west2-re-agent-dashboard-22410.cloudfunctions.net/api""
``` 
This line will allow you to run my back-end configuration on firebase through the front-end.

### Running the Front-End
1. Ensure you have all the dependencies listed above installed for the front-end <i>(You may use the npm install command for this)</i>.
2. CD into the directory named <b>""re-agent-dashboard""</b> (Front-End/re-agent-dashboard).
3. Run the command ```npm start``` to locally host the front-end server.
4. (Optional) You may run ```npm run build``` to create a build folder for the application and host it upon your own firebase platform,
using ```firebase deploy``` within the re-agent-dashboard folder.


### Goals and Features
The goal of the appliation is to accomodate the data management needs of agents within the Real Estate Industry by giving them a jack of all trades platform,
which hosts services such as To-do's,Notes,Calendar Events and Real Estate related data such as Listings or Open Houses.

#### Initial Goals 
At a minimum, the application should have:

1. User Login and Signup Functionality
2. The ability to create various real estate related data fields with full CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) method support.
3. A Responsive and Intuitive UI.
4. Secure Routes and Privacy concerns handled to a decent degree.

#### Main Implemented Features
* Security Through Firebase
* JWT Authenticated Tokenization and Secure Routes
* Creation of <b>Notes, To-do's, Calendar Events, Open Houses, Open House Attendees and Listings</b> with full CRUD support <i>(POST,GET,PUT,DELETE html methods)</i>.
* Responsive and Intuitive UI
* Cloud hosted through Firebase Hosting

rayandasoriya,RealEstateRuby,,https://github.com/rayandasoriya/RealEstateRuby,https://api.github.com/repos/RealEstateRuby/rayandasoriya,Web Application on Ruby On Rails for Real Estate Buying/Selling Properties. CSC517 (Object Oriented Design and Development) Semester Project.,"# RealEstate Application

<p align=""center"">
<img alt=""RealEstate Image"" src=""https://github.com/hrshagrwl/RealEstateApp/blob/master/public/nav.gif"">
</p>

The project is done using the concepts of Ruby on Rails for development. 

The purpose of this project is to design a portal for selling the properties. In the project, there are three access models: admin, realtor, and house hunter. House hunter is responsible for listing the details of the properties and replies to the inquiries of the house hunters. House hunter, on the other hand, can view the properties listed and can raise an inquiry. If they are interested in the property, then they can either contact the company directly or mark the company as interested.

We have also added the email feature with the replies to any inquiry and a Google login feature with only NC State email ids.
 
## Deployment 

We have deployed our project on **Heroku**. To view, [click here](https://whispering-coast-30139.herokuapp.com).

## Credentials

| Role | Email | Password | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | admin@realestate.com | password | Cannot be deleted |
| House Hunter | hunter@realestate.com | password | Unless deleted by someone |
| Realtor | realtor@realestate.com | password | Unless deleted by someone |


## Local Deployment

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository on your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/hrshagrwl/RealEstateApp.git
```

- Go to the directory of the project where it is cloned using terminal

```
cd Desktop/RealEstateApp
```


- Install gems
```
bundle install
```
-  Complete Database Migrations
```
rake db:migrate
```
- Add pre-configured users
```
rake db:seed
```
- Run server
```
rails server
```
Your app will run on http://localhost:3000


## Features
### Admin
  - Log in to the system
  - Create realtor and house hunter accounts
  - Create real estate companies
  - Delete real estate companies from the system
  - Delete users (realtors or house hunters) from the system
  - Delete properties from the system
  - Delete inquiries from the system
  - View the details (except password) of other users
  - View the list of real estate companies, along with detailed information
  - View the list of houses and detailed information
  - View the list of inquiries and detailed information

### Realtor
  - Can log in/sign up into the system
  - Can edit the profile
  - Choose an existing real estate company or create a new real estate company
  - Edit his/her company information
  - List a house if it belongs to a company
  - Edit house information that they have listed and cannot edit houses listed by other realtors
  - View all houses (including those listed by others)
  - Remove a house from the listing (previously created by this realtor)
  - View all the potential buyers for any house in his/her company and their profile details (except password)
  - View all inquiries from house hunters for any house in the company
  - Submit replies for all inquiries of houses in the company
  - Multiple realtors can belong to a single company
  - Each realtor can have multiple houses
  

### House Hunter
  - Can log in/sign up into the system
  - Can edit the profile
  - Search available houses using filters, such as price range, square footage range, location
  - View real estate company information
  - View house information
  - Send an inquiry for a certain house
  - Add a house to his/her interest list
  - Send an inquiry to multiple houses and delete them as well
  
### Some Interesting Cases
   - Deleting a company will delete all the related properties and will remove the company name assigned to any realtor
   - On changing the company, the realtor can no longer make changes to the old houses.
   - If a house hunter is deleted, all the existing inquiries will be deleted and also the name from the potential buyer list will be deleted
  
### Miscellaneous
   - When a realtor replies a house hunter‚Äôs inquiry, send **email** to the corresponding house hunter
   - All users can use their **Google account** with NCSU email id to log into the system
    
## Testing 

The testing module has been designed thoroughly for the users model and controller. To view the configuration of the added database module of the user, go to `test/fixtures/users.yml` file. To run the test case, follow the steps:

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## *(Este es s√≥lo un resumen del proyecto. Para ver los archivos del proyecto, pedir acceso: https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertofernandezmartinez/)*

Cliente: Empresa inmobiliaria que hace inversiones en grandes ciudades comprando inmuebles para posteriormente alquilarlos como apartamentos tur√≠sticos.

La direcci√≥n ha tomado la decisi√≥n de invertir en Madrid, y nos ha encargado analizar los datos que el l√≠der del sector AirBnb hace p√∫blicos para intentar encontrar los tipos de inmuebles que tienen mayor potencial comercial para alquier tur√≠stico.

Como entregable principal esperan la tipolog√≠a (o tipolog√≠as) de inmuebles que el equipo de valoraciones debe buscar entre las oportunidades existentes en la ciudad y los principales barrios o zonas geogr√°ficas en las que focalizarse.

Para cumplir con el objetivo aplicamos la metodolog√≠a de Discovery, t√©cnicas de Business Analytics aprendidas y t√©cnicas de anal√≠tica avanzada.

Aunque este caso concreto est√© centrado en el alquiler tur√≠stico, el mismo tipo de aproximaci√≥n se puede usar en casos que tengan un alto componente de ""ubicaci√≥n"":

- apertura y cierre de tiendas
- reducci√≥n de capacidad instalada
- expansi√≥n de franquicias
- ...

## OBJETIVO

Localizar el perfil (o perfiles) de inmuebles que maximizan el potencial comercial en el mercado del alquiler tur√≠stico y las principales zonas donde buscarlos.

## PALANCAS

Tras hablar con el equipo de valoraciones nos dicen que las palancas que tienen m√°s impacto en la rentabilidad de este tipo de inversiones son:

- Precio alquiler: cuanto m√°s se pueda cobrar por noche mayor es la rentabilidad
- Ocupaci√≥n: en general, cuantos m√°s d√≠as al a√±o se pueda alquilar un inmueble mayor es su rentabilidad
- Precio inmueble: cuanto m√°s barato se pueda adquirir la propiedad mayor es la rentabilidad

## KPIs

- Ocupaci√≥n: n√∫mero de d√≠as anuales que el inmueble se pueda alquilar
- Precio del alquiler: precio por noche en euros seg√∫n Airbnb
- Precio de un inmueble: n√∫mero de metros cuadrados * precio medio del m2 en su zona, aplicando un 25% de descuento sobre el precio oficial por la fuerza de negociaci√≥n del equipo de compras.

## ENTIDADES Y DATOS

Las entidades relevantes para nuestro objetivo y de las que podemos disponer de datos son:

- Inmuebles
- Propietarios
- Distritos

## PREGUNTAS SEMILLA

Sobre el precio del alquiler:

- Precio medio, rango de precios, precios por distritos y barrios
- Ranking de distritos y barrios por precio medio de alquiler
- Qu√© factores determinan el precio del alquiler (m√°s all√° de la localizaci√≥n)
- Relaci√≥n entre el tama√±o del inmueble y el precio por el que se puede alquilar
- C√≥mo influye la competencia (num inmuebles disponibles por barrio) sobre el precio del alquiler
- Variaci√≥n de precios por tipo de alquiler (piso completo, habitaci√≥n privada, habitaci√≥n compartida)

Sobre la ocupaci√≥n:

- Ocupaci√≥n media total, por distritos, y por barrios
- C√≥mo de probable es cada nivel de ocupaci√≥n en cada distrito
- Cual es el ranking de distritos y barrios por ocupaci√≥n
- Qu√© factores determinan el precio del alquiler (m√°s all√° de la localizaci√≥n)
- Relaci√≥n entre el tama√±o del inmueble y su grado de ocupaci√≥n
- C√≥mo influye la competencia (num inmuebles disponibles por barrio) sobre la ocupaci√≥n

Sobre el precio de compra:

- Ranking de precio por m2 por distrito
- Ranking de precio del inmueble por distrito
- Relaci√≥n entre el precio del inmueble y el precio del alquiler por distrito
- Relaci√≥n entre el precio del inmueble y la ocupaci√≥n por distrito

# Home is Where Your Heart Beats

This project is my first experience with `OOP paradigm in JavaScript.`The properties data is fetched from a `class constructor`, as well as filter options, that get updated automatically everytime we add a new property to the listing. The general concept of this exercise was to do everything programmatically, minimizing hard coding to zero. I also added an extra feature such as displaying different currency depending on the user's time zone - `new Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions()`. Feel free to dive deeper into my source code!


<b>yhome is a 'fake' brand that I designed and created for learning purposes</b>. Because I love creative tasks, creating new brand concepts right next to solving programming problems is always exciting.

It was a great experience, and I am happy to have it accomplished. Massive thanks to `unsplash.com` for amazing interior design photos!

a web image manager based on spring boot + freemarker + elfinder 2.x + jquery ui

Technologies:
1)Java Development Kit 8 ;
2)Spring Boot 1.5.22 with freemarker ;
3)Jquery-ui 1.12.1 ;
4)Elfinder  2.1.39 ;


Overview of differences and usage with servlet versions:

1.the servlet .xml file split into 2 spring-boot config files.
""ElfinderBeansConfiguration.java"": define all the beans the system needs
""ElfinderConnectorServlet.java"": the servlet used by the original program. 

2.add a file download servlet, turn url from some kind of hash code to clear text, reduce the complexity of file references.
such like from ""some-servlet/connector?cmd=file&target=images_L3Bob3RvLzE1MjUzMTM5NDg1MjkuanBn&_t=1591144312&exculsiveFolder=photo"" change to ""/another-servlet/images/photo/1525313948529.jpg"". this allows front-end developers to assemble file URLs as they did in good old times, making it easier for them to accept the module import and operation changes

3.modified the entrance to the volume configuration. we can customize all volume initialization operations above, such as reading configuration information from properties/json/database,and here we define the volume using the configuration ""VolumesProperties.java"" & ""volumes.properties"" to define volumes of the web site.

4.if a more advanced volume configuration is required, it is recommended to refer to ""StaticFsServiceFactory.java"" to customize your scenario, such as setting the right path based on user profiles

5.used an advanced elfinder webjar package to solve the problem of manual downloading of elfinder files that will be named ""connector"",these can be referred to in the ""pom.xml"".

6.don't forget to put ""mime.types"" in the resources directory *_^

Next plan:
The implementation of ""elfinder-2.x-servlet"" is straightforward, so we made this spring boot demo based on this branch.
I'm going to modify all the servlet entrances to the controller, are there partners interested in this? We can learn and solve the problems we all encounter.

**This script is already a few years old, dependencies (like XPATHs) might have changed**

Some years ago I was looking to buy my first house. It was not an easy task to find a house in Utrecht,
housing prices are going through the roof and quite some houses are already sold before the're
added on Funda. Key is being early!  

That is why I wrote this script, so I could call the real estate agent first! And with success.
Using this script I found and bought my first house.  

## Installation
This script is a stand alone script, aside from the dependencies there is no need to install the scraper.  
Dependencies:  
* selenium (3.4.0)  
* Firefox (59.02)  
* geckodriver (0.20)  
* pandas  
* telegram  

## Usage
The usage of this script is quite straightforward, but you'll need to setup Telegram first. Take a look at: https://core.telegram.org/bots/. Note the `telegram_token` and the `telegram_chat_id`.   

Next step is deciding what and which kind of house you're looking for. Go to Funda, set the location, define the filters and copy the into the `funda_url`-parameter. 

```
sf = FundaScraper(funda_url = '',
                telegram_token = '',
                telegram_chat_id = '',
)

sf.run()
```

## Counter bot-blocks
Sometimes Funda (or other site you want to scrape) find out you're using a bot and they'll block you. Here we're using two things to counter their blocks.  

### User Agent
First we're changing the user agent of your browser.
The user agent says to the site which browser and OS you're using, but we can change this. 
When getting blocked, we're changing it to another heavy used agent.  

### Proxies
The next thing we're doing is changing the actual url we're accessing the site from. https://www.sslproxies.org/ has a list of proxies, we're simply looping through the list until we've found a proxy which is accepted by Funda.

This data was originally a part of UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been removed now. We can also access this data from the scikit-learn library. The objective is to predict the value of prices of the house using the given features.,"# *Applied Machine Learning Housing- Regression*

![img0](https://miro.medium.com/max/566/1*Zm2Hu724W6UQCVWWQe7afg.jpeg)


>1.Understand the requirements of the business

We are enthusiastic data scientists and before starting we need to ask some fundamental questions

 1. Why does our organisation need this predictive model?

    * possibly we are a real-estate firm and interested in investing in California
    * the organisation will use this data to feed another machine learning model
    * current process is good but manual and time consuming
    * our organisation wants an edge over competition
    * we are a consulting firm in the real-estate business and this data is valuable

2. We need to understand what are we doing at the root level

    * We‚Äôll train our model on existing data so we are doing supervised learning
    * Since we need to predict housing prices we are doing regression
    * Output depends on many parameters so we are doing multivariate-regression

>2. Acquire the dataset
Get the dataset in CSV format here and store it in a folder. We prepare a virtual environment, activate it, install the dependencies
Start Jupyter notebook and do the basic imports
```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import os
import pandas as pdhousing = pd.read_csv('./housing.csv')
housing.head(5)
```

This data has metrics such as the ```population, median income, median housing price```, and so on for each block group in California.

```python
housing.info()

Leveraging Meraki's guest WiFi captive Wi-Fi portal to improve customer engagement and provide instant contextual feedback to property mgmt duty manager. To improve guest feedback which is often shared in social media after the guest has left the premise with vivid negative experience, telling the world via social media their negative experiecnce with damaged reputation difficult to remediate.  This simple guest survey (splash page) is to collect user feedback upon successful guest Wi-Fi login. We leverage the built-in feature of Meraki Access Point. https://documentation.meraki.com/MR/MR_Splash_Page/Splash_Page_Details_for_Meraki_MR

A google form is created to collect feedback with rating between 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good)

If the feedback score is 1, the google script on the google form will triger an email (via Google SMTP) to duty manager's email address.

A language match of the feedback's text will be used to select the appropriate MV to take a snapshot whereby the image will be included in the email to be sent to the duty manager to give more context. For example, if the feedback says ""broken glass near the exit A"", then script will send API call to Meraki MV camera near exit A to take a screenshot and the image is pasted onto the email to Duty Manager to give a visual on the area for impact to customer flow near Exist A.

This repo includes a non-technical summary presentation and jupyter notebook to get the estimates.
The notebook includes everything you'll need in a row to successfully run the notebook. However, you will need the following modules:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Statsmodels
- Sci-kit learn
- Pyramid ARIMA

**Note: The data contained in zillow_data.csv is the raw data. To preprocess the data for Atlanta you will need to filter by the _Metro_ column for _Atlanta_**

The notebook deals with predicting the real estate values for the zipcodes that encompass the Atlanta metro area and how their value changes over time using time series analysis. The data ends in 2017, so the following values are predicted here:

| Zipcode | May 2018 | October 2018 | April 2019 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Overview

I created an interactive dashboard using Toronto real estate data, including [Toronto Census Data](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/toronto_neighbourhoods_census_data.csv) and [Toronto Neighbourhood Coordinates](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/toronto_neighbourhoods_coordinates.csv), with the help of the [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/).

This dashboard's goal is to provide charts, maps, and interactive visualizations that help customers explore the data and determine if they want to invest in rental properties in Toronto.

## Rental Analysis

The code for the rental analysis is contained in [rental_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/rental_analysis.ipynb).

### Dwelling Types Per Year
This section calculates the number of dwelling types per year and visualizes the results as a bar chart using the Pandas plot function.

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/dwelling_types01.png)
![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/dwelling_types02.png)

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/dwelling_types04.png)

### Average Monthly Shelter Costs in Toronto Per Year

This section visualizes the average monthly shelter costs per year to better understand the rental income trends over time. See below the average (mean) shelter cost for owned and rented dwellings per year:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/shelter_costs.png)

### Average House Value per Year

This section determines the average house value per year. An investor may want to better understand the sales price of the rental property over time. For example, a customer will want to know if they should expect an increase or decrease in the property value over time so they can determine how long to hold the rental property.

See below the average house value in Toronto per year:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/house_value.png)

### Average House Value by Neighbourhood

This section compares the house value by neighbourhood. By using `hvplot`, the graph includes an interactive dropdown selector for the neighbourhood. See in the image below:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/value_by_neighbourhood.png)

### Number of Dwelling Types per Year

This section visualizes the number of dwelling types per year in each neighbourhood. This provides investors with a tool to understand the evolution of dwelling types over the years.

By using `hvplot`, the graph includes an interactive visualization of the average number of dwelling types per year with a dropdown selector for the neighbourhood. See in the image below

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/dt_per_year.png)

### Top 10 Most Expensive Neighbourhoods

In order to ascertain which neighbourhoods are the most expensive, I calculated the mean house value for each neighbourhood and then sorted the values to obtain the top 10 most expensive neighbourhoods on average. 

The results are plotted as a bar chart:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/10_most_expensive.png)

### Neighbourhood Map

In this final section I read in neighbourhood location data and built an interactive map with the average prices per neighbourhood. A scatter Mapbox object from Plotly express was used to create the visualization.

See the visualisation below:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/map.png)

### Cost Analysis

See below a bar chart row facet created to plot the average house values for all Toronto neighbourhoods per year:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/value_neighbourhood.png)

See below a sunburst chart to conduct a cost analysis of the most expensive neighbourhoods in Toronto per year:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/sunburst.png)

## Dashboard

The [dashboard.ipynb](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/dashboard.ipynb) notebook contains the dashboard code. 

See the dashboard below:

![](https://github.com/sarahm44/rental-analysis/blob/main/Images/dashboard.png)

## Environment

This repo utilises PyViz. It is recommended the following are installed in a new environment.

### New Environment

Create a new environment using:

```shell
conda update anaconda
conda create -n pyvizenv python=3.7 anaconda -y
conda activate pyvizenv
```

### Before You Install PyViz Dependencies

Before installing the PyViz dependencies, you need to install a couple of libraries. First, install the `python-dotenv` library using `pip` to work with environment variables.

```shell
pip install python-dotenv
```

Next, install the `nb_conda` package that will allow you to switch between virtual environments in Jupyter lab.

```shell
conda install -c anaconda nb_conda -y
```

### PyViz and its Dependencies

Follow the next steps to install PyViz and all its dependencies in your Python virtual environment.

1. Download the PyViz dependencies **nodejs** and **npm** (included in nodejs).

    ```shell
    conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=12 -y
    ```

2. Use the `conda install` command to install the following packages. Note: On some of these installs, you may get a message that says that the requested packages are already installed. That is fine. Conda is really good at installing all of the required dependencies between these tools.

    ```shell
    conda install -c pyviz holoviz -y
    conda install -c plotly plotly -y
    conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab=2.2 -y
    ```

3. Use pip to install the correct versions of `matplotlib` and `numpy` using the following commands:

  ```shell
  pip install numpy==1.19
  pip install matplotlib==3.0.3
  ```

4. PyViz installation also requires the installation of Jupyter Lab extensions. These extensions are used to render PyViz plots in Jupyter Lab. Execute the below commands to install the necessary Jupyter Lab extensions for PyViz and Plotly Express. 

    * **IMPORTANT:** _In some installation cases you may encounter the following warning. If you do, **continue with the installations as indicated**, as this warning will **not** affect your code._

      ```
      Config option `kernel_spec_manager_class` not recognized by `EnableNBExtensionApp`
      ```

    * Set `NODE_OPTIONS` to prevent ""JavaScript heap out of memory"" errors during extension installation:

      ```shell
      # (OS X/Linux)
      export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096

      # (Windows)
      set NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096
      ```

    * Install the Jupyter Lab extensions: 

      ```shell
      jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager --no-build

      jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly --no-build

      jupyter labextension install plotlywidget --no-build

      jupyter labextension install @pyviz/jupyterlab_pyviz --no-build
      ```

    * Build the extensions (This may take a few minutes):

      ```shell
      jupyter lab build
      ```
    
    * Using the `build` and `--no-build` flags allows the machine to build all four extensions simultaneously, otherwise you will have to wait several minutes in between in each installation.
        
    * After the build, unset the node options that you used above:

      ```shell
      # Unset NODE_OPTIONS environment variable
      # (OS X/Linux)
      unset NODE_OPTIONS

      # (Windows)
      set NODE_OPTIONS=
      ```

5. Run the following commands to confirm installation of all PyViz packages. Look for version numbers with at least the following versions.  

      ```shell
      conda list nodejs
      conda list holoviz
      conda list hvplot
      conda list panel
      conda list plotly
      ```

      ```text
      nodejs                    12.0.0
      holoviz                   0.11.3
      hvplot                    0.7.1
      panel                     0.10.3
      plotly                    4.14.3
      numpy                     1.19
      matplotlib                3.0.3
      ```

6. You will also need to register for a public mapbox API key, which can be obtained via [this sign-up link](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/). Detailed information on how Mapbox can be used to generate plots can be found on [Plotly's documentation page](https://plotly.com/python/scattermapbox/#mapbox-access-token-and-base-map-configuration).

Each folder contains a project that utilizes several different computer science,  financial, and statistical concepts to solve unique business problems. Below is a link to my Google Cloud that contains videos of the code I built and how some of these programs function in real-time:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DUw8DkCcvCtE4YSsbMG9Zf_vpRzjwl8w?usp=drive_link

Web Scrapping:

1. LinkedIn Applier is a script that automatically applys for jobs for a LinkedIn user. This program can apply to jobs that only require your contact infomration and resume. The limitation of this program is that it only applies for applications that do not require unique questioning.
   
2. Earnings Calendar Scrape goes the Nasdaq Earnings Calendar and filters all the companies that are releasing earnings reports after market close that day. This list is usually 50 stocks when it's ""Earnings Season"".

3. Nasdaq Historical Price retrieves the maximum daily historical prices for a given stock. This data is used for quantative stock analysis. 

Regressions/Probabilities:

1. Real Estate Project utilizes a multi-linear regression model, backed with it's assumptions to predict Tax Assessed Property Value for a certain property in the Philadelphia, PA region. The project also includes a visual, descriptive analytics section that gives the user a better understanding of how the data is distributed and premliminary analysis on what variables may be significant in predicting Tax Assessed Property Value.

2. Earnings Model Project invovles the Naive Bayes Algorithm to predicts whether or not a specific, or multiple, stock(s) will increase within the range of 1% to 5%, the trading day following date that their earnings were released. The model justifies the variables used in the analysis, and is user friendly.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):

1. Sneaker Project calculates the sentiment regarding a sneaker(s) that will be released in the near future. Understanding how the how people on Twitter feel about a certain shoe can be helpful to shoe buyers looking to resell. The project used Sentiment Analysis tools such as Co-sign Similarity, Topic-Modeling, and Python's Vader.

# Where_to_Build
In this project we **aim** to build **new health centers** at places where there is a **lack of medical services** using a **dynamic mapping** system. The ***tools*** that we have used so far are **web scraping** , **python3**(for making our base code run).Website is constructed using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Flask(_WTForms,_Bootstrap,etc.), SQLAlchemy and Sqlite(as database for login information)**. 
The **coronavirus pandemic** has shown us all in just a few days how fragile our way of life really is. Basic certainties about our health, that of our loved ones and our normal way of life can no longer be taken for granted.Opening temporary or permanent **medical centers at the right place** for now is the basic aim so that for any sort of treatment no one has to travel long distances and can be cured at nearby places itself and medical services can reach a large number of people at same time.

**CHECK ```Demo.mp4``` for quick demonstration.**

# Blockchain-Developer-Nanodegree-Udacity
Completed coursework from Udacity's Blockchain Developer Nanodegree program: https://www.udacity.com/course/blockchain-developer-nanodegree--nd1309


## Blockchain Developer
Learn the fundamentals of the blockchain platform. Create your own private blockchain, and secure a digital asset using blockchain identity. Explore the Ethereum platform, and use Solidity and smart contracts to develop your own decentralized app.


### PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE
You should be comfortable with object-oriented programming, and developing web apps in Javascript.
- 1+ years of experience with object-oriented programming
- Experience developing web applications with the Javascript language using node.js (asynchronous JavaScript code)
- Knowledge of how to build a server and use the client-server model in software architecture
- Proficiency creating and consuming data using a remote API
- Developing the front end and back end of a web application with JavaScript


![image](https://github.com/BrianHHough/Blockchain-Developer-Nanodegree-Udacity/blob/master/Documentation/Core%20README/Nanodegree-Popup.png)


## Section 1: Blockchain Fundamentals
### Learn the basics of how the blockchain data model works by creating your own private blockchain using Node.js and Leveldb.
A blockchain is a shared database that features added immutability as a safe and accurate alternative to
existing data storage methods. You‚Äôll learn the basics of how the blockchain data model works by creating
your own private blockchain using Node.js and Leveldb.

In this project, you‚Äôll learn the fundamentals of architecting a collection of data into a blockchain data model. You'll configure how each block stores data, validate blocks, add new blocks to the chain, and create
methods to validate the chain integrity.

You'll then create a back-end API web service, and migrate your private blockchain to the web service. In the
process, you'll learn how to post new blocks to the blockchain via a RESTful web client. You‚Äôll then encrypt
and decrypt the unique digital collectibles on a private blockchain.

**Key Lessons:**
- Blockchain basics
- Managing blockchain transactions
- Bitcoin Core Testnet
- Blockchain data
- Private blockchains
- Digital assets on the blockchain


## Section 2: Ethereum Smart Contracts, Tokens and Dapps
### Advance your blockchain skillset to the second generation of blockchain services with smart contracts utilizing the Ethereum network.
With Project 2, your focus moves from Bitcoin to Ethereum blockchain. You‚Äôll begin by building a
decentralized app (Dapp) that allows you to create, sell, and transfer ownership of unique star token
(CryptoStar) on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and the non-fungible (ERC721) token
standard. This service is designed to demonstrate how to claim and transfer ownership of unique digital
asset ( e.g. document, deed, agreement, media, etc.) on Ethereum blockchain.

You‚Äôll build the back-end infrastructure for the CryptoStar with a pre-developed front end. This will enable
you to render the service on any modern web clients.

**Key Lessons:**
- Ethereum fundamentals and development tools
- Smart contracts with solidity
- Ethereum Dapps


## Section 3: Blockchain Architecture
### Learn blockchain architecture and advanced concepts such as privacy, security and decentralized file management.
By the completion of Project 2, you‚Äôll have learned the importance of Proof of Existence, which is used to
verify whether a digital asset is authentic and can be trusted. In this project, you‚Äôll scale up to architect a
solution that verifies authenticity for a product when multiple actors are involved.

You‚Äôll build a supply chain system on Ethereum blockchain that allows users to verify the authenticity of an
item as it passes through different hands. You will architect a Dapp (Decentralized Application) authenticity
management system backed by the Ethereum platform. To do so, you‚Äôll scope out the needs of the various
actors in the supply chain and create smart contracts that help track product origination and verify product
authenticity. You‚Äôll then tie this all together with a simple front-end that allows users to manage the product
life-cycle as the product moves through the supply chain.

**Key Lessons:**
- Planning blockchain solutions
- Privacy
- Security & maintenance
- Distributed file system


## Section 4: Dapp with autonomous smart contracts and oracles
### Advance your blockchain skill set by developing a decentralized application (Dapp) that will perform actions based on external triggers, and handle payments.
In the real-world, many smart contracts perform actions based on external triggers. These triggers can be
caused by our actions, or by data received from outside sources using what are known as ‚Äúoracles.‚Äù To make
real-world decentralized applications, smart contracts need to respond autonomously to these triggers,
thereby making these applications more interactive.
In this project, you'll build a decentralized application for a use case in which you have airlines that offer
flight delay insurance, and passengers who carry this insurance, and who get paid in the event their flight is
delayed. You‚Äôll build multiple smart contracts which are autonomously triggered by external sources, and
which handle payments based on flight delay scenarios.

**Key Lessons:**
- Multiparty control and payments with smart contracts
- Oracles
- Handling smart contract payments


## Section 5: Capstone
### For your capstone project, you‚Äôll use all the new skills you‚Äôve acquired to build decentralized property listing application.
Here, you‚Äôll use all the new skills you‚Äôve acquired to build decentralized property listing application.

In this project, you will represent your ownership of the property using ZK-SNARKs and then mint tokens to
represent your claim to the property. You will then make these tokens available for sale on blockchain
marketplace.

**Key Lessons:**
- ZK-SNARKs
- Zokarates framework

## Features

**Color: Sale Price**<br/>
Click on multiple colors in the key to highlight the houses in the map.
- Colors are coded in increments of $200K
- The values shown in the key is the minimum value (so if it shows $1M then it means that the houses highlighted will be from $1M to $1.2M)
- Select multiple colors by holding down your mouse (or the Shift button)
- Use lasso to select houses in a particular region and update the bar chart below

**Bubble Size: Square Foot Radius - 2 Types**<br/>
Explore how big the house is relative to the lot size.
- The outer faint circle represents the lot square footage
- The inner dark circle represents the house square footage

**Bubble Tooltip**<br/>
On hover, see details about the home including bedrooms, square footage and address.
- Click on the bubble to see direct link to the house on redfin (use this to quickly navigate to the site in a new tab to look at photos and other details about the property)

**Filters: Sale Price and Date**<br/>
Narrow down the date range and the price of homes
- Filter the the date range for underlying data to view different time periods
- Update the price range
- *Tip: The markets change frequently, so looking at how the last three months performed is probably most helpful as well as a general yearly trend (summer tends to be higher priced homes, while winter has fewer homes for sale).*

**Filters: Number of Beds, Bathrooms**<br/>
- Filter homes based on how many bedrooms and/or bathrooms they have

**Bar Chart: Monthly Aggregate Sales (with Median and Average)**<br/>
- All the houses are ordered from highest to lowest each month including a Median cost as well as Average.
- Clicking on any one home will in the bar chart will highlight it on the map (click on a white space in the bar graph to remove the temporary filter and see all the homes again)

**Filter: Favorites**<br/>
If you have an account on Redfin, you can favorite houses and visualize them.
- Download file from Redfin includes a field for your favorites which can be displayed exclusively on the map
- Ability to highlight your favorites while keeping the other homes on the map



## Upload your own data

Redfin makes this pretty straightforward and all you need to do is download a csv. You can go to their support article [here](https://support.redfin.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016476931-Downloading-Data-), but it is honestly just a few clicks. Just note that they have a limit on how far in data you can go and how much you can download in one go.<br/>

[Screenshots of steps below](https://github.com/pleonova/real-estate/blob/master/UploadYourData)

1) Download CSV from Redfin.
2) Download Tableau Workbook or make a copy if you have a free Tableau Public account. You can also install a free 14-day trial (or just use a Tableau Public installation that you can only save by posting data to Tableau Public).
3) Go to **Data Source** tab at the bottom left and drag your files into the *Need more Data?* region.
4) Remove the old data source *redfin_2021_* under **Connections** on the top left.
5) Drag and drop your file(s). If more than one, hover the next one over the old one so you can do a UNION between the files.
6) Go to **#1 House Sales & Sqft/Lot Size** and update the *Sold Date* filter! Do not forget to do this, otherwise you will not see any of your data.
7) Lastly, hover over the disbtribution chart at the bottom and sort the prices.
8) Explore your own data!",0,0,1,0,real-estate,"[chart, data-visualization, heatmap, real-estate, tableau-public, visualization]",0

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### 1. Create a New Database

During the installation we need to use a MySQL database. You will need to create a new database and save the credentials for the next step.

### 2. Copy the `.env.example` file

We need to specify our Environment variables for our application. You will see a file named `.env.example`, you will need to duplicate that file and rename it to `.env`.

Then, open up the `.env` file and update your *DB_DATABASE*, *DB_USERNAME*, and *DB_PASSWORD* in the appropriate fields. You will also want to update the *APP_URL* to the URL of your application.

```bash
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=prestapp
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### 3. Add Composer Dependencies
```php
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```
### 4. Run Migrations and Seeds

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan app:demo-fresh-start
```
<br>

backend development
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Frontend development
The backend have to be running

```bash
# install npm packages
npm install
# development
npm run dev
```

üéâ And that's it! You will now be able to visit your URL and see your Atmosphere application up and running.

===

Currently we download from [TREC](https://www.trec.texas.gov/) the following [""High Value Data Sets""](https://www.trec.texas.gov/public/high-value-data-sets)

* Broker and Sales Agent License Holder Information
* Inspector License Holder Information
* Easement or Right-Of-Ways agents License Holder Information

You can find the [data and field definitions on the TREC High Value Data Sets Instructions page](https://www.trec.texas.gov/public/trec-public-information-files-instructions)

Rationale 
---

I'm looking for a broker that is independent in my area, that

1. Won't charge me a desking fee.
2. Doesn't want a percentage cut.
3. Preferably local and clever.

Thus...

	SELECT *
	FROM trec.view_all_licenses
	WHERE license_type = 'Individual Broker'
		AND license_status     = 'Current and active'
		AND mailing_county     = 'HARRIS'
		AND physical_county    = 'HARRIS'
		AND addr_mailing_city  = 'KINGWOOD'
		AND addr_physical_city = 'KINGWOOD';

And, I can go broker shopping.

Instructions
---

Inside this repo, you'll find a script called `init.sh`. Running that script should download and convert the raw data to a format for ingestion. This scripts calls `runall.sql` which handles the creation of the schema and loading the data into PostgreSQL.

Requirements
---

* PostgreSQL
* iconv (to convert from CP850 to UTF-8)
* sed to remove \x00's from the feed.
* curl to download the raw data files.

Fund work and integration

bunnysaini/propertyware

## Features
This is a simple system that will keep track of housing properties that are available for rent and sale and will serve as a connecting bridge between customers and property sellers. This method eliminates the need to visit several locations in pursuit of the desired location. This project would serve as a marketplace for home line property sellers and buyers. It will keep track of the properties, homes, or flats for sale and rental purposes, as well as their prices and amenities, along with the seller's contact details and make this information accessible to customers.

PropertyWare captures the following functions for a seller:
- Add / List Property
- Manage Dashboard
- Remove Property
- View / Modify Profile

PropertyWare captures the following functions for a buyer:
- Find properties using Search Engine
- Detailed Information of Desired Property
- View / Modify Profile
- Packers&Movers Feature

This software asks for user details at the time of creating account. The user can be a buyer or seller of a property, buyers get to see the list of properties listed so that further operations can be carried out in required manner.

## Functionality
The software uses Java Programming Language for back‚Äìend and Swing API for front-end GUI design using Eclipse IDE. Query Based Language, SQL has been used for database manipulation and MySQL Workbench as well as JDBC (Java DataBase Connector) has been used for connection. It also uses OOPs Concepts such as Abstraction, Polymorphism to work with multiple classes. Error Handling and Data Validation has been implemented at evert possible branch.

Vira-lata Caramelo √© uma aplica√ß√£o desktop que verifica periodicamente sites
de aluguel de im√≥veis de acordo com 3 par√¢metros de busca, sendo eles:

1. Custo m√°ximo do aluguel (aluguel + IPTU + seguro inc√™ndio + outros custos)
2. Quantidade de quartos
3. √Årea da cidade

![Overview do app](./app.gif)

A motiva√ß√£o para a cria√ß√£o dessa solu√ß√£o foi facilitar a minha vida em momentos que quero mudar de cidade/im√≥vel,
j√° que a pesquisa pode ser muito cansativa, logo, ter uma aplica√ß√£o que fa√ßa o trabalho de buscar e responder r√°pido
a novos im√≥veis anunciados √© de grande ajuda, principalmente para quem n√£o tem muito tempo durante o dia para ficar
pesquisando.

Outro motivo foi a demora que √© para o
[Homes](https://help.quintoandar.com.br/hc/pt-br/articles/360023947132-O-que-%C3%A9-o-Homes-) trazer novos
an√∫ncios e, em homenagem ao mascote nacional e como uma refer√™ncia ao Homes, veio o nome de Vira-lata Caramelo.

Essa aplica√ß√£o foi constru√≠da usando tecnologias/ferramentas como [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/),
[React](https://reactjs.org/) e [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

Nesse momento a busca √© feita somente para **aluguel** de im√≥veis e usando o
[Quinto Andar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br/) como provedor da busca.

‚ö† O [Quinto Andar](https://www.quintoandar.com.br/) n√£o patrocina esse projeto ~~infelizmente~~.

# Build üõ†

Para construir uma distribui√ß√£o da aplica√ß√£o, basta executar o comando `yarn package` ou o comando `yarn make`.

O primeiro gera uma vers√£o execut√°vel da aplica√ß√£o pronta para produ√ß√£o e o segundo faz a mesma coisa, por√©m j√°
empacotando-a, facilitando a distribui√ß√£o.

# Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Para rodar a aplica√ß√£o localmente pasta executar o comando `yarn start` depois de instalar os pacotes atrav√©s do
comando `yarn`, ambos os comandos sendo executados na raiz do projeto.

# TODO üìù

* Testes automatizados integrados ao CI
* Customiza√ß√£o da periodicidade da busca por novos im√≥veis
* Adi√ß√£o de novos provedores (_e.g._ Casa Mineira, Zap Im√≥veis, OLX, etc.)
* Cria√ß√£o do pipeline de _delivery_
* Adi√ß√£o de mais op√ß√µes ao filtro de busca (_e.g._ quantidade de banheiros, quantidade de garagens)
* Adi√ß√£o de busca por im√≥veis a venda
* Lista de favoritos
* Feedback visual de an√∫ncios j√° visualizados
* Lista de ignorados

This project demonstrates the creation and use of a machine learning model for predicting the expected daily rate of short term rentals in a single zip code. The daily rate prediction is valid only for the month you input as part of your query (e.g. December might have lower prices than June). The model was built with Python, SKlearn, and CSV data from the website, AllTheRooms.com. This type of model might be used often for price recommendation algorithms in websites like AirBnB.

The model has an R2 and R2 adjusted score of 70% with an RMSE of 44. That means the model is pretty good at predicting the ""right"" daily rate for a rental based on the features of the property in question.

To simply use the model, you can download the pickle file and integrate it into your code (remember it was trained for my area only and may not accurately predict prices for your area). You can also download the Jupyter notebook and modify it for your own data.

Note that I did not upload the source data. AllTheRooms.com requires a subscription to download their data and therefore the legality of uploading the source data from this project is questionable.

React JS, Material UI and Chart JS. 

## üìñ Story behind the project

When my brother was going to buy his first apartment he got frusterated about how the prices increased tremendously once the bidding process started. He found it difficult to predict what the final price would become for different types of apartments that he was interested in. His frusteration got me interested in what apartment I could buy for X SEK and which factors I should take into consideration (such as time of the year, broker etc) when buying an apartment. 

I could not find any free dataset to fetch Stockholm's real estate data from so my friend Hannes coded a [web scraper](https://github.com/hannesbrinklert/Hemnet-web-scraping) that scrapes the data from Hemnet, Sweden's largest real estate marketplace.

Blockchain: 
Hyperledger

Language Written: 
Javascript

Project Type: 
Smart-Contract

Contributors to the Smart-Contract: 
JiaMing, WeeKim (https://github.com/kim-pixel).

Project Summary: 
This a smart contract project is written and completed for IBM Blockchain Course (i.am-vitalize Cybersecurity specialization track).
My team was task to provide a blockchain solution, leveraging on finding through our Enterprise Design Thinking session.
We made the decision as a team take up the challenge to improve the liquidity of real-estate assets in Singapore, through identifying the inefficiencies in the current real-estate transfer process and highlight possible improvements through blockchain (hyperledger).
Project is written leveraging on Hyperledger fabric samples(fabcar) as reference.

Project Slide Link: 
https://www.slideshare.net/JamesNeo9/estate-exchange-realestate-blockchain-slide

Personal Learning Points: 
.Areas to Improve the Project are written within the Smart-Contract as comments.
.I underestimate my ability to read and write codes using samples as reference for the project.
.Propose blockchain solution will require broader public awareness and government support for possible adoption moving forward.
.Encounter several problems while attempting to learn identity management through hyperledger tutorials. 
.undestanding identity management will provide me with sufficient knowledge to handle money management of Buyer/Seller/Bank in the real-estate transfer process in the project.

## Introduction

This project utilizes Smart Contract technology to facilitate, validate, and enforce negotiation or performance of an agreement. This automated, self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code enables the democratization of real estate funding, rendering it more transparent, efficient, and accessible.

The Smart Contract has been designed with several features to enhance functionality and security. First, users can create a new crowdfunding campaign, specifying a goal amount to raise. Then, interested investors can contribute to the campaign while the contract keeps track of each investor's contribution and the total raised amount.

Moreover, the contract also has built-in mechanisms to safeguard the interests of both project creators and investors. For instance, if a crowdfunding campaign does not reach its funding goal by the specified deadline, the contract will automatically facilitate refunds to the investors.

This Blockchain-based Real Estate Crowdfunding solution signifies a step forward in the digital transformation of the real estate industry. It brings us one step closer to a decentralized financial landscape where anyone can participate in investment opportunities that were traditionally limited to institutions or the wealthy.

## Quick Start

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> Compile

``` sh
npm run compile
```

## Contract

This is a simple Ethereum smart contract for crowdfunding real estate projects. This contract allows users to create new crowdfunding campaigns and contribute to existing ones.

This contract includes:

- A `Campaign` struct, which is used to hold data about each crowdfunding campaign.
- A `campaigns` array, which is used to hold all `Campaign` instances.
- The `createCampaign` function, which allows a user to start a new campaign with a specific goal amount.
- The `createCampaign` function accepts a duration parameter in seconds, which is added to the current timestamp to set the deadline for the campaign.
- The `contribute` function, which allows a user to contribute to a specific campaign.
- The `checkContribution` function, which allows a user to check how much they have contributed to a specific campaign.
- The `withdrawFunds` function, which allows the campaign owner to withdraw the funds after the campaign goal has been reached.
- The `withdrawFunds` function checks whether the deadline has been reached before allowing the beneficiary to withdraw the funds.
- A `deadline` variable in the Campaign struct, which is used to set a deadline for the crowdfunding campaign.
- The `contribute` function now checks whether the campaign has ended before accepting any funds.
- A `refund` function, which allows donors to get their donations back if the fundraising goal wasn't met by the deadline. This function will check if the campaign has ended and whether the goal was met. It then verifies that the sender has contributed to the campaign, sets their contribution to zero, and then sends them back their original contribution.

*Please note, you need to make sure you have a reliable and secure way of validating and fulfilling the contracts in real life. Smart contracts are best used when complemented with a solid legal framework. Also, this is a simplified example and lacks many important features such as refunding donors if the goal isn't met, security features, dispute resolution mechanisms, etc.*

**Welcome to the Blockchain Enabled Smart Home project, where we leverage the power of blockchain technology to bring automation, security, and efficiency to your home environment.**

## Introduction

In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), where all devices are becoming smarter and interconnected, our homes are not left behind. The concept of smart homes has rapidly emerged, providing people with increased comfort, energy efficiency, and home security. However, the integration of blockchain in this domain is still relatively new and opens up a myriad of opportunities.

Our project aims to harness the benefits of blockchain, specifically Ethereum and Algorand platforms, to enhance the functionality and efficiency of a smart home. We employ smart contracts to automate home functions such as temperature control, light intensity regulation, and security alert systems based on external data inputs. These data inputs are provided by oracle services, which fetch real-world data and bring them onto the blockchain.

In our Ethereum-based implementation, we utilize the Solidity programming language to write smart contracts that interact with Chainlink oracles for fetching external data. These smart contracts are designed to react when certain thresholds, such as temperature or light intensity, are crossed, triggering corresponding actions like adjusting the temperature or light intensity, or sending a security alert.

In the Algorand version, we use PyTeal, a Python language binding for Algorand's smart contract language, TEAL. Due to Algorand's UTXO-based model and the stateful nature of its smart contracts, we construct a simplified version of a state machine to track variables such as temperature.

Although the idea of integrating blockchain technology into smart homes may seem complex, it brings forth numerous advantages, such as enhanced security, transparency, and automation. Through our project, we aim to provide a robust, decentralized, and secure smart home system that paves the way for the future of home automation.

## Quick Start

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> Compile

``` sh
npm run compile
```

## Contract

In a smart home scenario, we could imagine a smart contract that regulates and automates various functions like temperature control, light control, security etc. based on external data feeds provided by oracles. This is an oversimplified version to demonstrate the concept. In the real-world, access controls would be required for these functions to prevent anyone other than the contract owner or authorized parties from invoking these actions. Additionally, these external contract calls could fail and the smart contract should handle these failures gracefully. The oracles also need to be trusted and secure.

This example utilizes **Chainlink's Oracle** solution to retrieve external data. The three functions `checkTemperature`, `checkLightIntensity` and `checkSecurityAlert` fetches the latest data from each respective oracle feed and checks if it crosses a certain threshold. If it does, it emits an event, which can be listened to and acted upon.

For real world usage, you may want the smart contract to also have the ability to act on this information, such as by interacting with other smart contracts to automatically adjust the temperature, light intensity or alert the security company in case of a security alert.

We use three external contracts as examples: `TemperatureControlContract`, `LightControlContract` and `SecurityAlertContract`. These contracts should include the `setTemperature`, `setLightIntensity` and `setAlertStatus` methods respectively, that we could call to change the house's state.

*Note: Due to the complexity and security considerations in smart contract development, especially when oracles or any form of external data is involved, this contract should not be used as is. It's a rudimentary demonstration and actual deployment would require additional features like error handling, security precautions (like checking the source of the oracle data), efficiency optimizations, etc.*

## What it does

floorfy-dl downloads cubemap skybox 360 and equirectangular panos photos of floorfy houses virtual tours and selfconfigure vtour.json pannellum virtual tour web viewer to watch the floorfy virtual tour downloaded.  
Floorfy official viewer seems to be based in Pannellum code, same json variables names, so it's a easy thing.  

This project is a merge of https://github.com/fdd4s/floorfy-dl and https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum with light modifications over both projects.

## Dependencies

php, php-curl, curl  

This code can run over Linux and Windows  

## Usage

    $ php ./floorfy-dl.php <floorfy url>  

e.g: If the url is https://floorfy.com/tour/417174 you have to run the script this way:  

    $ php ./floorfy-dl.php https://floorfy.com/tour/417174  

It will download all the skybox and equirectangular images.  
And it will configure vtour.json to play the virtual tour with vtour.html  
Host in a webserver all skybox jpg, vtour.json, html, css, svg, png and js files to play the virtual tour, in the same folder.  
Equi jpg files are not needed to play the virtual tour in the web viewer, it can be viewed with Ricoh Theta app and Panini.  
The webserver only needs basic static configuration (no php needed to play the virtual tour).  

A live demo of this script can be seen in http://openpano.rf.gd/vtour.html

If you don't have 'pt_BR' locale installed, follow the steps:

Uncomment the line with 'pt_BR' in /etc/locale.gen
Run `sudo locale-gen && dpkg-reconfigure locales`

Now 'pt_BR' is also a valid locale.

## Local environment

First of all, you need to install poetry. To do that, run

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
```

To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (\$HOME/.poetry/bin) in your `PATH`
environment variable. Next time you log in this will be done
automatically.

To configure your current shell run `source $HOME/.poetry/env`

This project uses `black` as the code formatter and `flake8` as the linter.
To add git-hooks on your enviroment, so you can run `black` and `flake8` on your project for every commit, please execute `pre-commit install`.

Also, you need to configurate the enviroment variables accordingly. Create `env` file in the project's root folder and set the variables following the `.env.example`.

## Development

In order to have the poetry packages in a local virtual environment (in the project root directory), run:

```bash
poetry install
```

To test xpaths while building the scrapper (or changing one), you can use the http://xpather.com/.

The purpose of `runner.py` file is for debug. You can run it on your IDE as a normal python file.

## Run

To run the properties spider, execute:

```bash
scrapy runspider ./olx/spiders/properties/sell.py -a state=<lowercase_state_initials>
```

<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
During the Factom Blockchain Hackatho in Chicago, we made a model to tokenize office space. Instead of expansive and insecure Agents selling office space we have build an smart contracts with embedded KYC and whitelist that will enable a more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have it's own ERC20 token and then each floor will have its own ERC721 to separate ownership, better control of open space and easy budget management.

On top of all this we integrated an identity chain that will verify all data from the landlords and tenants and will make it reusable on multiple chains in the future. The identity data will be checked on multiple sources and can be verified on multiple places on chain and off chain.

Abstract

Real estate is the largest asset class in the world. Commercial enterprises and real estate professionals are recognizing the transformative impact of blockchain technology to optimize retail and commercial property sales, streamline payments, and increase access to real estate funds and investment opportunities.


 
 

Introduction to the Sahara Platform

Sahara's goal is to provide a blockchain based software platform for real estate transactions that anyone can access and use easily and safely.  We hope that this platform can bring value to our clients via enhancing the control and transparency to the clients.

The Foundation is located in the Republic of Malta, USA-based Sahara Street is responsible for global team operations and marketing, and Korea-based Sahara Street is responsible for technology development.

How blockchain technology is changing the real estate industry


Concept

Sahara decentralized real estate platform revenue through value through sharing and segmentation.

Sahara Real Estate Platform Concept

As assets become digital, the value of real estate will also change significantly. Traditional real estate ownership was mostly single-person ownership. The Sahara Real Estate Platform is designed to generate more revenue through sharing and segmentation capabilities.

The platform ensures transactions through secure authentication when all ownership of digitized assets and contracts is transacted through the smart contract process.

The concept of real estate sharing means that many people own equity assets.
The concept of sharing means getting rewarded when more people engage through social networks.

A segmentation node is defined as an AG (Agency) on the Sahara platform.

Value dissemination marketing through Real Estate License Brokers (AGs) operating in the Americas, Europe and Asia offers many members the opportunity to participate. It aims to be the Amazon of digital asset platform.

The current real estate valuation method (price) will go beyond our thinking in the future, and real estate prices will be created in a new way through the Sahara platform.


Sahara Platform Core Theory Overview

In the face of the digital economy, it seems that assets can be invested in real estate.  Many investors are showing a lot of interest in the price of real estate in the future.

 In the digital economy, the price of real estate will affect the real estate market such as housing due to various variables.

 Among them, the key is to select representative predictable variables and examine which variables affect the real estate price and how much.

The Sahara platform is to establish a model for determining real estate prices empirically.

  In order to predict the future real estate market such as housing through the Sahara platform, the simulation of the independent variable index will precede.

Effect of Variables

In the traditional real estate market, the price of a Real Estate Value (Vt) usually is based on standard variables as follows:
‚Ä¢   L: Land Value
‚Ä¢   B: Building and Apparatus Value
‚Ä¢   R: Revenue Producing Value such as Lease and Use Value
Therefore, the Real Estate Value in the traditional market can be expressed in the following equation: 

Vt = L+B+R

However, the Real Estate Value in the digital market (Vd) will be influenced by additional factors in comparison to the traditional Real Estate Value (Vt).
One must consider the following additional factors:

‚Ä¢   N: N represents the contribution of the total number of Real Estate Brokers/Agents (N). In Sahara Street‚Äôs case, we shall call it ‚ÄúSahara Node‚Äù represented by ‚ÄúN‚Äù in the below equation.

‚Ä¢   F: F is an important factor, which represents the value that will be brought by ‚ÄúFollowers‚Äù of the Brokers/Agents, meaning their customers and collaborators. This F shall be called ‚ÄúNode Follower‚Äù, and this number reflects the market demand that can affect the value, meaning the higher demand leads to a higher overall value, Vd.  In addition, the Node Follower will also be rewarded based on their contribution in the process, which gives them incentives for higher motivation.

‚Ä¢   I: I depict the value introduced by Investment in the digital market

‚Ä¢   X: X is a variable that affects the above-referenced factors based on market conditions, including the location of the property and the average condition of the digital market. X is introduced, in order to adequately reflect the market fluctuation of the digital market as well as the value-added by ‚Äúsharing‚Äù and ‚Äúdigitalized asset‚Äù in the digital market.


Value Prediction

Therefore, one can express the process of predicting the value of a real estate property in the digital market in the following manner:
Vd = Vt + (N*F*I)*X


In comparison between the traditional real estate and digital market, if a real estate property is digitalized, then it is obvious that the digitalized asset shall have the additional path to incorporate the market demand and interest, which explain in ‚ÄúN‚Äù, ‚ÄúF‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù in the above mathematical expression.      



 How to get to digital assets

CREATING VALUE THROUGH DATA

The sharing economy ecosystem of digital assets and technical challenges for segmentation

‚ë†Smart contracts
Smart real estate contracts enabled by blockchain will not only speed up the leasing process and save on costs, but it can also improve due diligence. Blockchain would have the ability to verify identities and incomes, and reduce the likelihood of fraud.

‚ë°Transactions

The entire real estate transaction process can be held on the blockchain. The submission of an offer, verification of title, the acceptance and verification of that offer, the due diligence process, the financing, and closing can all be verified and codified within a digital ledger. The use of blockchain for real estate transactions has significant implications for real estate agent and broker jobs.

‚ë¢Financing

Credit checks, income and identity verification, debt to income ratios, and so much more can be held on and verified using blockchain. The mortgage financing process is fraught with friction and frustration. If all your critical documents are held on blockchain, no longer do you need to scramble to get dozens of different documents to your bank or broker.

‚ë£Land titles

Traditionally kept offline, blockchain tech has the ability to store and verify these critical legal real estate documents. Imagine if you could log into a blockchain land registry to verify title ownership of any plot of land in your area.

‚ë§Leasing

Identity verification and contracting signing can be facilitated and held on a blockchain. Whether it‚Äôs income verification of the tenant, employer checks, or other references, this can all be facilitated and held on a digital ledger.

‚ë•Liquidity

If an asset becomes tokenized to 1,000 investors instead of 10, you automatically increase the liquidity of that real estate investment. If buyers and sellers of tokens are more easily able to sell and buy shares in a particular asset, then exit strategies and liquidity problems drop significantly.

‚ë¶Ownership

A real estate blockchain can be used as a single source of truth to verify ownership of assets. This includes fractional ownership through a token, and all the owners of those tokens will be publicly available.

Platforms and Marketplaces Description

Platform and Market Description

  1. Platform and Market

  Real estate technology has traditionally been primarily concerned with listing and connecting buyers and sellers.  However, blockchain introduces new methods to real estate transactions and enables trading platforms and online marketplaces to support real estate transactions more comprehensively.  For example, Sahara is developing a platform that uses blockchain technology to facilitate real estate transactions.  By tokenizing real estate, assets can be traded online on exchanges.
  The Sahara platform allows sellers to tokenize their assets and use the platform to liquidate their assets through token sales.  The collected tokens can be exchanged for fiat currency through the platform by sellers and buyers who own the assets.

 
[Diagram -B]
<The source   https://github.com/NorbanDev/RealEstate2.0>

2. No Intermediaries

Brokers, lawyers, and banks have long been part of the real estate ecosystem. However, blockchain may soon usher in a shift in their roles and participation in real estate transactions, according to a report by Deloitte.1 New platforms can eventually assume functions such as listings, payments, and legal documentation. Cutting out the intermediaries will result in buyers and sellers getting more out of their money as they save on commissions and fees charged by these intermediaries. This also makes the process much quicker as the back-and-forth between these middlemen gets cut.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
Blockchain technology has impacted the real estate industry in a variety of ways, including offering a new means for buyers and sellers to connect with one another.
Blockchain could be used to cut intermediaries out of the real estate transaction process, thereby reducing costs.
This technology could also help to codify the practice of fractional ownership of real estate.


3. Liquidity

Real estate has long been considered an illiquid asset since it takes time for sales to conclude. This isn‚Äôt the case with cryptocurrencies and tokens since they can, in theory, be readily traded for fiat currencies through exchanges. However, as tokens, real estate can be readily traded. A seller doesn‚Äôt have to wait for a buyer who can afford the whole property in order to get some value out of their property.


 
[Diagram -C]

4. Fractional Ownership

By allowing fractional ownership, blockchain also lowers the barriers to real estate investing. Typically, investments would require significant money upfront in order to acquire property. Alternatively, investors could also pool their money to acquire bigger ticket properties. Through blockchain, investors would simply have to access a trading app to buy and sell even fractions of tokens as they see fit. In addition, fractional ownership would also help them avoid managing the properties themselves such as maintenance and leasing.

Upkeep alone can add up to significant costs and dealing with tenants may be a troublesome effort. This also affects related activities such as lending where property owners often have to put their properties as collateral for loans in order to get quick access to cash. Depending on the terms, property owners may also continue enjoying use of their property.

5. Decentralization 

Blockchain commands trust and security as a decentralized technology. Information stored in the blockchain is accessible to all peers on the network, making data transparent and immutable. One only has to go back to the housing bubble crash in 2008 to see how greed and the lack of transparency in the part of institutions can have catastrophic consequences. A decentralized exchange has trust built into the system. Since information can be verifiable to peers, buyers and sellers can have more confidence in conducting transactions. Fraud attempts would also be lessened. Smart contracts are increasingly becoming admissible records with Vermont and Arizona passing such legislation. As such, smart contracts would have more enforceability beyond the technology itself.



 
[Diagram -D]

6. Costs 

The transparency associated with a decentralized network can also trim down costs associated with real estate transactions. Beyond the savings made by cutting out intermediaries‚Äô professional fees and commissions, there are other costs such as inspections costs, registration fees, loan fees, and taxes associated with real estate. These costs even vary depending on the territory that has jurisdiction. Like intermediaries, these can be reduced or even eliminated from the equation as platforms automate these processes and make them part of the system.

Global real estate is worth hundreds of trillions of dollars, but is dominated by the wealthy and large corporations. Through blockchain technology, it is possible that more people will be able to access the market where transactions can be made more transparent, secure, and equitable. Real estate transactions may eventually become truly peer-to-peer activities with blockchain-powered platforms doing most of the work.



Fractional and frictionless real estate investing
OWNERSHIP REINVENTED
For the first time, investors around the globe can buy into the Dubai  real estate market through fully-compliant, fractional, tokenized ownership. Powered by blockchain.
KYC/AML
In order for the sale of SaharaTokens to be compliant with applicable regulations, purchasing a SaharaToken through the Sahara website will require the implementation of ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù(KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) procedures. Sahara is implementing KYC procedures to verify the identities of our SaharaToken purchasers and AML procedures to ensure that payments for
SaharaTokens do not come from illegal sources. Sahara is implementing AML/KYC solutions through IdentityMind, an independent third-party solutions provider.

Sahara Site Map
 
Token Economics
SAHARA Token is a governance token that aligns incentives across all stakeholders including users, SAHARA Token  token holders, non-profit beneficiaries, the core team, advisors and partners. Below is the distribution of the SAHARA token:

SAHARA  Ecosystem refers to the total amount of tokens reserved for , incentives and grants. These incentives and grants are specifically for users of SAHARA' DeFi products, and those who make valuable contributions to the protocol.
 
Early Contributors refers to supporters who funded development and operations to build out SAHARA
Team refers to core contributors.

Partners/Advisors refers to organizations and individuals who help SAHARA develop and evangelize the product and vision.

Foundation refers to the organization committed to bootstrapping the development of the SAHARA smart contracts, driving decentralization, onboarding non-profit beneficiaries, and ensuring the values of the SAHARA Foundation charter are upheld by all beneficiaries.

Airdrop refers to SAHARA   token transfers for further decentralizing and rewarding the SAHARA community.
 

How does SAHARA perform on Ecosystem?
A new Real Estate and Gold asset class

Investors around the world are trending towards allocating significant capital towards investments that are socially conscious, sustainable, and responsible. SAHARA has not been created to serve those people, but a protocol and culture have emerged that puts people, the environment, and social responsibility first.  

Environment:
A portion of SAHARA's fees is directed towards tackling global environmental challenges via smart contracts. In this way, environmental responsibility is encoded into the heart of the protocol.

Social:
SAHARA values diversity, inclusion, and decentralized decision-making. SAHARA contributors are women and men from diverse backgrounds, from all major continents, religious backgrounds, and ethnicities. Not only does the SAHARA culture support these values internally, but through the decentralized beneficiary governance and funding mechanism of the protocol, it ensures that underrepresented and disadvantaged groups have increased access to opportunity through the power of DeFi.
Governance:
The SAHARA governance model is decentralized and is not majority controlled by any one person. It is consistent with a fair and democratic decision-making process and the forthcoming charter outlines the values and inclusive decision-making framework for the protocol and organization.

Conclusion
While the initial token mechanics for the SAHARA  token might be subject to change, the SAHARA team could not be anymore excited to roll out a tokenomic model that aligns incentives, promotes decentralization, helps automates key smart contract operations and works to inspire and ignite positive global impact through DeFi.

## Diagrams

We use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) in our repositories for simple data and process visualisations. Some examples:

### Flowchart

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    Light:::class_light --> Neutral:::class_neutral --> Dark:::class_dark
    classDef class_light fill:#FFFFFF,color:#041B26,stroke:#041B26,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef class_neutral fill:#E1E4E5,color:#041B26,stroke:#041B26,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef class_dark fill:#041B26,color:#FFFFFF,stroke:#041B26,stroke-width:2px;
```

`class_light`

``` md
classDef class_light fill:#FFFFFF,color:#041B26,stroke:#041B26,stroke-width:2px;
```

`class_neutral`

``` md
classDef class_neutral fill:#E1E4E5,color:#041B26,stroke:#041B26,stroke-width:2px;
```

`class_dark`

``` md
classDef class_dark fill:#041B26,color:#FFFFFF,stroke:#041B26,stroke-width:2px;
```

### Pie chart

``` mermaid
%%{init: {""theme"": ""base"", ""pie"": {""textPosition"": 0.5}, ""themeVariables"": { ""pieOuterStrokeWidth"": ""2px"", ""pie1"": ""#FFFFFF"", ""pie2"": ""#E1E4E5"", ""pie3"": ""#041B26""}}}%%
pie title Crypto
    ""Bitcoin"" : 386
    ""Ethereum"" : 85

**The `CommunityLandTrust` smart contract facilitates the management and operations of land parcels within a decentralized land trust community. It allows users to buy and sell land parcels, transfer ownership, and provides an administrative interface for trustees and the contract owner.**

## Introduction

In this community land trust smart contract, we explore a sophisticated example of land management on the Ethereum blockchain. The CLT contract encapsulates multiple unique aspects of a trust, including land as unique parcels rather than indistinguishable units, trustees who have special privileges, dynamic pricing, and operations like land purchase, sale, and transfer among users.

The Community Land Trust contract models the sale and purchase of land as transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of treating land as indistinguishable units, the contract recognizes each land parcel as a unique entity, with an ID and an owner. This allows for more realistic representation and tracking of land ownership.

The contract recognizes the role of trustees in a land trust. Trustees have the power to change the price of land parcels. The owner of the contract, usually the trust, has the power to add or remove trustees. All these operations trigger events that provide transparency and traceability.

Users can buy available land parcels from the trust. When a land parcel is purchased, it is assigned to the buyer and can no longer be bought by others. Owners of land parcels have the flexibility to sell the parcels back to the trust or transfer ownership to other users. This allows for dynamic changes in the distribution of land ownership within the community land trust.

While this contract offers a robust and realistic representation of a community land trust, it serves as a starting point and should be customized according to the specific needs of the trust. As with any blockchain contract, it is critical to thoroughly test and audit the contract code before deploying it on the mainnet.

In summary, the Community Land Trust contract provides a sophisticated example of using Ethereum for managing real-world assets and transactions, demonstrating the immense potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing how we handle and exchange value.

## Features

- **Purchase Land**: Users can purchase available land parcels by sending the specified Ether amount.
- **Sell Land**: Landowners can sell their parcels back to the trust.
- **Transfer Ownership**: Landowners can transfer their land parcels to another Ethereum address.
- **Admin Functions**: The contract owner and trustees have special permissions:
  - Set the price of land parcels.
  - Add or remove trustees.
  - Withdraw contract balance.

### Functions

This contract includes:

- `LandParcel`: A struct that represents a unique land parcel with an ID and owner.
- `landParcels`: A mapping from a land parcel ID to the LandParcel struct.
- `landOwners`: A mapping from an address to an array of land parcel IDs owned by that address.
- `purchaseLand`: A function for buying land parcels from the trust.
- `sellLand`: A function for selling land parcels back to the trust.
- `transferLand`: A function for transferring ownership of a land parcel to another user.
- `getLandParcels`: A function that returns all land parcel IDs owned by a user.

**This repository contains a smart contract for a Digital Twin of a building, which fetches real-time data using Chainlink Oracles. This data includes temperature, humidity, occupancy, energy consumption, structural health, water consumption, and air quality. Additionally, the contract allows for the logging of maintenance reports.**

## Introduction

This Building Digital Twin Smart Contract creates a digital representation of a physical building. The digital twin concept is an important aspect of modern construction and building management as it allows for real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and simulations of different scenarios.

This smart contract utilizes Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network, to securely retrieve and write real-world data onto the blockchain. The parameters fetched include environmental aspects such as temperature and humidity, occupancy levels, energy and water consumption levels, and air quality data. It also considers the structural health of the building, providing a comprehensive digital overview of the physical building's state.

Moreover, the contract allows the owner to log maintenance reports, thereby enabling an integrated overview of not just the physical parameters but also the maintenance and repair history.

With the use of modifiers, this contract ensures that only the owner of the contract can update the parameters and add maintenance reports, providing a robust access control mechanism.

This contract is an example of the versatility and potential of Ethereum smart contracts, and how they can interface with real-world data via oracles. By using this, building owners, management, and residents could have a clearer picture of the building's condition, maintenance needs, and usage patterns in real-time.

## Quick Start

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> Compile

``` sh
npm run compile
```

## Features

- **Real-time Building Data**: Use Chainlink Oracles to fetch and update building parameters.
- **Maintenance Reports**: Log and retrieve maintenance activities and timestamps.
- **Owner Only Actions**: Restricted access functions for the building owner to maintain control over data and settings.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Ethereum Wallet](https://metamask.io/): For interacting with the deployed contract.
- [Chainlink Node](https://docs.chain.link/docs/running-a-chainlink-node): If you want to run your own oracle.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

```bash
cd path-to-folder
```

3. Install dependencies:

davidtstill,Fundrise_Analysis,,https://github.com/davidtstill/Fundrise_Analysis,https://api.github.com/repos/Fundrise_Analysis/davidtstill,Analysis of the real estate crowdfunding platform Fundrise,"# Fundrise: Bringing Real Estate Investing to the Mainstream

## Overiew and Origin

* Company Name-Fundrise

* Year of Incorporation-Founded in 2010 and launched in 2012

* Founders-Dan Miller and Ben Miller

* Origin of the Company-Dan and Ben both worked in commerical real estate in Washington D.C. They came up with the idea to allow local residents to invest in D.C. area real estate that the brothers were developing. Dan and Ben raised $325,000 from 175 investors to invest in their first project. Fundrise was subsequently contacted by real estate companies looking to raise capital on their platform. Dan and Ben expanded upon the platform and began raising capital from investors across the United States. Fundrise became the first company to successfully crowdfund money for real estate.     

* Funding History-According to Crunchbase, Fundrise has raised a total of $55.5 million across 7 different funding rounds. 


  ![Fundrise logo](https://learnbonds.com/wp-content/images/2020/01/fundrise-300x219-1.png ""Fundrise Logo"")


## Business Activities:

* Financial Problem Being Solved-Investing in commerical real estate historically has only been accessible to institutional or accredited investors. Accredited investors must have an annual income of $200,000 for two consecutive years or a net worth exceeding $1 million. This portion of the population comprises less than 10% of total investors. This is unfair to individual investors who could  benefit by gaining access to this to a valuable asset class that has outperformed the stock market:

  ![Stocks Vs. Real Estate](https://d9hhrg4mnvzow.cloudfront.net/join.crowdstreet.com/download-ebook/yejleg-graph_0en08w0en08w000000001.png ""Stocks Vs. Real Estate 1999-2018"")

  Not only has commerical real estate performed well over the years, but it also provides valuable diverisfication benefits, has a low correlation with with the stock market, and typically provides higher yields. Real estate also happens to be the world's largest asset class worth estimated $228 trillion. Individual investors are not being given the same access to both the largest and one of the best performing assset classes. Unsurpisingly, as a result, individual investors are underweight this alternative investment class. Fundrise proposes to change the average investor's portfolio allocation, which typically consists of stocks and bonds only:

  ![Fundrise portfolio model](https://fundrise-cms.s3.amazonaws.com/fundrise-cms-1503596832.png ""The Old Way Vs. The Fundrise Way"")
Fundrise allows for individual investors to invest as little as $500 in high quality commerical real estate. Fundrise does all the work; they source the deals, perform the necessary due dilligence, and partner with local operators to develop the properties. After determining the investor's risk preference, Fundrise deploys the money into a diverse portfolio of real estate projects. The vertically integrated platform also charges lower fees by cutting out brokers and thid parties. 

* Intended Customer/Market Size/Competitive Advantage-Fundrise is able to raise money from both accredited and non-accredited investors. Fundrise markets itself as a simple way to diversify one's porfolio and gain exposure to an important asset class. It leverages technology to drive costs down and automatically puts all investors in a diversified portfolio of properties. While investors can invest as little as $500, the average investment on the platform is $5,000. This would likely indicate that most of folks investing on the platform are retail investors. 
  
  The market size is arguably quite large. Any U.S. resident over the age of 18 can invest. While it is probably unrealstic that retail investors portfolios will ever mimic the complex strategies employed by large insitutions, retail investors have trillions invested in investable assets. Fundrise does not require a huge fundamental shift in asset allocations to be successful. Fundrise also offers support for essentially every account type except via a 401(k):

  1. Individual account
  2. Joint account
  3. Entity account
  4. Trust account
  5. IRA
  
    Fundrise has a number of competitors in the crowdfunding real estate field. Some of these companies competitors include Crowdstreet, Realty Mogul, Peerstreet, AcreTrader etc. Fundrise has a few advantages over these competitors. First and perhaps most importantly, Fundrise does not require accredited investors to invest on their platform. Secondly, investors are offered a diversified portfolio of properties (in a vehicle Fundrise calls an eReit). Third, quarterly redemptions are available, eamngng this is more liquid than a traditional alternative investment. Lastly, Fundrise has a longer and more successful track record:

    ![Fundrise performance](https://www.investingsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screen-Shot-2020-03-01-at-8.30.44-PM-768x366.png ""Fundrise Historical Performance"")

* Technologies Being Used-Fundrise claims that it has designed a ""full-stack financial integration"". Specifically, the company has developed a proprietary cloud-based software with a team of securities, programming and finance professionals, which enables vertically integrated transactions. According to Fundrise, this helps to explain why its fees are lower than than the (publicly traded) products that were launched in the last few years by their much large and better funded competitors-Blackstone and Starwood. The additional reason for the lower costs is due to charging the developers for origination fees rather than investors:

## Landscape:

* Financial Industry Domain-Fundrise is in the lending/crowfunding domain of the fintech world. 

* Major Trends and Innovations-Crowdfunding generated $17.2 billion in North America in 2019. This was an increase of almost 34% YoY. The capital committed to real estate development in the crowdfunding sector has outgrown other industries in this space. The outperformance is likely due to the strong appeal from both developers and investors:

  ![Real Estate vs Other Industries](https://justcoded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/investment-crowdfunding-industry-report.png ""Real Estate Outpacing Other Industries"")

* Other Major Companies in the Domain-There are several competitors in the real estate crowdfunding space. Example include CrowdStreet, PeerStreet, EquityMultiple, RealtyMogul, RealCrowd etc. Generally the 3 biggest differences between Fundrise and other real estate crowdfunding platforms are as follows: 
  
  1. Lower minimum investment threshold  
  2. Only able to invest in a porfolio of properties
  3. Not required to be an accredited investor

## Results:

* Business Impact-In 2019, over 100,000 investors participated in real estate crowdfunding syndications, with an average size ofering of $2.3 million. The average preferred return was anywhere between 5-10%. The returns earned by these investors may not have been possible without the real estate crowfunding platforms. Not only does this help individuals to gain wealth, but the platforms also help to create more efficiency in the market. As technology disrupts the industry and more people are able to invest in real estate, this will create more transparency in an industry typically categorized by a select few (i.e. brokers).

* Core Metrics- As of December 31, 2018, Fundrise had originated ~$660 million in both equity and debt investments. This was deployed across ~$3.2 of real estate property. The company had $488 million in AUM and over 60,000 active investors. AUM and active investors increased 94% and 153% respectively YoY. This business continues to thrive as one of the first companies in the real estate crowdfunding space:

  ![Fundrise company metrics](https://www.financialsamurai.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fundrise-AUM-investor-employees-growth-728x221.png ""Fundrise Company Metrics"")

* Performance Relative to Competition-Fundrise was selected for the Forbes Fintech 50 list in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019. Interestingly, compared to the other real estate focused companies on Forbes list, Fundrise had the least amount of funding. As an example, one of the other real estate companies on Forbes list, Cadre, has received funding from legendary VC firm Andreessen Horowitz and was valued at $800 million. Cadre also boats about hiring people from top tier firms such as Apple, Goldman Sachs and Blackstone. Other notable firms on the Forbes list include companies like Acorns, Robinhood and Coibase. It is quite telling that Fundrise made this list.  

## Recommendations:

* Advice to Fundrise-Fundrise has a solid track record and good name recognition as one of the first movers in the real estate crowdfunding space. They are recognized in the industry and have over 60,000 investors. With that said, 60,000 investors is a very small percentage of the total retail investors in the U.S.. I think it would make sense for Fundrise to partner with a large brokerage firm like Fidelity or Schwab. The case for investing in real estate is compelling; real estate should be a cornerstone of investors portfolios. 

* How Partnering Would Benefit Fundrise-Fundrise needs assets to invest. Large brokerage firms like Schwab and Fidelity have trillions in assets and they are constantly trying to innovate as they compete with new Fintech startups such as Acorns and Robinhood. If a large brokerage could explain to their millions of retail investors on how real estate can benefit one's portfolio, and without having to build their own platform, it would be a win-win for both companies. 

* Additional Technologies Needed-Some integration would be required so that retail investors could see their stock and real estate portfolios on the same platform. There are a number of investment tracking apps that could potentially be utilized such as Personal Capital, SigFig Portfolio Tracker, and Mint.com. Perhaps Fundrise and their brokerage partner might encourage their client to use one of the websites to manage all their entire portfolios. 

 * Whether Technologies are Appropiate-If Fundrise and their partner brokerage firm could not integrate their platforms, then there might be privacy or cyber security concerns if all their clients link their data to a third party website. Investors may be less likely to invest in Fundrise if they cannot obtain a holistic view of their portfolio.

================================

*OpenEstate-Tool-HelloWorld* is an addon for the freeware real estate software [*OpenEstate-ImmoTool*](https://openestate.org), that does not provide any features for end users. Instead this addon

-   provides a build environment, that can easily be adapted by developers for their custom addons.
-   illustrates how to extend main menu and sidebar.

into a *CMS made simple* based website.


Description
-----------

### English

OpenEstate.org provides a freeware software - called *OpenEstate-ImmoTool* -
for small and medium sized real-estate-agencies all over the world.

As one certain feature of this software, the managed properties can be exported
to any website that supports PHP. Together with this module, the exported
properties can be easily integrated into a *CMS made simple* based website without
any frames.

#### How to configure the module?

1.  Execute a PHP-export from [OpenEstate-ImmoTool](http://en.openestate.org/immotool/)
    to your webspace, where *CMS made simple* is installed.
2.  Log in to administration of *CMS made simple* and open
    `Extensions` ‚Üí `OpenEstate PHP-Wrapper` ‚Üí `Module Preferences`. Enter path
    and URL, that points to the folder with the exported scripts.
3.  The `Integration` tab shows, if the correct script path is configured.

#### How to use the module?

1.  The module can be placed in any page or template with the smarty tag
    `{OpenEstatePhpWrapper}`.
2.  The wrapping can be configured with certain parameters. Log in to
    administration of *CMS made simple* and open
    `Extensions` ‚Üí `OpenEstate PHP-Wrapper` ‚Üí `Integration`. There you can find
    a form, to generate parameterized smarty tags.

### Deutsch

Im Rahmen des OpenEstate-Projektes wird unter Anderem eine kostenlose
Immobiliensoftware unter dem Namen *OpenEstate-ImmoTool* entwickelt. Gemeinsam
mit den Anwendern soll eine Softwarel√∂sung f√ºr kleine bis mittelgro√üe
Immobilienunternehmen entwickelt werden.

Unter Anderem k√∂nnen die im *OpenEstate-ImmoTool* verwalteten Immobilien als
PHP-Skripte auf die eigene Webseite exportiert werden. Mit Hilfe dieses Moduls
kann dieser PHP-Export unkompliziert in eine auf *CMS made simple* basierende
Webseite integriert werden.

#### Wie konfiguriere ich das Modul?

1.  F√ºhren Sie einen PHP-Export aus [OpenEstate-ImmoTool](http://de.openestate.org/immotool/)
    auf Ihren Webspace durch, wo auch *CMS made simple* installiert wurde.
2.  Melden Sie sich in der Administration von *CMS made simple* an und klicken
    Sie auf `Erweiterungen` ‚Üí `OpenEstate PHP-Wrapper` ‚Üí `Modul Einstellungen`.
    Tragen Sie Pfad und URL ein, die auf den Ordner mit den exportierten
    PHP-Skripten verweisen.
3.  Im Reiter `Integration` wird gepr√ºft und dargestellt, ob der hinterlegte
    Skript-Pfad korrekt ist.

#### Wie verwende ich das Modul?

1.  Allgemein kann das Modul durch das Smarty-Tag `{OpenEstatePhpWrapper}` in
    eine beliebige Seite (oder Template) eingef√ºgt werden.
2.  Die Einbindung kann durch weitere Parameter konfiguriert werden. Melden Sie
    sich in der Administration von *CMS made simple* an und klicken Sie auf
    `Erweiterungen` ‚Üí `OpenEstate PHP-Wrapper` ‚Üí `Integration`. Dort finden Sie
    ein Formular, mit dessen Hilfe ein Smarty-Tag inkl. Parameter erzeugt werden
    kann.

etewiah,quasar-singlepropertypages,,https://github.com/etewiah/quasar-singlepropertypages,https://api.github.com/repos/quasar-singlepropertypages/etewiah,A nifty tool to create single property pages from existing listings.  Just enter the url of a listing and it will create a page based off that.,"# SinglePropertyPages

SinglePropertyPages allows you to enter the url of a property listing and create an editable copy that you can publish as a standalone page.

It is built on the amazing [Quasar toolkit](https://quasar.dev/) and uses Vue.js.


## June 2023 update!

I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting. Would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

[https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)


## Motivation

I started work on this idea over a year ago when I was frustrated with the way a flat I wanted to sell in the UK was being presented.  Regular real estate listings websites almost always have to same template for every property.  The way a property is displayed takes no account of it's particular characteristics.

For me this was frustrating and as I aready built real estate websites for a living I decided to make a product that allows anyone to take a regular property listing and turn it into a single page that presents the property in the best light.

Long story short, I failed to monetize it adequately so rather than letting the idea die completely I decided to create a bare-bones version which I could open source.  Perhaps someone can do a better job of monetizing it than I can.

You can read a bit more about my initial project on this hn thread: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24339608](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24339608)

## üßê About <a name = ""about""></a>

Homelun CMS is a powerful real state CMS , offering a robust role-based system that includes three types of users: super admin, admin, and agent. Each role has its specific responsibilities and capabilities, ensuring smooth and efficient management of the platform.

The super admin has full control over the platform and can create new users with admin or agent roles. Admins have the ability to manage and approve properties added by agents, while agents can add property listings and handle property tour requests, among other tasks. This hierarchical structure allows for clear delegation of tasks and efficient management of property listings, making Homelun an ideal choice for real estate professionals looking for a comprehensive solution to manage their websites.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = ""getting_started""></a>

To get started with Homelun CMS, you'll need to set up the server and client environments. First, navigate to the server folder in your project directory and create an .env file. Use the provided env.example file as a reference to fill in the required information. Once your .env file is set up, you can install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```
npm install
or
yarn install
```

After setting up the server, move on to the client folder and repeat the process. Create an .env file using the env.example as a guide, and then install the required dependencies like previous way.

then run both separately with

```
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
```

## üë• Users <a name=""users""></a>

You can log in to the agent's account to test the CMS.

====================================

This repository contains the development files for the *OpenEstate-ImmoTool* users manual in English and German language. These files are used in order to generate the manual in different target formats.

-   A **HTML5 website** is generated with [*Hugo*](https://gohugo.io/).
-   A **PDF** / **EPUB** / **ODT** / **DOCX** / **XHTML (single page)** file is generated with [*Pandoc*](https://pandoc.org/).


Documentation
-------------


### How to generate the HTML5 website

In order to generate the HTML5 website you need to download [*Hugo*](https://gohugo.io/) beforehand:

-   *Linux* users may execute the script [`apps/init-hugo.sh`](apps/init-hugo.sh) in order to download *Hugo* automatically. Alternatively you can [download](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) *Hugo* manually and place its binary into the `apps/linux/bin` folder.
-   *Windows* users need to [download](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) `hugo.exe` manually and place it into the `apps/windows/bin` folder.

Afterwards you can use the following scripts in order to generate the HTML5 website:

-   The `build.sh` / `build.bat` script generates the website into the `public` folder.
-   The `server.sh` / `server.bat` script starts *Hugo* in [server mode](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/) and allows live preview of modified files in the web browser via
    -   <http://localhost:1313/en/> for the English website
    -   <http://localhost:1314/de/> for the German website


### How to generate other formats

In order to generate other formats you need to install [*Pandoc*](https://pandoc.org/) on your system. Currently this repository only provides a solution for *Linux* systems. Other operating systems might also work with some modifications, but we're currently not planning to support other systems.

Follow the [instructions provided by *Pandoc*](https://pandoc.org/installing.html#linux) for installation. For PDF output [*TeX Live*](http://www.tug.org/texlive/) is also required.

You also need to install [*Python*](https://www.python.org/) and the [*virtualenv*](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) package on your system. Most *Linux* distributions provide packages for both dependencies. Afterwards you can create a virtual environment for *Python* by executing the `app/init-virtualenv.sh` script.

On *Debian GNU/Linux* you can install the dependencies via:

```
apt install \
  virtualenv \
  pandoc \
  texlive-latex-base \
  texlive-lang-german \
  texlive-lang-english \
  texlive-fonts-recommended \
  texlive-fonts-extra \
  texlive-latex-recommended \
  texlive-latex-extra
```

After all dependencies are installed you can use the following scripts on your *Linux* system in order to generate the manual in other target formats:

-   The `book-english.sh` script generates the manual into the `book/en` folder.
-   The `book-german.sh` script generates the manual into the `book/de` folder.


### How to modify the users manual

The [`content`](content) folder contains development files of the manual in [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and provided images.

-   The [`content/en`](content/en) folder contains all development files of the English manual.
-   The [`content/de`](content/de) folder contains all development files of the German manual. 

Open the Markdown files (ending with `.md`) in your preferred text editor and make your changes. Afterwards you can rebuild the manual with the provided scripts (as documented above).


### Notes about the Markdown format, standards & conventions

In order to provide a consistent users manual we've established some standards and conventions. Please read the following documents before you modify the contents and provide a pull request:

-   The [`NOTES.en.md`](NOTES.en.md) file contains information & conventions about the English users manual.
-   The [`NOTES.de.md`](NOTES.de.md) file contains information & conventions about the German users manual.
-   The [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file contains information about how to provide you modifications to us.

The aim of this project is to perform a data exploration for the real estate French market and to have a good understanding of available variables and the market with a real world 5-years (from 2015 to 2019)
historical sales transactions for the top 9 french cities (Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Nice, Montpellier, Nantes).
The dataset contains details for each transaction (sale date, localization, type of residence, type of sale, land area, living area,
number of rooms, price, etc.).

The project was done using Tableau PrepBuilder for data preparation and cleaning and Tableau Desktop for data visualisation and storytelling with user friendly commands.

The final storytelling on Tableau Desktop is divided into the following steps:
- description of the context
- cities overview
- type of sales analysis
- living and land area analysis
- market understanding
- market evolution over time
- summary table per city
- investments recommendations

**Welcome to Blockchain Housing Cooperative Management! This project aims to leverage blockchain technology to provide an efficient, transparent, and secure platform for managing housing cooperatives.**

## Introduction

Traditionally, housing cooperatives have faced challenges in areas such as record keeping, transparency, property ownership transfer, and fund management. Our project addresses these challenges by harnessing the power of blockchain technology. We are creating a decentralized application (DApp) that will maintain a record of all houses owned by the cooperative, track the owners of each house, and handle transactions related to these properties, all in a secure and transparent manner.

This platform will use smart contracts - self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. For our project, we'll be using Solidity for Ethereum blockchain and PyTeal for Algorand blockchain. These smart contracts will handle tasks such as adding new houses to the cooperative, changing ownership, and managing funds for house purchases.

Our project will offer benefits like improved transparency, as every transaction will be recorded on the blockchain and can be audited. It will also increase efficiency, as transactions and changes of ownership can be handled within the blockchain without the need for a middleman. Lastly, it ensures higher security and trust as the blockchain ledger is immutable and every transaction can be traced and verified.

The end goal of this project is to revolutionize how housing cooperatives are managed, by bringing them into the digital age and making them more secure, efficient, and transparent. Whether you are part of a housing cooperative, interested in the potential of blockchain technology, or just curious to see how decentralized applications can be used in new and exciting ways, we invite you to join us on this journey of innovation.

## Quick Start

> Install

``` sh
npm i
```

> Compile

``` sh
npm run compile
```

## Contract

The contract will keep track of the houses owned by the cooperative, and it will allow new houses to be added to the cooperative's list of properties. For simplicity, each house will be represented by an address (to mimic a unique identifier), and it will be recorded along with the owner's name.

- This contract adds houses to an array and allows the owner of a house to change the owner name. There's also an event that will be emitted when a new house is added.
- This contract assumes that each house has a unique Ethereum address, which is used as an identifier. It also assumes that the person executing the contract (msg.sender) is the house owner. This contract might not cover your actual needs, and it's advised to get in touch with a Solidity developer who can help create a more complex contract that covers all your needs.
- Each house has a price and can be put up for sale. Members can buy a house if it is for sale and if they send enough Ether. The Ether is then added to the previous owner's balance. Members can withdraw their funds at any time.
- This contract assumes  that the price of each house is 1 Ether and that transactions only happen between members of the cooperative.
- This contract assumes that the price of each house is static and set when the house is added. In a real contract, you might want to allow the price to change over time or have some mechanism to determine the price dynamically.

*Please be aware that smart contracts handling real-world assets can have legal implications and may require a legal framework beyond the smart contract itself to be enforceable and effective.*

Notes about JDK versions below 11
---------------------------------

JAXB is bundled with JDK 8, was disabled / deprecated in JDK 9 & 10 and finally removed in JDK 11. Therefore, we're providing JAXB as an explicit dependency. See also [""JAXB on Java 9, 10, 11 and beyond""](https://www.jesperdj.com/2018/09/30/jaxb-on-java-9-10-11-and-beyond/). 

It is recommended to use this library with JDK 11 as it should work out of the box. In case you're using JDK 8, you might need to follow one of these steps documented at [""JAXB Release Documentation""](https://javaee.github.io/jaxb-v2/doc/user-guide/release-documentation.html#deployment-migrating-jaxb-2-0-applications-to-javase-6):

> JavaSE comes with JAXB 2.x API/implementation in `rt.jar`. Each version of JavaSE (6, 7, 8, ...) contains different version of JAXB 2.x API. Therefore, if you want to use different version of JAXB API/implementation than the one present in your version of JDK, you are required to override a portion of `rt.jar` with the new API. There are several ways to achieve this:
> 
> 1.    Place the `jakarta.xml.bind-api-X.Y.Z.jar` into `$JRE_HOME/lib/endorsed`. **Do not put other JAXB jars into the endorsed directory.** This essentially makes your JRE to ""JRE X + JAXB 2.y"". This would affect any other applications that use this JRE, and it's easy. On the other hand, in various scenarios you may not be able to alter the JRE.
> 
> 2.    Use the system property `java.endorsed.dirs` when you launch your application, and have it point to the directory which contains the `jakarta.xml.bind-api-X.Y.Z.jar` only. **The directory must not contain any other jaxb artifacts.** This allows you to use different version of JAXB for different applications. 
> 
> See the [endorsed directory mechanism](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/standards/) for more details.

All provided dependencies should work with JDK 8. If compatibility problems occur, you might replace them with an earlier version.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to make it really easy and quick to transfer data between participants in the real estate investment management industry.

I believe the solution is to establish industry standard protocols between data senders and receipients. Together, we will try to achieve this by building adapters and common data models in this project so that anybody can use them.

The framework and ideas of this Project are heavily borrowed from the original [Data Transfer Project](https://datatransferproject.dev). As suggested by the naming of this project, our approach is to extend these ideas and create the implementation as it applies to the real estate industry.

## Current state

This project is just starting. Please register your interest in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/itsrobli/data-transfer-project-real-estate-industry/discussions/2).

I am looking for people to contribute to the project. Together, we will continuing to define the architecture and implementation. Please participate in the [open issues](https://github.com/itsrobli/data-transfer-project-real-estate-industry/issues).

Any code in the repo is in active development, please do thorough testing and verification before implementing for production use.

# Background

##  Background to the problem

In the real estate industry, we frequently exchange a lot of information and data with each other because joint ownership of assets is very common. Every reporting period (usually monthly), real estate property, investment, and fund managers send each other tonnes of data so each can have a wholistic package of data to suit their own reporting and analytics needs.

Given everyone has their own systems and processes, there is work on both ends of the transporation of data:

- **Sender of data**: The Sender of the data must process it into the right data shape and reporting format for the receipient (it's common a PDF management report and some Excel tables is provided). This deliverable is often different to the way the sender reports the same information internally. In addition, each receipient will specify their own requirements which are often different from other receipients - this compounds the amount of work for the Sender. 

- **Receipient**: The receipient of this data often must translate the information into what their home systems will understand because this data will feed into various other reporting and analytics requirements. The logical question is, didn't the Sender do this work already? Yes, if only the world was so perfect!

Typically every month, these processes are done manually by an army of finance people across the industry who spend days and weeks translating each other‚Äôs spreadsheets into their home system.

## Motivations and goals

The motivation is to stop the suffering caused by this manual translation of data back and forth. This can be achieved by making sure the sender and the receipient are aligned by defininig a common sharing protocol.

Given it's a common problem with limited specialist resources to solve it, and requires widespread adoption, running it as an open source project is the best way to concentrate the effort and ensure everyone can benefit and use it.

# Architecture

The system's main goal is to make it easy for a new participant to adopt the standards and get immediate benefit. Principles to follow to enable this:

- Use existing standards where possible - for example, don't re-invent REST or OAuth.

- The majority of work for a new Participant should be on the Adapters that enable import and export functionality. They should not have to modify their existing APIs, authorisation systems, and other internal core systems.

- DTP-REI infrastructure deployment should be standard (i.e. Docker).

## System components

1. **Data Models‚Äã** are the canonical formats that establish a common understanding of how to
transfer data.

2. **Adapters‚Äã** provide a method for converting each Participant's proprietary data and
authentication formats into a form that is usable by the system (and therefore other Participants).

3. **Task Management Library**‚Äã provides the plumbing to power the system.

![DTP-REI high level architecture](/documentation/dtp-rei-architecture-components.png)

### Data Models

The Data Model for transferring data assets consists of two parts: a file type and the additional metadata needed by the receiving Participant to accurately import the data. For example with financial data, the file type might be a standard format such as CSV, and the metadata would include information such as general ledger account code, description, period, amount, etc.

Data Models are clustered together, typically by industry grouping, to form Verticals. A Participant could have data in one or more Verticals. Verticals could be financials, tenants, properties, etc. Each Vertical has its own set of Data Models that enable seamless transfer of the relevant file types. For example, the Financials Vertical could have Data Models for cashflows, forecasts, budgets, and valuations.

Ideally, a Vertical will have a small number of well-defined and widely-adopted Data Models. In such a situation, the generally accepted standard will be used as the Data Model for that Vertical across real estate management companies and funds. This is not currently the case for most Verticals because Data Models have emerged organically in a largely disconnected ecosystem.

One goal of the DTP-REI is to encourage organisations to use common Data Models in their systems, which will happen if organisations take importing and exporting data into consideration when initially designing their systems or providing updates. Using a common Data Model will significantly reduce the need for companies to maintain and update proprietary APIs.

In the case where there is no standard Data Model for a Vertical, companies will want to collaborate and agree upon standardised Data Models, either during the DTP-REI development or in collaboration with external standards bodies. Without collaboration, each provider could have their own Data Model, and would have to create Adapters that would have to support the same number of Data Models as there are companies in the Vertical, which would reduce the usefulness of the DTP-REI.

Even where standard Data Models do exist, collaboration will be an ongoing and mutually beneficial shared commitment as APIs will need to be maintained to handle new features, evolving standards, or innovative new formats.

### Adapters

There are two main kinds of Adapters: Data Adapters and Authentication Adapters. These Adapters exist outside of a Participant's core systems and can be written either by the Participant itself, or by third parties that would like to enable data transfer to and from a Participant.

#### Data Adapters

Data Adapters are pieces of code that translate a given Participant‚Äôs APIs into Data Models used by the DTP-REI. Data Adapters come in pairs: an exporter that translates from the Participant's API into the Data Model, and an importer that translates from the Data Model into the Participant's API.

#### Authentication Adapters

Authentication Adapters are pieces of code that allow users (likely employees of the organisations) to authenticate their accounts before transferring data out of or into another Participant's systems. OAuth is likely to be the choice for most Participants, however the DTP-REI is agnostic to the type of authentication.

Note: Under this system, emailing spreadsheets could be seen as a type of transport and authentication.


### Task Management - the plumbing

The Task Management Libraries handle background tasks, such as calls between the two relevant Adapters, secure data storage, retry logic, rate limiting, pagination management, failure handling, and individual notifications.

The DTP-REI aims to develope a collection of Task Management Libraries as a reference implementation for how to utilise the Adapters to transfer data between two Participants. If preferred, Participants can choose to write their own implementation of the Task Management Libraries that utilise the Data Models and Adapters of the DTP-REI.

## System deployment

The method of deployment will determine how the system's components work together. As with the original DTP, multiple deployment models should work. However, for now, we will focus on the distributed model.

This model requires at least one Participant to spin-up their own Host Platform using the relevent components of this project. 

As can be seen below, Participant C and E cannot directly transfer data to each other because neither has a Host Platform.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
