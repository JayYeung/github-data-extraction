## End of Support

Home Assistant has introduced local calendars in 2022, in the 2023.1 release they added an option for different recurent events. With this, most of the functionality of this custom helper is supported natively. So I will end developing and supporting this helper in 2023.

# Garbage Collection

The `garbage_collection` component is a Home Assistant helper that creates a custom sensor for monitoring a regular garbage collection schedule. The sensor can be configured for a number of different patterns:

- `weekly` schedule (including multiple collection days, e.g. on Tuesday and Thursday)
- `every-n-weeks` repeats every `period` of weeks, starting from the week number `first_week`. It uses the week number - therefore, it restarts each year, as the weeks start from number 1 each year.
- bi-weekly in `even-weeks` or `odd-weeks` (technically, it is the same as every 2 weeks with 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> `first_week`)
- `every-n-days` (repeats regularly from the given first date). If n is a multiply of 7, it works similar to `every-n-weeks`, with the difference that it does not use the week numbers (that restart each year) but continues infinitely from the initial date.
- `monthly` schedule (n<sup>th</sup> weekday each month), or a specific weekday of each n<sup>th</sup> week. Using the `period` it could also be every 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> etc month.
- `annually` (e.g. birthdays). This is once per year. Using include dates, you can add additional dates manually.
- `blank` does not automatically schedule any collections - to be used in cases where you want to make completely own schedule with `manual_update`.

You can also configure seasonal calendars (e.g. for bio-waste collection), by configuring the first and last month.
And you can `group` entities, which will merge multiple schedules into one sensor.

These are some examples using this sensor. The Lovelace config examples are included below.

## Installation

### MANUAL INSTALLATION

1. Download the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bruxy70/garbage_collection/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the release and copy the `custom_components/garbage_collection` directory
   into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant
   installation.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Configure the `garbage_collection` helper.

### INSTALLATION VIA Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)

1. Ensure that [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Search for and install the ""Garbage Collection"" integration.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Configure the `garbage_collection` helper.

## Configuration

Go to `Settings`/`Devices & Services`/`Helpers`, click on the `+ CREATE HELPER` button, select `Garbage Collection` and configure the helper.<br />If you would like to add more than one collection schedule, click on the `+ CREATE HELPER` button again and add another `Garbage Collection` helper instance.

**The configuration hapend in 2 steps.** In the first step, you select the `frequency` and common parameters. In the second step you configure additional parameters depending on the selected frequency.

_The configuration via `configuration.yaml` has been deprecated. If you have previously configured the integration there, it will be imported to ConfigFlow, and you should remove it._

| `First week` | No       | First collection on the `""first week""` week (integer 1-53)<br/>**Default**: 1<br/>_(The week number is using [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Week_dates) numeric representation of the week)<br/><br/>Note: This parameter cannot be used to set the beginning of the collection period (use the `first month` parameter for that). The purpose of `first week` is to simply 'offset' the week number, so the collection every ;'n' weeks does not always trigger on week numbers that are multiplication of 'n'. Technically, the value of this parameter shall be less than `period`, otherwise it will give weird results. Also note, that the week numbers restart each year. Use `every-n-days` frequency if you need a consistent period across the year ends._ |

#### ...FOR COLLECTION EVERY-N-DAYS

| `Period`     | No       | Collection every `""period""` days (warning - in this configuration, it is days, not weeks!)<br/>**Default**: 1 (daily, which makes no sense I suppose) |

#### ...FOR MONTHLY COLLECTION

The monthly schedule has two flavors: it can trigger either on the **n<sup>th</sup> occurrence of the weekday** in a month, or on the weekday in the **n<sup>th</sup> week** of each month.

| Parameter                                 | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Order of weekday`                        | Yes      | List of week numbers of `collection day` each month. E.g., if `collection_day` is `""sat""`, 1 will mean 1<sup>st</sup> Saturday each month (integer 1-5)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Order of week, instead of weekday order` | No       | **CONFIGURE THIS ONE ONLY IF YOU ARE SURE YOU NEED IT**. This will **alter** the behaviour of `order of weekday`, so that instead of n<sup>th</sup> weekday of each month, take the weekday of the n<sup>th</sup> week of each month.</br>So if the month starts on Friday, the Wednesday of the 1<sup>st</sup> week would actually be last Wednesday of the previous month and the Wednesday of 2<sup>nd</sup> week will be the 1<sup>st</sup> Wednesday of the month. So if you have just randomy clicked on the option, it might appear as if it calculates a wrong date! Yes, this is confusing, but there are apparently some use case for this. |
| `Period`                                  | No       | If `period` is not defined (or 1), the schedule will repeat monthly. If `period` is 2, it will be every 2<sup>nd</sup> month. If `period` is 3, it will be once per quarter, and so on.<br/>The `first month` parameter will then define the starting month. So if the `first month` is `jan` (or not defined), and `period` is 2, the collection will be in odd months (`jan`, `mar`, `may`, `jul`, `sep` and `nov`). If `first month` is `feb`, it will be in even months. (integer 1-12)<br/>**Default**: 1                                                                                                                                        |

| :-------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Date`    | Yes      | The date of collection, in format `'mm/dd'` (e.g. '11/24' for November 24 each year) |

#### ...FOR GROUP

| Parameter          | Required | Description                     |

| `List of entities` | Yes      | A list of `entity_id`s to merge |

## Blueprints for Manual Update

### Prerequisites

1. To use the **blueprints**, you need to set the `garbage_collection` entity for `Manual update`, that will fire the `garbage_collection_loaded` event on each sensor update and trigger the automation **blueprint**.
2. Install/Import **blueprint**
3. From the **blueprint**, create and configure the automation

### Public Holidays

There are a couple of **blueprints**, automatically moving the collection falling on a public holiday. Or if there was a public holiday in the week before the scheduled collection.

The Public Holidays **blueprints** use a separate custom helper **Holidays**, available through **HACS**, that you can configure for different countries.

### Offset

The offset blueprint will move the calculated collections by a number of days. This can be used, for example, to schedule collection for last Saturday each month - just set the collection to the first Saturday each month and offset it by -7 days.

### Import txt

This **blueprint** requires a `command_line` sensor reading content of a txt file, containig a set of dates, one per line.

<details>
<summary>command_line sensor example</summary>

The Home Assistant command line sensor has a 255 character limitation. For many people this causes an issue where the sensor only imports part of the list. To overcome this limitation, @stu1811 came up with this brilliant solution.

Create a script that shows next 20 dates from the current day forward.

#### **`/share/import_dates.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
new_dates=$(for x in $(cat /share/import_dates.txt); do
                if [[ $(date -d $x +""%y%m%d"") -ge $(date +""%y%m%d"") ]]; then
                    echo $x
                fi
            done)
echo ""$new_dates"" | head -n20
```

Then, create the command line sensor taking the output of this script.

#### **`configuration.yaml`**

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: command_line
    name: Import dates
    command: ""sh /share/import_dates.sh""
```

</details>

### Monthly on a fixed date

This will create a schedule on a fixed date each month. For example on the 3rd each month. The helper does not allow it, as it is generally designed around paterns evolving around weekly schedules (since garbage collection typically happens on a set day in a week, rather than set day in a month). But few of you wanted that, so here you go.

## STATE AND ATTRIBUTES

### State

The state can be one of

| Value | Meaning                |
| :---- | :--------------------- |
| `0`   | Collection is today    |
| `1`   | Collection is tomorrow |
| `2`   | Collection is later    |

If the `verbose_state` parameter is set, it will show the date, and the remaining days. For example: ""Today"" or ""Tomorrow"" or ""on 10-Sep-2019, in 2 days"" (configurable)

### Attributes

| Attribute         | Description                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `next_date`       | The date of next collection              |
| `days`            | Days till the next collection            |
| `last_collection` | The date and time of the last collection |

## Services

### `garbage_collection.collect_garbage`

If the collection is scheduled for today, mark it completed and look for the next collection.
It will set the `last_collection` attribute to the current date and time.

| Attribute         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id`       | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `last_collection` | (optional) Set the last collection date to this value. This can be used to re-set the next collection calculation, if the last collection date was set in error. If omitted, it will set the last collection to the current date & time. |

## Manual update

There are standard [blueprints](#blueprints-for-manual-update) provided to handle manual updates - to move collection on public holidays or offset the collection.

If these **blueprints** do not work for you, you can create your own custom rules to handle any scenario. If you do so, please share the blueprints with the others by posting them to the [blueprints directory](https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/tree/master/blueprints) - someone else might find them useful. Thanks!
To help you with creating custom automations, see the following examples:

```

### `garbage_collection.add_date`

Add a date to the list of dates calculated automatically. To add multiple dates, call this service multiple-times with different dates.
Note that this date will be removed on the next sensor update, when the data is re-calculated and loaded. This is why, this service should be called from the automation triggered by the event `garbage_collection_loaded`. This event is called each time the sensor is updated. And at the end of this automation, you need to call the `garbage_collection.update_state` service to update the sensor state based on automatically collected dates, and the dates added, removed, or offset by the automation.

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                  |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                               |
| `date`      | The date to be added, in ISO format (`'yyyy-mm-dd'`). Make sure to enter the date in quotes! |

### `garbage_collection.remove_date`

Remove a date to the list of dates calculated automatically. To remove multiple dates, call this service multiple-times with different dates.
Note that this date will be removed on the next sensor update, when the data is re-calculated and loaded. This is why, this service should be called from the automation triggered by the event `garbage_collection_loaded`. This event is called each time the sensor is updated. And at the end of this automation, you need to call the `garbage_collection.update_state` service to update the sensor state based on automatically collected dates, and the dates added, removed, or offset by the automation.

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                    |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                                 |
| `date`      | The date to be removed, in ISO format (`'yyyy-mm-dd'`). Make sure to enter the date in quotes! |

### `garbage_collection.offset_date`

Offset the calculated collection day by the `offset` number of days.
Note that this date will be removed on the next sensor update, when the data is re-calculated and loaded. This is why, this service should be called from the automation triggered by the event `garbage_collection_loaded`. This event is called each time the sensor is updated. And at the end of this automation, you need to call the `garbage_collection.update_state` service to update the sensor state based on automatically collected dates, and the dates added, removed, or offset by the automation.

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                    |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`)                                 |
| `date`      | The date to be removed, in ISO format (`'yyyy-mm-dd'`). Make sure to enter the date in quotes! |
| `offset`    | By how many days to offset - integer between `-31` to `31` (e.g. `1`)                          |

### `garbage_collection.update_state`

Choose the next collection date from the list of dates calculated automatically, added by service calls (and not removed), and update the entity state and attributes.

| Attribute   | Description                                                    |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`) |

## Events

### `garbage_collection_loaded`

This event is triggered each time a `garbage_collection` entity is being updated. You can create an automation to modify the collection schedule before the entity state update.

Event data:
| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `entity_id` | The garbage collection entity id (e.g. `sensor.general_waste`) |
| `collection_dates` | List of collection dates calculated automatically. |

## Manual update examples

For the example below, the entity should be configured with `manual_update` set to `true`.
Then, when the `garbage_collection` entity is updated (normally once a day at midnight, or restart, or when triggering entity update by script), it will calculate the collection schedule for previous, current and next year. But it will **NOT UPDATE** the entity state.
Instead, it will trigger an event `garbage_collection_loaded` with a list of automatically calculated dates as a parameter.
You will **have to create an automation triggered by this event**. In this automation, you will need to call the service `garbage_collection.update_state` to update the state. Before that, you can call the services `garbage_collection.add_date` and/or `garbage_collection.remove_date` and/or `garbage_collection.offset_date` to programmatically tweak the dates in whatever way you need (e.g. based on values from external API sensor, comparing the dates with the list of holidays, calculating custom offsets based on the day of the week etc.). This is complicated but gives you the ultimate flexibility.

## Simple example

Adding an extra collection date (a fixed date in this case) - for the entity `sensor.test`.

```yaml
alias: garbage_collection event
description: ""Manually add a collection date, then trigger entity state update.""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: garbage_collection_loaded
    event_data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
action:
  - service: garbage_collection.add_date
    data:
      entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
      date: ""2022-01-07""
  - service: garbage_collection.update_state
    data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
mode: single
```

## Moderate example

This will loop through the calculated dates, and add an extra collection to a day after each calculated one. So if this is set for a collection every first Wednesday each month, it will result in a collection on the first Wednesday, and the following day (kind of first Thursday, except if the week is starting on Thursday - just a random weird example :).

This example is for an entity `sensor.test`. If you want to use it for yours, replace it with the real entity name in the trigger.

```yaml
alias: test garbage_collection event
description: ""Loop through all calculated dates, add extra collection a day after the calculate one""
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: garbage_collection_loaded
    event_data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
action:
  - repeat:
      for_each: ""{{ trigger.event.data.collection_dates }}""
      sequence:
        - service: garbage_collection.add_date
          data:
            entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
            date: >-
              {{( as_datetime(repeat.item) + timedelta( days = 1)) | as_timestamp | timestamp_custom(""%Y-%m-%d"") }}
  - service: garbage_collection.update_state
    data:
      entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
mode: single
```

## Advanced example

This is an equivalent of ""holiday in week"" move - checking if there is a public holiday on the calculated collection day, or earlier in the week. And if yes, moving the collection by one day. This is fully custom logic, so it could be further complicated by whatever rules anyone wants.

This example is for an entity `sensor.test`. If you want to use it for yours, replace it with a real entity name in the trigger.

```yaml
alias: test garbage_collection event
description: >-
  Loop through all calculated dates, move the collection by 1 day if a public holiday was in the week before or on the calculated collection date calculate one
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: garbage_collection_loaded
    event_data:
      entity_id: sensor.test
action:
  - repeat:
      for_each: ""{{ trigger.event.data.collection_dates }}""
      sequence:
        - condition: template
          value_template: >-
            {%- set collection_date = as_datetime(repeat.item) %}
            {%- set ns = namespace(found=false) %}
            {%- for i in range(collection_date.weekday()+1) %}
              {%- set d = ( collection_date + timedelta( days=-i) ) | as_timestamp | timestamp_custom(""%Y-%m-%d"") %}
              {%- if d in state_attr(trigger.event.data.entity_id,'holidays') %}
                {%- set ns.found = true %}
              {%- endif %}
            {%- endfor %}  
            {{ ns.found }}
        - service: garbage_collection.offset_date
          data:
            entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
            date: ""{{ repeat.item }}""
            offset: 1
  - service: garbage_collection.update_state
    data:
      entity_id: ""{{ trigger.event.data.entity_id }}""
mode: single
```

# Lovelace config examples

For information/inspiration - not supported.

## Garbage Collection custom card

You can use the custom [garbage collection card](https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card) developed by @amaximus.

<img src=""https://github.com/amaximus/garbage-collection-card/blob/master/garbage_collection_lovelace.jpg"">

## With images (picture-entity)

This is what I use (I like images). I use a horizontal stack of picture-entities, with `card-templater` plugin ([Lovelace Card Templater](https://github.com/gadgetchnnel/lovelace-card-templater)) to show the number of days:

<img src=""https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/picture-entity.png"">

(The `state` is designed to be used as traffic lights. That's why it has 3 values. You obviously cannot use this with `verbose_state`)

This is the configuration

```yaml
- type: ""custom:card-templater""
  card:
    type: picture-entity
    name_template: >-
      {{ state_attr('sensor.bio','days') }} days
    show_name: True
    show_state: False
    entity: sensor.bio
    state_image:
      ""0"": ""/local/containers/bio_today.png""
      ""1"": ""/local/containers/bio_tomorrow.png""
      ""2"": ""/local/containers/bio_off.png""
  entities:
    - sensor.bio
```

## List view (entities)

The simplest visualization is to use entities. In this case, I use `verbose_state` to show `state` as text.

<img src=""https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection/blob/master/images/entities.png"">

Lovelace configuration

```yaml
- type: entities
  entities:
    - sensor.general_waste
    - sensor.bio
    - sensor.paper
    - sensor.plastic
```

## Icon view (glance)

Garbage Truck Monitoring System is a role based system having three roles admin, driver and a citizen. Admin has a dashboard from which admin can add resources such as drivers, bins, depot, dumping ground and vehicles. Admin will have facility of viewing the current data in the system and monitor the drivers in real time. 

![Alt text](screenshots/dashboard.jpeg?raw=true ""Dashboard"")


The new bin location can be added by just clicking on the map or writing the address of the actual location. Its capacity and height needs to be entered as those parameters will be used to calculate real time garbage level of the bin.  

![Alt text](screenshots/addBin.jpeg?raw=true ""Add a bin"")


The bin status will be shown to admin wherein bins are classified into three categories based on the level of garbage. Red, yellow and green bins represent overfilled bin, normally filled bin and underfilled bin respectively.

![Alt text](screenshots/binStatus.jpeg?raw=true ""Bin Status"")


The routes will be generated using our algorithm which follows the approach followed by CVRP algorithm. Daily, routes will be generated taking into account the real time garbage level, capacity of vehicles, the distance between bins, etc. G Maps API provides an efficient way and real time distances according to the traffic parameter for the inputs.

This Waste Management System is a web application aimed to provide a digital way of complaining the concerns of general citizens to their relative municipalities.,"# [Waste Management System](https://waste-managemnt-system.000webhostapp.com/)

As we know, importance of waste management has always been a great concern nowadays. The world is sinking into the sea of waste. Every narrow nooks and corner of the streets are being piled up with waste. Waste management reduces the effect of waste on the environment, health, and so on. It can also help reuse or recycle resources, such as; paper, cans, glass, and so on. There is various type of waste management that include the disposal of solid, liquid, gaseous, or hazardous substances. 



The ‘Waste Management System’ is a web application aimed to provide a digital way of complaining the concerns of general citizens to their relative municipalities.
1. Complaining about waste or garbage problems near their locality.
2. See thier complain Report and check if the work is done! or not.
3. people can take different ideas regarding recycling of waste through this website.

Complaining about the waste problem encountered everyday to municipality is hefty process and waste management aims to make this process easier. With a simple handheld device with access to internet, user can use this platform complain their concerns to municipality . The automated system will redirect the complains .The municipality admins at the receiving side can acknowledge the reports which lets the users whether their complain is adddressed or not.

# AquaVision
Official dataset introduced in the paper [AquaVision: Automating the detection of waste in water bodies using deep transfer learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscee.2020.100026)

# AquaTrash

This dataset contains 369 images of Trash used for deep learning. Each image is manually labelled by our team for accurate detections making a total of 470 bounding boxes. There are total 4 classes {(0: glass), (1:paper), (2:metal), (3:plastic)}

# Usage
1. Each image stored in the images folder has one or more labelled bounding boxes. 
2. The labelled bounding box are stored in the annotations.csv file with the following format:
  ```
  <file_path>,<x_min>,<y_min>,<x_max>,<y_max>

## ML Based Waste Segregator

#### This Repository consists of 2 branch, ML code and backend Flask app is in flask-app branch and React.js web-app is in react-app branch. So do check both branch's readme.

#### Checkout our webpage:<a href=""https://waste-segregation-frontend.herokuapp.com""> Here </a>

#### 1. What is the definition that you are working on 
We are working on the poblem of Waste Management. We have observed that a lot cities, states and even countries faces problem on how to manage waste. Waste Management system have a golden 3R rule Recycle Reuse Reduce. But, it becomes more effecient if we include also consider the classification in Biodegradable and Non Biodegradable. As the Biodegradable waste can be used to produce biogas and various useful side products. 
    
#### 2. How are we trying to solve the problem ?
Here, we are making Deep Learning Model of Waste segregation which will identify the type of waste i.e., Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable (Sub class: Recyclable, Resuable). This model then can be deployed at the dumping area, where the waste will be rolled on the conveyer-belt, then the Mechanic machine can segregate the waste. Since, the mechanic model is not possible in online mode, we will be deploying this model on a website, where the images of waste can be uploaded, and the model classify it.

#### 3. The Tech stack we used
Tensorflow, Flask, React.js, Heroku

#### 4. Working of our project
We have developed Machine Learning app which classify image of waste into Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable. This app is deployed at this [link1](https://ml-waste-segregation.herokuapp.com/). This app serves as backend and server for the frontend app, which is deployed at this [link2](https://wastesegregation-react.herokuapp.com/). The frontend app is made by using React. One can upload the image of the waste, then there will be output of image with its types. Both of this apps are deployed on heroku separately and integrated with each other.

The availability of widely adopted (de-facto standard) information models is key for creating a global digital single market of interoperable and replicable (portable) IoT-enabled smart solutions in multiple domains. Such models provide an essential element in the common technical ground needed for standards-based open innovation and procurement.

Data Models play a crucial role because they define the harmonised representation formats and semantics that will be used by applications both to consume and to publish data.

The Smart Data Models board (FIWARE Foundation, TM Forum, OASC and IUDX) are leading a joint collaboration program to support the adoption of a reference architecture and compatible common data models that underpin a digital market of interoperable and replicable smart solutions in multiple sectors.

This GitHub repository contains links to the repositories where different groups or data models are contained. Data models are documented in JSON Schemas and automatic documentation is generated based on the schemas.

Submission the [Climate Change AI Hackathon 2019, Montreal](https://climate-change-ai-hackathon.devpost.com/), see [DevPost post](https://devpost.com/software/yocco-you-only-live-once).
We have created an application that uses Deep Learning to detect objects and classifies the method for waste management (recycling, compost, trash, hazardous).

## Motivation
The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in our landfills and incineration plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the extraction and processing of virgin materials has on the environment. New products can be made from your recyclable waste material.
It all comes back to you. **Recycling gets down to one person taking action.** 

## Webapp

Built with Flask. Following [this tutorial](https://github.com/avinassh/pytorch-flask-api-heroku/blob/master/README.md).

Run the server:

	FLASK_ENV=development FLASK_APP=app.py python3.5 -m flask run

And upload pictures to try out the garbage detection AI. Example test images are in `test_images`.

## Image Recognition
Our image recognition models are based on pre-trained models (DenseNet121 and MobileNet, trained on ImageNet) provided by [Torch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html) and [Keras](https://keras.io/applications/#mobilenet). We fine-tuned MobileNet to classify garbage material based on the [TrashNet data collection](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet).

# REDIVIVUS
An end-to-end recyclable waste management website.<br/>
Successfully Deployed using firebase hosting. View the deployment [here](https://redivivuspickupguy.web.app/).<br/>

## Problem Statement 
To design and create a product (website) where users / consumers / retailers can easily schedule their recyclable waste pickup according to their convenience with standardized pricing across cities 

## Objectives

<img align=""right"" width=""40%"" src=""https://github.com/Vivek-Hotti/REDIVIVUS/blob/main/images%26visuals/stakeholders.JPG""> 

* To bridge the gap between various stake holders of the Recyclable Waste ecosystem. 
* Facilitate a dynamic website to users with a personalized experience to each one.
* Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.


## General Flow

In the existing system, the journey of a user who wants to sell his recyclable waste, starts with uncertainty and ends with frustation and disatisfaction.

Our main purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience, consistent pricing along with efficient recyclable waste logistics and transparency at every level.
The solution to the existing flawed system is: a recyclable waste management website.

The user comes on our website through the internet. As soon as he enters the website, he is asked to Login / Signup. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by
entering the date and time according to his convenience.

As soon as we receive a request, we take a note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the users’ house at the requested date and time. To ensure transparency we use a digital weighing machine and then and there itself reimburse the predecided amount to the user.

On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop of the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.

## Abstract 
This repo contains all of the codes for the prototype explained in the paper. I wrote it during my 2nd year of Computer Science studies and the idea for the garbage bin came to me while solving a Calculus exam question. The paper shortly elaborates the idea (it has some issues) for building a self-sustained sensor system, a hypothetical network composed of nodes implementing the Riemann Garbage Bin (RGB) model. The model is named after the creator of the formula, Riemann Sum approximaties an integral by a finite sum.

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zelenelez/images/master/model.png"" width=45%;></img>
</p>

Hence, the case study explores the potential of employing sensor-enabled systems to improve waste monitoring and management in public waste bins. The network consists of wireless nodes that use ultrasonic sensors to measure the space in the bins. The sensors periodically report the fill rate of the waste bins to a sensor gateway that is based on the Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol. For our LoRaWAN server and network cover, we choose to use The Things Network (TTN). These fill rates would be monitored by a mobile or web application connected to the network server. The goal of this project is through the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor all the waste bins in one city, to improve garbage management by relocating resources, and by giving insight to the public about this global health threatening problem.

## Functional application (React Native)

This application was produced as part of a larger project course where the following aim was adressed *“Create a feedback loop from individualized user data to create incentives to improve waste management behaviour.”*. The application is intended to be used as a complementary feedback loop for residents in Stockholm Royal Seaport (SRS) http://www.stockholmroyalseaport.com/ where an automated vacuum system for waste management is implemented. The application utilizes gamification, and considers various psychological aspects to improve sorting and management of waste. Read more about the project and our story: https://erikskogetun.github.io/WasteManagement/.

### Run project locally

The application is built in React Native and Expo. So simply run `npm install` to install all the dependencies, and then `npm start` to run the app in Expo. Then follow the instruction to run in simulator or on native device. We built the app mainly to support iOS and iPhone 11 Pro Max, but should work fine with some minor adjustments for other devices and Android as well.

### Your waste, our responsibility.

### Problem
In the 21st century, <b>lack of a proper waste management system</b> is one of the
biggest problems faced around the world. Out of the 62 million tonnes of
waste generated annually, only 43 million tonnes is collected, out of which
11.9 million tonnes is treated and 31 million tonnes is dumped in landfill
sites. This system urgently calls for a change.
<br>
### Analysis
According to a study, you can actually improve and <b>reduce this waste by
over 15% just by segregating it</b> properly at the first hand.
<br>

### Solution
Owing to this, we are introducing a start-up idea, Klear – a mobile app
for waste management. 
<br><br>
Through our app, we encourage people to
contribute to reducing the amount of waste by ensuring that a proper waste
segregation system is followed.
<br><br>
* In our app, we have inculcated a mathematical solution using <b>convolutional
neural networks</b> (a machine learning interface) created by us that <b>lets users
classify their waste</b> into different 7 different classes and further place a
pickup order through our app. This makes it easier for the users to
conveniently segregate and dispose their waste. Instead of dumping that
waste, <b>we deliver it to the recyclers for better utilisation</b>. This way we’re
saving the environment. For incentivizing our solution, the <b>users also earn
Klear Credits in the form of digital money in proportion to the waste
contributed which can be further used on e-commerce portals</b>.
<br><br>
* For instance, if a user does not want to sell his ‘waste’, he can use the DIY
feature of our app. <b>The DIY feature gives out various step-by-step best out
of waste suggestions</b> in reference to the waste the user has classified.
<br><br>
* We also allow our users to donate the digital money earned by selling their
waste through the Klear Donation Form. We have ties with local NGOs, blind schools, orphanages, and old-age homes that receive the digital money
you donate through our app.

# Abstract
Harvest Easy represents a modern solution for an old and known problem: domestic waste sorting, resolving this at 360 degrees. We designed this from the really ground root, starting from the 3D CADs of the prototype up to the backend AI-powered solution and the user-friendly front-end, all equipped with the needed sensors & acturators. We started 3D printing with an organic plastic polymere (PLA) the bin prototype where we added on this the RFID reader, 16x2 LCD screen, two ESP32, different ultrasonic sensors HC-SR04, DHT11 for temperature and humidity, MQ135 for CO2 & air quality sensoring, MPU-6050 as accellerometer and gryscope module, 5W photovoltaic panel, MG90s Hi-Torque servo for the automatic lid opening, 14500 Li rechargable battery and a Solar Panel Managment with BMS (Battery Managment System) module.

During the night the bin is powered by a battery which is recharged by a solar panel during the day.
Energy management is managed by the BMS which switches between the battery and the panel based on the energy supplied by the panel itself

The bin can be in one out four states: empty and intact (state 1), full and intact (state 2), empty but tampered (state 3), full and tampered (state 4). The tampered state is achieved when the bin is knocked over or set on fire. Each time the bin lid is opened (by users or operators) its internal fill level and, consequently, the status is updated. If the bin is knocked over or set on fire, a notification will be sent to the apartment users through the telegram bot. If the problem cannot be solved, a report is also sent to the body responsible for waste collection (or public service) which will resolve it.

The telegram bot will give points to every user that solves a reported problem. We introduced this gamification system in which points can be earned and are eventually shown on a leaderboard through both the telegram bot and the service webpage. In this way we wanted to make users more aware & active towards our society.

In order to discourage and avoid the abandonment of waste next to the bin if happens to be full, Harvest Easy introduces a ""proximity access"" system: when the tenant swipes the card to authenticate in order to leave the trash but the bin happens to be full, the street address of the nearest free bin (respecting the waste sorting) will be shown on the screen (this is achieved thanks to open routing services built on top of OSM nodes).

Harvest Easy provides access to city maps through which it is possible to see all the bins present in the city of interest. We already implemented many intresing filters to satisfy both the commercial & analytics side and the wasting retrieval company one.

To improve the waste collection system, Harvest Easy is able to predict the possible future fill level, thanks to a time series model prediction. This feature is useful both for users and the company.

Harvest Easy provides a waste collection optimization system: taking into account the type of vehicle, the bins to be emptied, the prediction of bins close to being filled, and the fuel level to show the optimal route for the operator to travel. In this way only the full or almost full ones will be included in the retrieval path and is also already implemented a feature that computes the approximate kWh needed for the round trip, in this way only the (possibly autonomous but electrical) trucks with enough autonomy will depart.

## React Frontend

Once the apartment manager scans the bin group QR code for initialization he will be automatically redirected to the ap. init. portal on which he will add all the apartment infos such as:
- Location infos (apartment name, street, number, city)
- Tenants infos (how many, data for each including their telegram username)
- Waste sorting infos (which sorting that apartment will follow)

<img height=""600"" alt=""pic"" src=""./res/gif/apartment-init.gif""> 

<hr>


After the manager inits the apartment each user will be able to login

<img height=""600"" alt=""pic"" src=""./res/gif/user-login.gif""> 

<hr>

After the user logs in the apartment dashboard will be shown, here the status of each bin, infos about the apartment and future predictions are shown

<img height=""600"" alt=""pic"" src=""./res/gif/user-home.gif""> 



## Telegram Bot

Each user will be able to report for damages thus earning points, some special roles like civil servants, police etc will also be able to fix the damage and flag that; these roles won't earn points with the logic that is their duty to do this.


As we can see in this clip the bot (backend) is the first to multicast to every user in that city the damage, this is possible thank to the bin sensors which allow us to detect tampering as fire, overthrow or maximum capacity reached (this last is not flagged to users).

We introduced this bot along the city limited leaderboard for citizen too as a gamification of this problem

Love Food, Hate Waste

## Goal  
Ending hunger and food waste within our lifetimes.

## Mission
Connect businesses with excess edible food to feed those in need, instantly.

## Overview
Our platform uses technology to streamline the process of food recovery and distribution, giving businesses and organizations the power to fight hunger and food waste within minutes. The application helps to  minimize food wastage by effectively rescuing the excess food from weddings, parties, restaurants and temples and redeploying food resources in an efficient manner.

In this way, we wish to bridge the gap between these issues by connecting people and ensuring that the untouched left over food, can be distributed to people in need of food through reliable local NGO partners.

## Work flow

1. Share Food
Users who have excess food post their details such as - location, time when the food was made, number of people, cuisine type and additional data.

2. Transport Food
Anyone who can transport food, can contribute by delivering food from one location to another.

3. Request Food
NGOs or people who manage orphanages/shelter homes can request for food based on their requirements.

Waste segregation process leads to recycling of waste, energy generation out of waste, reduction of waste and lessening of land fills. Our system helps to enable the sustainability of the management sector with participation from both the municipalities and private agencies .The purpose of our smart waste collection system is to propose a method of identification that performs detection using images to identify the different types of waste containers.The main goal is to be able to successfully identify and classify waste containers in a reliable manner.The economic value of waste is best comprehended when it is segregated. The waste becomes valuable if it is segregated and recycled using the recent advancements in technology thereby becomes a useful entity. This conversion method of waste can be employed to generate synthetic gas made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The gas after burning can be used to produce steam and electricity, and for generation of bio fuels.Using convolution neural network, a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural network has successfully been applied to analyze the image. Thus, in waste segregation using deep learning involves acquiring images from camera with detection, object recognition, prediction and classification into categories as biodegradable and non- biodegradable.For this system to be sustainable,awareness of household preferences is essential for design of this system.With the advent of deep network architectures that deals with Big Data, provides the best in class performance in terms of accuracy, scalability, adaptability without any feature engineering.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

Waste Watcher is an IoT based sensor module to help keep track of waste data metrics with real-time bin fullness data and waste images. This is intended to help quantify and promote actionable solutions to reduce waste. This project is a continuation of [waste_watcher](https://github.com/zotbins/waste_watcher).

![](./imgs/waste_watcher.jpg)

## Features

- 🗑 Collect waste bin fullness telemetry
- 📷 Capture image of inside the waste bin
- 🔧 Fully customizable (adjust data collection rate, tweak case design for your needs, change camera settings, etc.)

## Why?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Simply put, we generate way too much waste here in the United States 🤧. According to the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/documents/infographic_full-060513_v4.pdf), 267.8 million tons of trash were generated. And even though the US represents 4% of the global population we generate 12% of global municipal solid waste, right behind India and China ( [Verisk Maplecroft, 2019](https://www.maplecroft.com/insights/analysis/us-tops-list-of-countries-fuelling-the-mounting-waste-crisis/)). The trash itself also presents other harmful environmental impacts. US landfills are the 3rd largest source of human-related methane emissions ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas)). Waste also affects 43% of marine mammals ([EPA 2017](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/impacts-mismanaged-trash_.html)).

Waste monitoring systems already exist in commercial settings, ZotBins expands waste monitoring to the individual and community level. Some of these existing systems include [Bigbelly](https://bigbelly.com/), [Compology](https://compology.com/), and [Enevo](https://enevo.com/index.html). ZotBins is completely opensource. Built for people, by people.

## Adafruit IO

This repo, in particular, uses [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/), an off-the-shelf IoT platform. For now, Adafruit IO is a great addition to this project and helps in the following ways:
- 🤗 Helps makes the project more user-friendly (no need to setup your own server, ready to use APIs, Dashboard feature)
- 🆓 Free to use F O R E V E R ╰(*°▽°*)╯ (according to their [website](https://io.adafruit.com/))
- 🤝 Great community on Discord willing to help people out
- 🔒 Data is never [sold](https://www.adafruit.com/iotbor/)

## Getting Started

Follow the [Build Guide](./build_guide.md) 🛠.

## Actionable Ideas for Your Waste Data

Besides just collecting data, here are some ideas that you can implement. Again the goal of this project is to help quantify and promote actionable solutions to reduce waste.

- 🎯 Create a goal to reduce the rate at which you fill up a bin
- 💻 Use the Adafruit IO Integrations (Zapier, IFTTT)
    - Send a summary of weekly fullness rate
    - Send alerts when bin is full
- 🤖 Use machine learning to identify what items are thrown always
    - identify frequently thrown away items then try to reduce that waste (eg. plastic straws are identified frequently in the waste stream, so we can ban the straw or give sustainable alternatives)
    - identify which waste items are incorrectly thrown away

## How this Project Started

This project started at UCI in 2017 with a group of 4 undergraduates for a hackathon hosted by UCI TIPPERS. The aim of the project was to help create a tool to help with UCI's zero waste initiatives. Since then, the project is being shared to the open-source community through ZBCE and the ZotBins UCI undergraduate team continues with new members every year.

You're 2 weeks deep in the semester, the pantry you stocked over the holidays long forgotten and you've been eating DL Chicken for a week now. 

Expirare is a platform where you can find recipes tailored to your pantry!

You can enter all the food you have in your kitchen, with the expiry dates and Expirare will suggest recipes for you to try out!
You can add your own recipes or look at the recipes which use your ingredients from the Edamam API.

Try Expirare for no more food waste!

## Our Vision
According to the National Zero Waste Council's research on household food waste in Canada, almost 2.2 million tonnes of edible food is wasted each year, costing Canadians in excess of [$17 billion](https://www.toronto.ca/services-payments/recycling-organics-garbage/long-term-waste-strategy/waste-reduction/food-waste/). Most of this food is expired and uneaten at all. 

To combat this problem, our team has developed a web application called Expirare. 
## Expirare's Cool Features

### Recipedia Included:
With the Edamam Recipe API, we have over two million recipes from hundreds of websites, each with a detailed nutrition breakdown. 

Have strict diet restrictions or allergies? No problem! With over 80 diet and health filters, you know exactly what you are eating! If you want a more personal touch, we also have hundreds of shared recipes from users all around the globe for you to peruse. 

Running out of ideas to cook is a thing of the past.

### You know KungFU? Show me!
Have some secret recipe from the ancient times? Know some covert ""magic"" to help finish up that carrot? Show us! With a single click, you can share your recipe with users all around the globe, helping them reduce their food waste.

### Due today, cook today:
That tomato is expiring in 1 day? No worries, our web-app prioritizes items that is expiring soonest and give suggestions accordingly. Helping you prioritize those who craves that attention.

## How to run:
For now, to test this application, ensure that you have mongoDB installed on your device to implement a database. 

Clone this Github respository and run `npm i` to install the relevant packages.

Once the packages are installed, run `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js` and open port at localhost:8000 to try out our food saver!

## Future Plans:
We believe that Expirare can thrive with new features. In the future, we have suggestions to improve the applications with new features:

1. Providing analytics of food unused through the use of bar charts and graphs to give the users better awareness of their habits
2. Providing nutritional aid by tracking calories
3. Sending push alerts to the users if they wish, through email and sms

[API-Endpunkt](https://mt183.de/abfallgap/?Ort=Oberammergau&Strasse=Schwedengasse&Hausnummer=12)

## Nutzung

Um die Müllabfuhrtermine für einen Ort abzufragen, sendet man einen GET Request an die selbstgehostete Datei oder den oben geführten Link mit folgenden Parametern:

- Ort: Name des Ortes
- Strasse: Name der Straße  
- Hausnummer: Hausnummer
- Hausnummerzusatz: Zusatz zur Hausnummer (optional)

Beispiel:

```
http://localhost/index.php?Ort=Oberammergau&Strasse=Schwedengasse&Hausnummer=12 
```
Die Antwort enthält ein JSON Objekt mit den Terminen für Restmüll, Gelbe Tonne, Papier, Bio und Sondermüll.

```json

                ""Zeichen"": ""S""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Um zu prüfen, ob an einem bestimmten Tag Müll abgeholt wird, kann man zusätzlich den Parameter `Tag` angeben, mögliche Werte sind Heute, Morgen und ein Datum im Format Y-m-d (2023-12-01):

```
http://localhost/index.php?Ort=Oberammergau&Strasse=Schwedengasse&Hausnummer=12&Tag=2023-10-25
```

Die Antwort enthält dann ein vereinfachtes JSON Objekt mit dem Datum, ob an diesem Tag Müll abgeholt wird sowie Typ und Zeichen falls eine Abholung stattfindet.

```json
{
    ""Daten"": {
        ""Datum"": ""2023-10-25"",
        ""Abfuhr"": true,
        ""Typ"": ""Papier"",
        ""Zeichen"": ""P""
    }
}
```

Bei einem Datum ohne Abholung wird ein `false` in Abfuhr zurückgegeben.

```json
{
    ""Daten"": {
        ""Datum"": ""2023-10-20"",
        ""Abfuhr"": false
    }
}
```

![Pytest passing](https://github.com/xapple/waste_flow/actions/workflows/pytest_master_branch.yml/badge.svg)

# `waste_flow` version 1.3.2

`waste_flow` is a python package for retrieving and analyzing data concerning the waste management of European countries.

<p align=""center"">
<img height=""200"" src=""waste_flow/reports/template/logo.png?raw=true"">
</p>

## Installing

Since `waste_flow` is written in python it is compatible with all operating systems: Linux, macOS and Windows. The only prerequisite is python version 3.9 or above which is often installed by default. Simply choose one of the two following methods to install, depending on which package manager you prefer to use.

### Installing via `conda`

    $ conda install -c conda-forge -c xapple waste_flow

### Installing via `pip`

    $ python3 -m pip install --user waste_flow

### Troubleshooting

* If you do not have `conda` on your system you can refer to [this section](docs/installing_tips.md#installing-python-with-conda).
* If you do not have `pip3` on your system you can refer to [this section](docs/installing_tips.md#obtaining-pip3).
* If you do not have `python3` on your system or have an outdated version, you can refer to [this other section](docs/installing_tips.md#obtaining-python3).
* If none of the above has enabled you to install `waste_flow`, please open an issue on [the bug tracker](https://github.com/xapple/waste_flow/issues), and we will get back to you shortly.

## Usage

Bellow are some examples to illustrate the various ways there are to use this package.

To retrieve the large dataframe with dry mass for all years and all countries you can do the following from your python interpreter:

    >>> from waste_flow.analysis import waste_ana
    >>> print(waste_ana.dry_mass)

If you just want to see how much rubber waste did the UK generate in 2008, you can do the following:

    >>> from waste_flow.generation import waste_gen
    >>> params = (""waste   == 'W073' & ""
    >>>           ""country == 'UK' & ""
    >>>           ""year    == '2008'"")
    >>> result = waste_gen.long_format.query(params)
    >>> print(result)

To create the waste generation plots do the following:

    >>> from waste_flow.viz.gen_by_country import legend
    >>> print(legend.plot(rerun=True))
    >>> from waste_flow.viz.gen_by_country import countries
    >>> for gen_viz in countries.values():
    >>>     print(gen_viz.plot(rerun=True))

## Cache

When you import `waste_flow`, we will check the `$WASTE_FLOW_CACHE` environment variable to see where to download and store the cached data. If this variable is not set, we will default to the platform's temporary directory and clone a repository there. This could result in re-downloading the cache after every reboot.

## Features

The first time you run `waste_flow`, it will automatically download the raw CSVs from the EUROSTAT website to disk and parse the resulting data. On later runs, `waste_flow` will simply retrieve this information directly from the disk. This means that the first time you execute the pipeline things will be noticeably slower: this is normal.

## Source

The two datasets used in this pipeline are available at the following addresses:

* https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wasgen&lang=en

* https://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=env_wastrt&lang=en

These are obtained by starting at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database and following ""Database by themes -> Environment -> Waste -> Waste treatment""

The full name of the datasets are:

* Generation of waste by waste category, hazardousness and NACE Rev. 2 activity (`env_wasgen`).
* Treatment of waste by waste category, hazardousness and waste management operations (`env_wastrt`).

## Customizing

The pipeline is flexible as the user can specify what coefficients they desire or even what custom waste categories they want to create. These input parameters are in the files under the `waste_flow/extra_data_xls` directory.

## Visualizations

The `waste_flow` package can also generate several types of plots that enable the user to compare and visualize the data.

For instance here is a series of graphs comparing the total reported waste generated in wet tonnes between European countries for the *nace* category `C20-C22`.

Questo repository contiene i calendari della SAVNO in formato digitale. Da diversi anni la SAVNO infatti forniva i calendari in formato Excel per permettere l'integrazione con l'app [Raccolta SAVNO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rifiuti.savno).

## Perchè condividere i calendari?

Il supporto all'app è terminato con il 2021. L'app nasce nel 2013 come un progetto a tempo perso e ad uso personale (non mi ricordavo mai di portare fuori la spazzatura!).
Visto l'apprezzamento da parte dei vari utenti, voglio condividere i dati con voi nella speranza di ottenere aiuto nel supporto dell'app o far nascere qualche nuova iniziativa.

## Voglio aiutare a far continuare il progetto. Cosa posso fare?

Puoi aiutare a convertire i file CSV forniti dalla SAVNO Servizi e convertirli nel formato JSON usato dall'app.
Puoi anche donare qualche euro tramite PayPal nel link sulla pagina Facebook [Raccolta SAVNO](https://www.facebook.com/raccoltaSAVNO)

## Voglio inserire i calendari per il mio comune per continuare a usare l'app. Cosa posso fare?

Qui trovi tutti i file CSV con i prelievi 2022. Questi sono i calendari che la SAVNO stessa mi fornisce ogni anno.
Partendo da questi file bisgona generare i file in formato JSON come negli esempi. 

Una volta generati i dati, puoi aprire una pull request o mandarmeli alla mail di Raccolta SAVNO. Se sono corretti li caricherò sul server dell'app.

## E cosa te ne fai delle donazioni ora?
L'importo raccolto dalle donazioni potrà essere usato per beneficenza oppure per ricompensare chi ha convertito i dati. In ogni caso non voglio tenermeli. 

## FAQ

### Perchè hai smesso?

L'inserimento dei calendari avveniva nelle ultime settimane di Dicembre. Dovendo farlo nel mio tempo libero, spess lo facevo a cavallo di Natale e Capodanno. 

In aggiunta durante l'anno dovevo sempre rispondere a mail di supporto o recensioni di utenti spesso infuriati per problemi non dipendenti dall'app. Altre volte erano infuriati giustamente per problemi dell'app.

Ho capito che non riesco a fornire un servizio adeguato. Mi dispiace di non aver interrotto il servizio in un modo migliore.

### Perchè non metti l'app a pagamento?

Non credo tutti siano disposti a pagare per un servizio che già pagano e allo stato attuale non sono interessato a guadagnarci.
Ho provato in passato a chiedere un contributo su PayPal ma l'iniziativa non ha riscosso successo. Se volete donare trovate il link nella pagina Facebook.

### Perchè non chiedi i soldi alla SAVNO per finanziare il progetto?

Il progetto nasce senza fini di lucro. Ci sono stati vari tentativi da ambo le parti di formare una collaborazione ma non siamo mai riusciti a raggiungere un'intesa. Attualmente non sono interessato a farne un'attivita economica e quindi non ha senso parlare di soldi.

La SAVNO sta ora cercando di creare la propria applicazione. Magari qualcosa di buono nasce da tutto questo.

<h4>Scenario</h4>
<p>Waste management is one of the most important problems faced in the today's world. An idea that can provide an effective waste management in the current scenario has become a necessity.<br>
The toxicity due to all types of pollution is a threat to human race. Our product will replace the current outdated waste management systems.</p>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>How might we address waste (including e-waste), handling, storage, transportation, recycling, and final disposal of any residual waste in a uniform way globally such that the developing or poor countries are saved from becoming the dumping ground for the developed countries?</p>
<h4>Our Solution</h4>
<p>Our App features a new waste management system for rapidly growing cities. Instead of waiting for inefficient waste collection systems and unreliable pickup trucks to collect your waste, WRAP lets you request a pickup on-demand with just the tap of a button. WRAP platform is cheaper, efficient, and reliable than local incumbent systems, faster than their service, and Waste collection made easy and fantasized.<br>
Unlike other Waste management platforms, our idea is to spread good environmental habits of sorting and recycling your waste and help you to track your waste and impact
on the environment from your solid waste collection data.<br>
We categorize the collected waste according to our waste grading system and rewards with WRAP coins. They can be used to claim various deals and vouchers on our partner
websites. This would encourage the users to manipulate the recyclables properly. We are launching ""WRAP"", a web application that collect your recyclables and provides you with rewards for them</p>

### Description
**TrashMe** is a website that helps college students understand the trash items they usually throw away, and learn how to properly dispose the components based on categories. TrashMe is built using React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, deployed using Microsoft Azure, and based on the wireframes developed in Figma.

### Inspiration

Have you ever wondered whether you should throw your cupcake in a paper cup in the food bin or recycle bin? You see multiple colored trash bins but have no idea what each of them is used for throwing that trash and where the trash goes at the end. As international students and avid environmental lovers, we always struggled with this basic information about waste management when we first came to the US. Hence, we bring our app ""TrashMe"" which would be able to create awareness, guide users, make the process easier for them to manage their waste properly, and help the environment and us.

### Web Evaluation

- **Category:** Environmental awareness, Sustainability, Waste Management, Life Style
- **Web:** Web appication (first experience), may develop mobile application further
- **Story:** User can scroll through the trash list thrown by college students and also categories of different trashes. They can search  a particular trash. On clicking to that particular one, user would be able to see the category of the particular trash. User on clicking the category would get the information of where they should be throwing the trash or how they would be managing the waste they make.
- **Market:** Anyone who is an international student or a cllege student who isn't known about the composting or 3R techniques of waste management in the US would be able to use it to get the inforation and manage their trash in a right way. They can even see the most thrown wastes by students and be aware to decrease the waste they might make as a student.
- **Habit:** User can search throughout the day as many times as they would like to get the information. As people would be making waste in every aspect, they would be able to get the information for the right way to manage their waste in those moments.
- **Scope:** We will start with list of the trashes, most thrown trash, their categories, search bar to search them for making it user-friendly, and method of their management.


## Product Spec

### 1. What users can do in this app.

**Required Must-have Stories**

- [x] User can tap into the items page that is embedded in the main home page.
- [x] User can see the search bar where they can search for the particular trash.
- [x] User can tap in a particular item in items page and see their categories too.
- [x] User on clicking in a category would see the image on where it should be thrown and the information on whether it should be recycled or thrown to be compost etc.


**Planned future features**
* Launch a mobile application.
* User can create their own account.
* User can see the most searched trash on their account as a record.
* User can see a different category section for the wastes.
* User can read news articles about sustainability and waste management.

### How we built it

**We used the following technologies:**

- React.js, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Azure, Figma

1) We hard-coded our own datasets required for the project by researching different governmental papers and databases.
2) We took an online course on developing web applications using React as we had never used it before.
3) We did extensive research for designing the front end and deploying the application in Azure.

**Frontend Design** We used Miro Board to make our rough sketch first and used Figma to visualize the design of the website. Finally, we decorated our structured website incorporating React while using CSS. 

### Challenges we faced
1) Implementing Lottiefiles as a button on the Launch Page => found an alternative to that later; using gif instead
2) Merge conflicts in GitHub => solved them successfully
3) Linking one webpage to another page => succeeded in that with the mentor's help
4) Showing more than one category for a single waste item => dived deep to understand the logic and implemented it.
5) How to show information details in a consistent and organized way for all of the different trash items on the main page.


### What we learned and are proud of

1) Creating a working website with HTML, CSS, and React
2) Implementing a search bar
3) Deploying web application using Azure
4) Coding in a collaborative manner using Git
5) Trial and error in figuring out the first stages of the web app.

– Let's talk about **TECH-DEBT**  
– That thing again? **WHY?!**  

Do you find yourself in this conversation? (－‸ლ) **EXACTLY!**  

<img src=""assets/frustrated.png"" />

Unfortunately, we tend to adapt to discomfort and, without finding a solution to a chronic pain, we end up ignoring the ringing alarm for good.  

I've seen this repeating pattern many times in my career, especially when dealing with TECH-DEBT, so I started working backwards trying to understand why this is still an issue; after so many years.

Let's start with some history first.

## The ""discovery""

It's hard to talk in terms of ""world wide software industry"" before the early 90's if we consider ""industry"" as a production system for a large [consumer base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_base) (**Microsoft Windows** was released on [November, 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft#1985%E2%80%931994:_Windows_and_Office) and **Classic Mac OS** in [January, 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS)) but still, at that time, a lot of amazing high-level programming languages like COBOL or Fortran were already there—for decades—and many genius minds were around and thinking how to make things better; and they already had a clear understanding of the consequences of producing **""not-quite-right-code""**.

## The Metaphor

In 1992 the outstanding [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) used the analogy of a financial [debt](http://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html) to refer to that **""not-quite-right-code""** (you can see [his 5' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqeJFYwnkjE) too)

## The adoption

It took some time, but, by the first decade of the 21st century the whole software engineering community adopted the term, the metaphor and the idea behind the words, building different strategies and protocols around the **debt-acquisition** and **debt-payment** dynamics. But yet, we're still here talking about that; frustrated and uncomfortable with the whole thing. **THERE is were I stopped and detected a glitch**.

## The Mind Glitch

The metaphor was adopted at a great cost, **simply because we're all biased when it comes to financial debt**, the ""debt"" **signifier** is quiet innocuous but the **signified** is a dark universe! ([signifier/signified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Course_in_General_Linguistics))

1. Being in debt is something we avoid
2. Owing money is scary
3. Making a client owe money feels WRONG
4. We shouldn’t be leaking our client’s pocket
5. Hiding a small money leak is easy until it isn’t, but it might be somebody else's problem by then. (pass–the–buck factor)
6. No one wants to pay for somebody else’s debts!

And it wasn't Cunningham's fault, it was ours, we, individually, introduced the signified bug and covered the **""not-quite-right-code""** thing with such a negative aura that it makes us struggle to think clearly on the problem.

## The Mind Shift

The first thing I do when I feel lost is to calm down and look around to find some reference points. Going back to the ""manufacturing"", ""industry"" and ""not-quite-right-thing"" we can find some ""intersections"".

![Timber](assets/timber.png)
*Photo by [Alexander Andrews](https://unsplash.com/photos/c91LS-JK7cw) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)*

Every industry produces ""not-quite-right-stuff"" along with ""the-right-stuff"" and the term is **industrial waste**; it can be environmentally friendly, recyclable, sellable, lightly toxic or extremely poisonous and radioactive but they all generate some kind of sub-product during the manufacturing process and they all had to learn to deal with it, in most cases regulated by law.  

![Mining](assets/mining.png)
*Photo by [Michal Pech](https://unsplash.com/photos/xS5bOLKCSLw) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)*

At this point it becomes crystal clear that **the natural sub-product of the software industry IS TECH-DEBT**.  

The [TTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_market) has mutated from a per-year basis to a per-sprint one; the technology also evolves at a thrilling pace, all this means that we're producing an incredible amount of waste. Blame the market, the managers, FOMO related to tech trends, but even if I produce the best code today, tomorrow it might be legacy/incorrect/deprecated and that's just for the green field; we're not even including existing legacy code in the equation.

Our work permeates almost everything around us, from the most trivial mobile app and up to medical devices, transportation and aerospace industries; this is a huge responsibility, so being systematic and thoughtful on how we prepare our work to be easy to maintain and fix, will make the difference between a bad day and a life.

## The Plan

So now what? We detected a glitch but what can we do about it?  

**BE INTENTIONAL**  

By intentional I mean to do something about it every day through a strict plan. The plan is defined by **9 sustainment principles** which are both **independent** and **interrelated**.

- **Operational Cycle**
  - Preparation
    - [1. Analysis](#1-analysis)
    - [2. Knowledge Base](#2-knowledge-base)
    - [3. Tooling](#3-tooling)
  - Execution
    - [4. Collection](#4-collection)
    - [5. Distribution](#5-distribution)
    - [6. Processing](#6-processing)
- **Strategic Cycle**
  - Leading
    - [7. Prevention](#7-prevention)
    - [8. Audit](#8-audit)
    - [9. R&D](#9-rd)

![Operational Cycle](assets/operational_cycle.png)

### Preparation

Every output here should be designed to iteratively improve the [execution](#execution) group.

#### 1. Analysis

**Code Analysis** can be done manually, through developer tools or through automated tools, but all existing code—old or new—should be analyzed. An iterative process must be defined and followed by every team and the output captured in a backlog.

**Metrics** will be highly affected by the development process and the technologies involved, but metrics are the key to understand the big picture in many ways, e.g.—at a high level—if you divide `(total commits / bug-fix commits) * 100` you'll obtain a defect commit rate percentage. Many insightful numbers can be obtained through metrics, but of course, to have metrics you have to generate them somehow. If you're not sure about what to measure, just start measuring something, the ideas may come together with the numbers.

#### 2. Knowledge Base

There's no point for Analysis if it's not captured in a knowledge base, **a project MUST have a wiki**.

Unless captured at company level, **design and write down protocols** for common tasks in a concise way, too many or too few rules will tend to produce more mistakes during execution.

#### 3. Tooling

The result of analysis and knowledge base should **produce some kind of tooling**. These tools can be designed to assist stepin 1 and 2 or to assist in step 4. Be intentional on investing time and resources to build  hight quality tools for the ""manufacturing"" process.

### Execution

Every output here should be designed to iteratively plan and manufacture the product.

#### 4. Collection

All insights produced during preparation **should be collected, sorted, validated and organized in a backlog**. An empty or inexistent tech-debt backlog is a big sign of waste accumulation.

Organize your backlog as an **intentional data-oriented source of information**, you'll have to see the numbers to make better decisions on each step of the cycle.

#### 5. Distribution

Here's where your **sprint/quarter planning** shines, you have the analysis, the protocols, the tools and the material; plan around it all, allocate time and resources and distribute the work, pursuing constant improvement instead of instant perfection.

**Generate and use metrics** for this so to share the tech-debt processing tasks in a sustainable way for your people and your business. This shouldn't create tension or burn out anybody but it has to be constantly captured as part of the daily work of a team.

#### 6. Processing

And here's where **all the previous work collapses into a concrete code** action by being recycled—if useful for other purposes—refactored, fixed, deprecated or disposed, and **annotations get added for the next cycle**.

Also here, **metrics** can be extremely useful. How much code needed to be refactored, fixed or deprecated? Why? Was it old or a recently created code?

![Strategic Cycle](assets/strategic_cycle.png)

### Leading

[Preparation](#preparation) and [Execution](#execution) groups tend to be incremental, linear and continuous; **leading** is meant to be **exponential**. If a jump is possible we'll see it here.

#### 7. Prevention

As in every industry, minimizing waste production during manufacturing is a game changer. The prevention principle is **interrelated** with the [Execution](#execution) area of the life-cycle.

#### 8. Audit

- Train specialists
- Audit the code AND the processes
- Get metrics

The auditing activity is **interrelated** with the [Preparation](#preparation) area of the life-cycle.

#### 9. R&D

- Can we produce less waste?
- Can all this framework be replicable?
- Can this be abstracted as a standard?
- Can we design general purpose tools for all our projects?
- Can we productize something?

The R&D activity affects both the [Preparation](#preparation) and the [Execution](#execution) areas of the life-cycle.

## TL;DR

- Tech-debt is not a bad thing ""per se"", **the bad thing is the ""un"" factor**
  - Un-known
  - Un-wanted
  - Un-tracked
  - Un-intentional
  - Un-planned
  - Un-handled
- **Bug fixing and security are commonly related to tech-debt** but that's **not a [""sine qua non""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_qua_non) condition**. Having separated backlogs or tags for bug fixing, security and technical debt is a good idea and the more data-oriented and granular the backlog is, the easier to analyzing the data will be.
- **The plan can be applied retrospectively** with great benefits, start analyzing, tagging and organizing your old backlog thinking about tech-debt and crunch some numbers; you'll be surprised.

### Closing notes

A lot of work is still required, each principle should be refined along with the concrete tasks, but the high level definition is clear.

## HACKTABLE 2021

## INSPIRATION
Inspired from the sustainablity I follow up in my life to reduce the ecological footprint and plastic as much as I could.

## MY PROJECT
This project spreads up the awareness and educate the upcoming generations about environmental issues and climatic changes in engaging way. It's basically a game where the trash is been thrown away by the consumers on roads. Here, we as a responsible citizen thriving for a sustainable earth filter out the trash into compost and recycle bins using appropriate keys. It keep track of the points and updates us with the scores simultaneously. This would definitely put individuals on work in gaining wisdom about saving our mother nature from all the malpractises.

Youtube Link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trRKaLj0BN8

## HOW I BUILT IT
I had built it using python including libraries needed and as well had imported assets and sounds to make it more functional and realistic. I had used various classes and functions to call all the objects at right point of time in games functionality. The main file consists of all basic inputs along with user friendly GUI and activated operations for enabled buttons. The score tracking is embedded along with 'p' for pause and 'g' for go. Along with it, I had used 'a' and 'd' keys for compost bins, 'right' and 'left' arrow keys for recycle bin. It's a realistic challenge and can't wait to see judges enjoy this hack. I reason I choose this is to make hackathon fun and also address the pressing issue of the decade. Totally loved building this hack. 

## CHALLENGES FACED
The main challenge was to get all the functionalities right and overcome hell lot of bugs which was indeed daunting. Other troube I had faced is trash stopping abruptly in the middle of the game. I gave my most of the time in solving these issues and got frantic of if I could submit the project on time.

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS
I am proud of what I had accomplished. Contributing a hack to address a well needed environmental issue was exciting to indulge with. Hope that day comes off soon, where plastic is completely banned from usage. Literally, I had to multitask across various other works and squeeze up the best possible time to make this project as pleasing as it can get.

## WHAT I HAD LEARNT
Learnt using python libraries and applying the functionalities and all intregating all the assets and related classes to show up and activate at right point of time when game is running. It was a wonderful learning weekend.

## FUTURE OF GARBAGE FILTER
I would add up more functionalities to make this hack versatile.

44,WasteNet,sleepingcat4,N/A,https://github.com/sleepingcat4/WasteNet,https://api.github.com/repos/sleepingcat4/WasteNet,Re-creating UK's leading Waste Classification Algorithm,"Repository contains code to implement Uk government’s leading Waste classification Algorithm. The code for the published paper was not available neither any explicit instructions except for the methodology and novel approach that they took. 

## Introduction


WasteNet shows superior capability in classifying images over previously known pre-trained models such as ResNet-50, AlexNet and DenseNet. It uses a novel technique proposed by the authors of the paper i.e. Hybrid Tuning that leverages both feature extraction and fine-tuning. 

A approach known as discriminative learning was used to prevent “catastrophic forgetting” and overall generalise the dataset and convergence. 

## Dataset

WasteNet was originally trained on trashnet dataset which was open sourced by Stanford University. It contains 2533 images of waste in 6 different categories. 

## Data Augmentation


Originally several data augmentation techniques were used on the dataset before feeding the final version of the dataset. But, in our research and implementation of the paper, we focused more on the Model’s Architecture and achieving a good overall score. 

## File-structure
Augmentation contains a python function to augment your dataset as per mentioned in the original paper. model.py & train.py respectively contain the model architecture and training code for training it on CIFAR-10 dataset. 

## Training

In our training, we assumed the hyperparameters since it was not explicitly mentioned in the paper, and trained the model for 20 epochs. Though the original paper trains the model for 1000 epochs to achieve convergence and 97% accuracy. Highest known till date. 

## Development

The Model and paper is still under-development. Though we have already implemented the original model architecture as mentioned in the WasteNet paper, we are thinking of changing a few lines and features of our own and adding some. We’ll continue to update the code. 

## Licence

This repository falls under a modified MIT Licence, which means you can’t sublicense/sell the software/algorithm/artificial intelligence written in this repository without the explicit permission from **sleepingcat**. And the code in this repository can only be used for research purposes strictly.

An exploration of using open-source hardware &amp; software to democratize waste recycling and processing  

![](images/multi-spectral-ros-nodes.jpg)  

![](images/multi-spectral/all-channels.jpg)

Each year humans collectively dump over 2 billion tons of waste and are on track to over 3.4 billion tons/ year by 2050. Currently this directly affects over 61 million people, and amounts to approximately 5% of greenhouse gas emissions.

Almost half of all wastage is food waste, of which 40% is wasted at retail and consumer levels due to an over-emphasis on appearance in quality standards. Despite such a large quantity of waste coming from food, only a small portion of this is composted (when food waste is placed in landfill it produces methane rather than CO2, see [compost vs landfill](https://recycle.com/organics-compost-vs-landfill/)). In addition many methods for up-cycling food wastage simply aren't implemented either due to increased cost of manual labor, or lack of adoption industry wide.

The evolution of single-stream recycling has resulted in increased recycling rates, as consumers don't have to do the sorting manually, and reduces cost for recycling plants (only one collection system). However, it has also lead to a decrease in the quality of materials recovered due to increased contamination from non-approved materials or unclean recyclables (it is generally to expensive for a recycling plant to clean recyclables) being placed in single stream bins.

Over the past few years with the rise of AI on the edge and IoT a number of new products have been in development to help combat the waste issue. Some of these include Alphabets X's Everyday Robot, Tomra's Container Deposit, and 'smart bins' that sort what goes into them. While these products are slowly to help combat some of these issues, adoption can be slow and costly.

This project will showcase some methodologies and processes for the development of a low-cost open-source waste management system, opening possibilities for democratizing the recycling industry. While this isn't an end-to-end project and demonstration (due to limitations in resources), it will discuss the components required in classifying waste types and proposed methodologies for dealing with them.

Waste separation is an important step in the recycling process to preserve the environment.
In this project we sort waste using a camera avec a Convolutional Neural Network.
## Idea
The idea is to build a **vision-based waste sorting machine**.
This machine consists of:
* A treadmill (tapis roulant);
* A camera;
* A robot arm (bras robot);
* A computer with a GPU graphics card for image processing.

## Summary
Use a scale built into a garbage truck to measure the net weight of residual and organic waste bins (both 140 L by default, 240 L optionally at no extra fixed cost), which are collected weekly by default or optionally fortnightly. Note that residual waste may also be known as general waste, which is typically sent to landfill in Australia. Charge the rate payer on a per kg basis for this waste (e.g. 60 c/kg AUD and 20 c/kg, respectively), with an optional free service of 9 recyclable fractions in 100 L sacks, collected monthly or bimonthly. Fixed costs of equipment and collection would ideally be subsidized by federal or state funding and thus by taxes in order to deliver public benefits. However, where such subsidization is not provided, fixes fees, e.g. per pickup or per annum, may be necessary, but would increase the amount of residual waste if the price per kg is reduced. Such a scheme has been demonstrated successfully in Bjuv, Sweden, with similar weight-based pricing schemes in Denmark, Germany and Ireland. Other improvements include:
- promoting reusable/washable and/or biodegradable products such as for nappies and dialysis sacs (with which the non-biodegradable and/or disposable and non-washable forms tend to produce a lot of waste and may be financially disadvantageous to users of these products);
- cleaning up any dumped waste, although it may not actually increase after a year, as was found in Bjuv in Sweden, coupled with monitoring e.g. via [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/) and fines;
- possibly using transparent bins to make incorrectly sorted waste more visible, and education such as stickers, flyers, and talking to people to reduce incorrectly sorted waste. Fines could be used as a last resort.
- mechanical locked gate systems or systems like the Identify, Press, Weight (IPW) Centre may be preferable for
high-density apartments;
- Using cryptographic, scalable, public database systems such as [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) would have
benefits such as transparency, auditability, benefits of open data and open source software, and ease of scaling
the software to other demonstrations of a Bjuv-like weight-based residual, compost and 9 recyclable fractions scheme.

## Abstract
Weight-based schemes have been implemented successfully in Denmark, Sweden and Germany
in tandem with multiple fractions of waste collection streams.
Incentivizing Waste Reduction (IWR) / WasteLess proposes to extend such schemes to more local councils,
with an initial focus on councils in the Greater Sydney metropolitan region, Australia.
The scheme involves using a scale to measure the net weight of a general waste bin,
and charge the bin's rate payer on a per kg basis for this waste, in order to incentivize waste reduction, with some other improvements and considerations. Benefits include fairer pricing of waste, and when likely reducing waste substantially due to incentivization, benefits extend to less landfill (the proposal could even be extended to the public being incentivized to remove waste from landfill), reduced greenhouse emissions (particularly from methane), reuse/recycling of resources (which is particularly important for non-renewable resources), and a more sustainable society. The scale can be mounted in a garbage truck, or a portable one could be used e.g. with garbage loader crews. The latter method would be better suited for rear and front loaders rather than automated side loaders) and would be less efficient, less capital-intensive, and more labour-intensive, but may be worth considering for developing countries. Bins could be locked to prevent dumping in others' bins, and unlocked efficiently with Bluetooth technology. Cryptographic database systems like [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) could be used for transparency, auditability, scalability, security, etc., while the data could also be used (after being anonymised and aggregated) to get insights into trends of waste with location and demographics, which could in turn be useful e.g. for more targeted education programs to reduce waste. The technology works best in tandem with multiple specialized waste collection bins, such as for recycling, organics, and recyclable soft plastics such as those found in [Redcycle](https://www.redcycle.net.au/) bins. To prevent illegal dumping and putting waste into the wrong bins (e.g. putting non-biodegradable plastic bags into an organics bin), bins could be made transparent, and the scheme would work better with other initiatives such as monitoring, reporting and cleanup technology like [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/), as well as re-investing some of the funds generated from the scheme into cleaning up illegally dumped waste. Compassionate treatment of financially disadvantaged people is needed to ensure that they are not worse off with this scheme, such as ratepayer government assistance, coupled with other assistance to help them that is beyond the scope of this proposal.

proposal well. The seed idea was first expressed
[here on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JamesCRay01/status/936992945173020672),
however the below information
should be more detailed.

## The Problem / Challenge:

In this section, please be prepared to explain what specific challenges you
wish to address.

#### What type of social or governance challenge are you addressing? *
- [ ] Corruption
- [ ] Economic Opportunity
- [ ] Property Rights
- [ ] Strengthening Civil Society
- [ ] Supply Chain Tracking
- [ ] Voting
- [ ] Financial Transaction
- [x] Other: Waste management and associated effects of waste, including
methane emissions, resource depletion, toxicity impacts in land, water and air;
and impacts on birds, aquatic life,
and other biota.

#### Are there specific aspects of the problem that you want to see addressed? *

My idea involves addressing the problem of incentivizing waste reduction,
i.e. addressing a lack of sufficient incentives for reducing waste.

#### Is this problem currently being addressed? If so, in what ways and to what degree of success? *

I don't think it is being addressed well because councils generally charge a
flat rate for collection. Some councils provide options of different bin
sizes, but still charge a flat rate per week in proportion to the bin's
capacity.

The problem has been addressed in rural municipalities in Denmark, in
cities in Germany, and
in Sweden [[1](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].

##### Denmark

A weight-based kerbside collection scheme as used in
Danish municipalities would work best for single-unit dwellings, while refer
to the German projects in cities below for multiple-unit dwellings.

In Denmark, residents may request an electronic lock
for their bin, but few have been
requested [[1, p. 16](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
However, if this scheme was implemented in metropolitan areas,
more locks may be requested.

Denmark has a fixed and variable portions for their scheme.
""However, the fee varies from 594–1,066 DKK [127–229 AUD]
per household
per year [this appears to be referring to the fixed fee,
since the fixed fee in the Bogense municipality is 1,063 DKK
per household per year] between the municipalities, depending on the service
level in general, the quantity of waste effectively covered
by the fixed element of the overall fee, and the fee for the
waste exceeding the fixed waste quantity. In the municipality
of Bogense the fee for waste collection consists of a fixed
yearly fee and a variable weight-based fee…
The fixed fee for households covers 5 kg waste per collection…
The variable, weight-dependent fee is paid per kg waste
(i.e. residual and organic waste) above the 5 kg figure."" [[1, p. 16
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
The variable fee in Bogense, 2000, is 3.75 DKK per kg organic/residual waste
(this applies to waste over the 5 kg limit). [[1, p. 16
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
The study compared two Danish municipalities, Bogense and Oelstykke,
with and without the weight-based scheme, respectively,
found that Bogense was cheaper, even with a four-person household,
but noting that the fee in Oelstykke is above average for Danish municipalities,
and also noting that ""The municipality of Bogense uses e.g. approximately 960 hours
per year for administration compared to approximately 860 hours per year in the
municipality of Oelstykke.""

The study found that the weight-based scheme reduced waste:
""On average, the amount of waste collected in municipalities
with weight-based schemes is 359 kg less per household compared
to municipalities withoutweight-based schemes. Taking composting
in private gardens into account,the difference is estimated as
279 kg per household."" [[1, p. 18
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]

Furthermore: ""A significant increase in the amount of paper and cardboard
collected has been registered compared to municipalities without
this scheme. However, the amount of glass collected is almost similar.""
[[1, p. 18
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
The finding on glass may be because glass has to be ""taken to
central containers… or to the municipal recycling station"",
in Bogense, an inconvenience. [[1, p. 15
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
This may be because glass tends to reduce the economic
viability of waste collection [[2](
https://www.waste360.com/glass/focusing-economics-glass-recycling)].

The study also noted a higher degree of home composting was likely,
economic benefits for sorting/recycling,
and disadvantages including dumping, burning of waste (which
may have health impacts), no solidarity to households with
high amounts of waste e.g. families with babies, and
heavy administration [[1, p. 19–21
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
As noted elsewhere in this proposal,
potential resolutions for dumping including monitoring
with CleanApp and funding from fines,
the scheme and/or tax, although the study
notes that the dumping ""was especially a problem in the beginning when the
scheme was introduced, and in some of the municipalities, the dumping of waste
at lay-bys has fallen back to the initial level"" [[1, p. 21
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]. Burning of waste is
difficult to negate, because it can be
done privately in one's own home,
but education about the impacts on
air quality, the environment, and
health would help to reduce this.
Administration can be reduced through the use of
IT, as discussed elsewhere in this proposal,
or if necessary funded through the scheme
(which is cheaper than the traditional one). The study also noted that
families with babies can use reusuable diapers, and this alternative can be
promoted [[1, p. 21
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].

The study noted that the scheme should only be implemented
in municipalities where the environmental consciousness/
duty/stewardship is relatively high, otherwise it would be more economical to
first concentrate on ""information campaigns where the citizens are given
instructions on sorting and recycling of waste (with weight-based schemes
introduced subsequently)"" [[1, p. 22
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
At any rate, it may be best practice to have at least an information campaign,
before implementing a scheme in a municipality, regardless of how well environmentally-
dutiful citizens may be.

##### Germany: Weight and volume-based systems at apartment blocks

The study notes various problems for a weight-based system for multiple-unit
dwellings, including where tenants reside [[1, p. 23
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
It examines the results of an Identify, Press, Weight (IPW) Centre [[1, p. 23–26
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
and a
simple mechanical lock gate system, using a chip card [[1, p. 26–29
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
(a tap and pay
card would be more efficient, but note the fraud concerns outlined below—CTRL+F
""debit card"", which should nevertheless be manageable by not using debit cards.)

##### Sweden
Since the year 2000, the Swedish munipality of Bjuv, consisting
of single- and multiple-unit residences, has had 11 fractions for waste
with a weight-based scheme: ""kerbside collection of residual waste, organic
waste, newspapers, 6 fractions of packaging waste (cardboard, hard and soft
plastics, coloured and uncoloured glass, metals), and an option for kerbside
collection of garden waste"" [[1, p. 43 or 54 of 143 in the PDF)
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
Variables fees apply for residual and organic waste (3.65 SEK/kg and 1.2
SEK/kg, or ~0.56 AUD/kg and ~0.18 AUD/kg, respectively,
ignoring inflation and forex fluctations), plus a fixed fee for residual
waste (560 SEK/annum, ~86 AUD/a).

""An on-vehicle weighing system is used. Containers are tagged with an
intelligent chip (to avoid switching, voluntary or involuntary, between
neighbours) and weighed both before and after emptying. The difference in
weight is the basis for the charge to the household… This change led to the
cost for the waste collection system almost doubling.""  [[1, p. 44
](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)].
in this proposal, to measure the weight of the bin after emptying it,
and deduct the weight of a bin to obtain the net weight.

Collection intervals are every week or fortnight for residual waste and
compostable waste; 12 times/annum for newspaper, cardboard, and hard
plastics; and 6 times/a for coloured and uncoloured glass, and soft plastics.
140 L bins are provided for residual waste, with a 240 L bin available at no
extra fixed cost, and a 140 L container for compostable waste.

Dramatic improvements resulted in Bjuv from this scheme: in the first two years,
the total waste was reduced by 30%, residual waste reduced by more than 70%,
and recycled fractions increased by 130%. [[1, p. 44–45](
http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/financingmuncipalwaste_management.pdf)]
There was no observable increase in litter. 62 tonnes of dumped waste was collected
in 2001, compared to total waste in the municipality of 3 kilotonnes (p. 46).
The implementation for apartment blocks was no more difficult than for detached
houses, but this may be different for urban areas.

As noted on this page, it had been difficult to balance the budget, since
residual waste (which provides most of the
revenue) was reduced more than expected, but this can be offset by a higher
fixed fee, which was subsequently planned, while also reducing the variable
fee, which was also also planned.

The study noted that if replicating the scheme in Bjuv, costs would rise
considerably, especially if there are not as many alternative collection fractions
as in Bjuv (the cost of the equipment doubled in Bjuv).

### Ireland
Some notes / key findings on [3](
http://www.regions4recycling.eu/upload/public/Good-Practices/GP_Limerick_Pay-per-Weight-system-SWR.pdf):
""The study concluded that weight-based charges are the single most effective PBU system in terms of waste prevention, waste recycling and diversion of waste from landfill. These charges prompted the highest per household recycling levels (between 27% and 32%), highest  diversion rates  from landfill (between 28% and 35%) and the lowest total kerbside waste figures (between 800kg and 947kg per annum). The study projected that if the estimated 80% of those households across Ireland currently on pay per lift / tags and differential bin systems switched to ‘per kg’ based PBU system, it could lead to an annual diversion from landfill of approximately 446,000 tonnes of domestic waste per annum.""—p. 6

Annual charges and per-lift charges are important to account for the cost of transport and labour. P. 10 highlights the
importance of a federally-led scheme, even if it is initially in a trial area, e.g. for preparing national legislation, strategy, coordination, education; as well as the responsibilities of the other organisations involved. It's best to read the paper directly.

The use of permits with the same conditions for private waste collectors ensure that ""there was no competitive advantage for operators operatingin areas with less onerous requirements"" (p. 11). However, waste collection in Ireland is financed mainly by the private sector, while in Australia it is financed by councils, with some subcontracting to private waste collectors (p. 11).

> A regulatory impact assessment undertaken by the DoECLG recognised the cost to industry in moving over to a pay by weight system, but, on the basis of the findings of the STRIVE research Study, asserted that ""A  transition  to  weight  based  charging  on  a  national  basis  could  be achieved relatively cheaply, in view of the potential benefits."" The  exact  investment  costs,  running  costs  and  savings  are  not  available  as  this  information  is commercially sensitive.

From the lessons learnt on p. 15, householders being able to switch between collectors that have
lower weight-based fees was a countermeasure against
actually reducing their waste, but this isn't really applicable in an
Australian residential context; as is the case
for
other problems with multiple collectors being available to households.

##### Australia

Quotes from [4](https://blog.mraconsulting.com.au/2015/08/03/weight-based-charging-the-sleeping-giant-stirs/)
> The key barrier is weighing technology on trucks that can meet the exacting standards of the National Measurement Institute (NMI), which is the regulator of weighing systems. All weight based transactions in Australia must be made on scales which have been “Approved for Trade” by NMI…
> Tony Khoury summarised the practical limitations of some weighing systems and commented that the systems needed to work consistently and robustly. It is no good if the systems do not work on wet days, sloping ground etc. It would do nothing to prevent overflowing bins or litter…

> - All systems that use scales to charge clients must be “Approved for Trade” by NMI;
> - Any private agreements based on weights, need to comply with the National Measurement legislation administered by NMI;
> - There is one accredited WBC system available and others in the process of being submitted to the NMI; and
> - The NMI would be working more closely with the waste sector on WBC weighing systems (but also on the accuracy of existing bin volumes and liquid waste volume measurements).

### Other remarks
Weight-based charging for residual and compostable
has been found to have some elasticity [6](
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928765516000269).
While higher fixed fees and lower weight-based fees may
help to recover costs of equipment and collection,
waste would increase proportionally with lower weight-based fees.
Therefore, subsidizing the cost of waste collection services,
e.g. via taxes, may be desirable for public benefits.
However, where there is insufficient for political will
to achieve this, having a standing charge / fixed fee
to cover the cost of transport, lift and equipment may
be the next most preferable option.

## The Solution and Technology

In this section, please be prepared to explain your pilot proposal in depth.

We will need to understand how your idea seeks to incorporate blockchain
technology to solve the problem(s) you described above.

#### Describe your solution. How can blockchain technology address the problem? *
Charge rate payers for the amount of mass that they add to general waste bins, e.g. by
having a weight machine built-in to garbage trucks, and/or into each general waste bin, or
measured by a portable scale used by garbage collection staff (this would work
for rear-loaders or front-loaders, but would be more labour intensive than the other two options).
A scale in each bin would be more expensive but scales aren't expensive,
and would allow for bin users to verify that the amounts measured and recorded
on their accounts are correct, like with water and electricity meters.

Which leads to other interesting ideas such as waste trading and markets
for waste (like with energy trading and markets projects like Grid+ and
Power Ledger). Got a full bin? No worries, just ask a neighbour in person
or via the dapp to use their bin, and pay them for it.

Scalable, distributed app frameworks
like
[Holochain](https://holochain.org) could be used to make the data transparent
and the app scalable and decentralised.

If there are dedicated bins for recycling (even for particular recyclable
materials like bins for glass, paper and cardboard, metals, soft plastics
and hard plastics), garden waste, and food waste (which
there should be, and this program should ideally only be implemented with
these), then there is no charge for using these. That way, people are
not only incentivized to reduce waste but it is more convenient to do so
and divert it to recycle or convert to other useful materials/products.
For instance, people in high-rise units don't have to use a worm farm
or bokashi bin to handle organic waste, or use a compost bin in houses
or boutique apartments.
Ideally, soft plastics that
are recyclable in [Redcycle](https://www.redcycle.net.au/)
bins would also be collected in kerbside bins,
since this would result in more soft plastics being recycled, due to convenience.
(I recycle soft plastics in Redcycle bins, but not everyone knows about them,
or can't be bothered to use them.) Note that rewarding users for
these bins would incentivize excess consumption,
or collecting biomass from forest to put in their own green waste bin,
both of which would be perverse behaviours and outcomes.
Others benefit from
the resources collected in these bins, so any cost to use these bins, if any,
should be discounted to account for such external benefits.

However, it should be noted that this technology, if not used with all the
above bins and collections of each of them, would add pressure on councils
to do so, since ratepayers would be more incentivized to reduce waste,
and thus pressure/lobby councils to invest in bins and collecting for
recycling, garden waste and organics (which can be collected together,
although collecting garden waste has been done more), soft recyclable
plastics as is done with Redcycle but not kerbside recycling, e-waste,
etc., or other technologies. While this may be an inconvenient consequence
for potential clients of this technology, councils, it would be a good
outcome for the environment and ratepayers' pockets. Additionally,
given that China is not accepting some post-consumer recycled materials,
there is an extra burden on councils from a local to federal level to
manage waste.

The truck follows a route,
and so can log the address of the house for each new bin unloaded into the
truck, with the additional weight measured. Coordinates of the truck via
GPS and mobile data
and the timestamp at the time of loading a bin
can also be
used as an extra verification. The accuracy of the weight machine
should probably be no more than 1 gram. Using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)
to store this data has
benefits including transparency, auditability, censorship-resistance, and
better scalability to different councils worldwide. Making the DLT
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has
benefits including auditability and better ability to improve it or adapt it
for other projects.

The project can be adapted for stationary public bins, etc., by having an
interface that involves needing to pay to use the bin, but this would be more
complex, and would need to be not much more inconvenient than putting waste in
a bin. E.g. put it on a weight balance externally on the bin, tap a card to
pay, put it in the bin. Even this would probably be too inconvenient, however.

People who waste less, pay less, and people who waste more are incentivized to
waste less, or the funds collected can be spent on better waste management
technology and outreach/education/raising of awareness.

As described below, bins should be locked to prevent dumping in others bins,
and should be unlocked by trucks and users with Bluetooth technology for
efficiency.

#### Who are the actors involved/who is impacted by this pilot? *
Everyone that puts waste in bins and is involved with waste,
or affected by it, which is really everyone and everything on this
Earth.

#### How many people would your solution be helping? *

Again, all biota. This is due to the far-reaching impacts of
reducing greenhouse gases such as methane, as well as reducing
resource depletion (e.g. petrochemically-derived products and associated
greenhouse gas emissions). While other effects can be more local,
such as leaching of chemicals into the land, water, and air
(note that of the air, this is
particularly due to the incineration of plastics), they can also still
have far-reaching impacts. Also, once waste enters oceans (outside of
EEZs), due to
oceans being a public commons, management of such waste becomes
a global problem.

Another benefit is that the data collected
could have broader uses
and help to understand waste trends by area, etc.
Users should have their data anonymised and aggregated by default,
unless they wish to opt out of doing so. Holochain and other
blockchains provide the ability to have anonymous accounts,
although it is possible for governments to identify accounts
e.g. due to KYC of exchanges, and tracing transactions.
Nevertheless, this possibility should not be a concern for
this particular use case, since users will need to specify
an account to debit from, and KYC would be needed to
prevent fraud, etc. Initially, it may be simpler to trial
with a simple centralized council-controlled database.

#### What steps have you taken to validate the idea/market? *

See e.g. [here](wiki/Contact-checklist).

#### How complex will the application need to be for successful functionality? *

An app for bin users would show the amounts debited with
each collection and the mass measured of the collected waste,
as well as charts per month, year, and total.
Councils could still send an invoice as per usual.
Bin users could have a blockchain account for debits, but
this could be opt-in. The currency for the transactions
should probably be the local fiat currency, represented by
a synthetic digital token pegged to the said currency.

#### What challenges do you anticipate encountering were this pilot to be implemented? How can they be mitigated? *

I'm not sure if there needs to be an app for end-users. Councils could still
send an invoice. Bin users could have a blockchain account for debits, but
this could be opt-in.

People could dump waste into neighbours bins, or any bin other than their own,
or anywhere else other than
their own bin. To prevent dumping into other bins, bins should have a lock
on them. However, bins would then need to be unlocked when collecting.
There might be ways to automate this, such as using RFID cards, but they add
complexity, costs, and would still take longer than the traditional
collection procedure. Using a master RFID card with the truck would also
be a security concern. Another option is to use Bluetooth technology,
where the truck has the ability to quickly unlock a bin when it comes in range.
If this solution was developed and worked, it would be quick, secure for bins.
There would still be an attack vector by hacking the technology and using it
in another device, or using the truck or device on it, but if the solution
can be fast enough to not add any noticeable lag to collection times,
then the overall technology seems to be worth sufficient merit to trial.

An alternative is to use [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io), CCTVs,
[neighbourhood watch](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhood_watch), police, etc.,
to monitor and report on suspicious activity with dumping in bins.
Notably, these measures would be needed for dumping that is not in
bins.

Care needs to be taken that financially disadvantaged people are
not worse off with this scheme, and government assistance can
be increased if needed.

Who's going to pay for the waste in rental properties, including share
houses? The ratepayer pays, but in share houses, there is a similar
problem of who pays for utility bills like electricity, water, telecoms,
and gas. A tenant is even incentivized to reduce the waste of a shared
household and that
is produced by flatmates. They may do this anyway without this scheme,
but may get tired of doing so, particularly without an incentive.
Landlords may also sublet rooms, and while this is less common than
leasing a whole dwelling, in this arrangement it is common for
landlords to roll the cost of utilities into the rent, and
it can be expected that they will typically add a higher amount to the rent
than what is paid in bills, e.g. to account for risk.

Nevertheless, paying-by-weight seems fairer than a flat rate.
Dealing with the problem of not further disadvantaging
people facing financial hardships is a more systemic issue,
and can be handled with more government assistance
as needed.

What if councils decide to still charge a flat rate, in order to
be able to fund expenses of waste collection? This is
analogous to flat rates and c/kWh rates in the electricity
market. This should be less likely to occur, since they are a government,
not a for-profit business, and worst-case can cover the cost via
rates. Note that if people don't put their general waste bin out every week,
which wouldn't have a problem with smelliness, etc., if they don't
put organics in it, then the garbage truck doesn't have to stop
to pick it up, saving time and costs.

It would be more complicated, and not really worth the additional
complexity, to charge when a user unlocks the bin and adds waste.
Such a method would probably require a screen, human interface
and computer on and in the bin. It also isn't suitable for shared households
such as families and share housing, where people typically put waste
into a bin inside, then take it out every night or when it gets full.
Charging the person who puts the waste out would be unfair, and
organizing a roster of who puts the bins out would be inconvenient.
While more complicated, a user who takes waste out of the bin could
receive a credit for doing so, although they could then just
dump the waste elsewhere, rather than sort it to put recyclables in
the recycling bin, etc. This would be a perverse outcome.
This method could be used for public bins, but is inconvenient,
and could also disincentivize using them and increase litter,
which would again not be ideal. So it would probably be better
to continue using public bins as accessible without a charge.

Another problem is that people could put waste in the ‘free’,
or lower-cost bins
(e.g. recycling). There could be a fine to discourage this
behaviour, together with transparent recycling bins,
use of reporting such as via [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/)
or even from the garbage truck crew themselves (which would
be possible with transparent bins, since a one-person
crew (the driver) as with a side loader can see it
without even needing to get out of the vehicle.

Waste such as soft plastics
(the kinds that can be put in Redcycle bins, like plastic bags,
packaging, and low-density polyethylene) are problematic
since they are light, and so a charge by mass would not
incentivize proper management of this waste.
While having dedicated kerbside bins for soft plastic recycling
would certainly help, there are still people (I know from
personal experience with living in boarding houses) who
will see a bin and put anything in it, regardless of the colour
of the lid! Thus the above transparent bins, reporting, warnings,
education (talk with them, give them a pamphlet, etc.) and fines
would help to deal with this problem. Additionally,
fines for putting soft plastics in general waste bins is
probably extreme. They would need to be not a large amount if
done at all, although if too small or there's no fine
there's no incentive to change behaviour. Again,
I want to point out that financially disadvantaged people
should be treated compassionately in these cases.

If data is not automatically collected during collection,
and is instead manually entered e.g. by the driver,
that would be less efficient, and also be a potential
source of corruption. Residents could bribe the driver
to not enter the data, or enter a lower weight.
Hence, automating the data entry of masses collected
with the address and account is needed.

It would be an extra inconvenience to grab a Bluetooth chip
when you want to unlock your bin, but not too much, e.g.
if it's attached to a keyring, which you could grab on a
key-rack by the front door on your way out, then it could
automatically unlock and open as you walk up to it.
A bin user could also leave it unlocked, then if someone dumps
a lot of stuff in it you may want to lock it thereafter.

One person gave feedback that he lived in an apartment
of four units and two bins, so each bin was shared
between two units. While this is probably an edge case,
you would probably want to have four bins for each unit,
unless you were happy to split the cost with the person
you share with. As mentioned, having a scale in the bin
and charging when you put stuff in would be more inconvenient,
but maybe not too much with tapping a credit/debit card.
However, using a card would pose a [security/fraud risk](
https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/01/14/why-you-should-never-use-your-debit-card.aspx),
and is [particularly
vulnerable](
http://fossmotorsnews.com/2019-03/Why_You_Shouldnt_Use_a_Debit_Card_at_the_Gas_Pump.html)
for debit card theft since bins are usually unattended.

#### To what extent does your idea have the potential to be scaled? *

Theoretically it can scale worldwide, wherever
waste is generated and collected, provided that there is
support from local citizens and councils, funding, tech, etc.

## Resources
In this section, please elaborate on the state of your resources.

#### What resources have already been dedicated to the project? *

I, James Ray, have been working on this project since
Thursday 21 Feb 2019. No funding has been obtained as of yet.

#### What resources do you need? *

I need funding, technology, expertise, and local councils to trial with.

I should be able to develop the software myself, but I will need to
obtain clients (there
are logs of my efforts on that
[here](wiki/Contact-checklist)
or at least potential ones e.g. via an MoU, a partnership with a garbage truck
manufacturer (or funding to purchase a vehicle and modify it), and
expertise (likely from a garbage truck manufacturer) to modify a garbage truck
as a trial with the weight machine, plus additional technologies that would
improve security and efficiency, as mentioned above, like Bluetooth, and a
database, Holochain or blockchain (the last if universal consensus is needed,
which it may not be).

#### What is the most important thing that can be done to support your work? *

- [x] Connect with governments
- [ ] Connect with technology providers
- [ ] Connect with funders
- [ ] Other:

In the application I marked ""Connect with funders"" as the most important,
however, connecting with governments is probably most important to show
a market demand. However, in order to do a trial with a local council,
they will probably want to see more public support for the idea,
hence [the petition](
https://secure.avaaz.org/en/community_petitions/Local_councils_Incentivize_waste_reduction_by_weighing_general_waste_and_charging_for_the_weight/)
Although, if councils fund consultation with their
communities, that would be
much appreciated!

## Conclusions

Weight-based pricing for both residual and compostable waste, coupled with
multiple fractions for sorting recycling, has been found to
most effectively reduce waste and increase recycling.
Pricing for compostable waste is necessary because
households with sufficient land (a bare patch of soil for a
compost bin), or even those without, can compost their own waste.
For the latter case, tumbler bins, worm farms and bokashi bins can be used.
The scheme in Bjuv in Sweden was very effective (apparently the most of demonstrations studied)
in reducing waste and increasing recycling. However, the cost of the system was high. Additionally,
the case in Bjuv is just one study, and further demonstrations would be needed,
with other considerations or improvements, for more statistically
reliable evidence and conclusions. Other
considerations for policy implementers and include:

- promoting reusable/washable and/or biodegradable products as for nappies and dialysis sacs (with which the non-biodegradable and/or disposable and non-washable forms) tend to produce a lot of waste and may be financially disadvantageous to users of these products);
- cleaning up any dumped waste, although it may not actually increase after a year, as was found in Bjuv in Sweden, coupled with monitoring e.g. via [CleanApp](https://cleanapp.io/) and fines;
- possibly using transparent bins to make incorrectly sorted waste more visible, and education such as stickers, flyers, and talking to people to reduce incorrectly sorted waste. Fines could be used as a last resort.
- mechanical locked gate systems or systems like the Identify, Press, Weight (IPW) Centre may be preferable for
high-density
apartments;
- Using cryptographic, scalable, public database systems such as [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) would have
benefits such as transparency, auditability, benefits of open data and open source software, and ease of scaling
the software to other demonstrations of a Bjuv-like weight-based residual, compost and 9 recyclable fractions scheme.

## Q&A
### Wouldn't it be simpler and better to have smaller bins with a lower fixed cost?
This has pros and cons. It is a simpler scheme. It doesn't allow for highly variable amounts of waste over time, e.g. in an extreme case creating 500 kg of residual waste in an atypical week vs 0.2 kg per week of residual waste normally. I produce around the latter of residual waste normally, but occassionally I might have something large that has to go to landfill, e.g. a fan. In such a case residents could call a kerbside collection, or store the waste and slowly fill the bin(s) up week by week. Offering more bin sizes isn't as cost-reflective as per kg pricing, however, the more bin sizes that are offered, the more cost reflective it can be, but you won't get as cost-reflective as per kg pricing. 

It also doesn't account for the benefits of having multiple additional fractions of recycling waste, collected less often, compared to one mixed recycling bin per week which doesn't allow for soft plastics recycling. It also doesn't provide organic waste. However, that is somewhat orthogonal as you can still have bins for residual waste and organic waste and recyclable fractions collected in the same way in each scheme, but just charge differently and provide more bin sizes.

### Won't dumping increase with this scheme?
The scheme in Sweden has found that dumping was initially a problem, then went back to former levels, and did not observe a noticeable increase in litter. Monitoring and reporting e.g. with CleanApp or just calling council plus cleanup would help to manage dumped waste. The fixed fee component of the scheme, if needed, could be used to fund cleanup of dumped waste. Funding could also be allocated for council officers to patrol public areas to monitor for dumping, graffitti, etc., if and as needed. Note also that federal funding via taxes and a nation-wide deployment in councils could also be used to fund the scheme, rather than decreasing variable weight fees and increasing fixed fees, which would increase residual waste.

### Why not start a business doing this rather than waiting for political will with councils?

I'm not sure what councils will do if people refuse to put council-provided bins out, not pay rates for waste collection, and put out a bin provided by a private waste collector and pay them instead. I'd have to ask councils to see what they think, but I can't imagine they would tolerate that. I'm not sure how viable such a business would be without support from government funding, as was the case in the above Irish study. Some form of deregulation or subsidies to private waste collectors may be needed for this to work. Introducing private enterprises, if successful, would result in increased costs due to profit-seeking (and funding growth and offseting risk, etc.), which would lead todisadvantaging poorer people, particularly without adequate support, which tends to be what occurs. Generally I am more in favour of a publicly funded scheme, and do not wish to pursue this as a business.

### Won't this scheme increase costs for people receiving government assistance / welfare payments?
It would not financially disadvantage poor Australians if landlords must pay for the rates and it is made illegal to mark up the rent with Centrelink recipients due to the cost of waste. This depends on the government implementing this scheme if and only if these conditions hold. It would be enforceable for private landlords since if they threatened to evict Centrelink recipient tenants if they reported them to the government, then Centrelink recipient tenants can take the matter up with NCAT, or analogous authorities in other states, NCAT would resolve the case in the tenants favour: they continue to reside where they are without a markup in the rent due to waste collection. The government would be incentivized to implement the scheme because it has been shown to reduce waste, which will deliver public benefits and be less costly in the long-run.""

### Don't we need more organic waste treatment infrastructure for this scheme to work?
Yes. See more at: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1513152818777012/permalink/2177468449012109/?comment_id=2177647292327558&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D

Application use json file to parse weeks for waste collection and showed active status of each bin over week. You can create 1 to n bins and each bin can have  different collection day.

## Installation

### Step 1: Download files

#### Option 1: Via HACS

Make sure you have HACS installed. If you don't, run `curl -sfSL https://hacs.xyz/install | bash -` in HA.
Then choose Components under HACS. Choose the menu in the upper right, and select Custom repositories. Then add this repo's URL. You should be able to choose to Install now.

#### Option 2: Manual
Clone this repository or download the source code as a zip file and add/merge the `custom_components/` folder with its contents in your configuration directory.

### Step 2: Create JSON file
In repository is saved example of json file called svoz_odpadu.json. Define all weeks in year and assign them yours type of waste collection (1 to n types and Status). Save Json file in `www/` folder of your HA. You can rename it if you want but needs to be change in download.py 
```yaml
{
    ""week"": 1,
    ""Types"": [{
            ""Typ"": ""komunal"",
            ""Status"": 1
        }, {
            ""Typ"": ""plast"",
            ""Status"": 0
        }, {
            ""Typ"": ""papir"",
            ""Status"": 0
        }, {
            ""Typ"": ""bio"",
            ""Status"": 0
        }
    ]
}
```
### Step 3: Configure
Add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:
```yaml
# day of collection - 1 Mondey ,... 7 Sunday
# hour - define time when HA will load new week
# type - type of waste (paper, plastic, bio, mixed waste, battery, oil, etcs)
binary_sensor:
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Komunál
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""komunal""
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Plast
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""plast""
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Papír
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""papir""
  - platform: wastecollection
    name: Bio
    day: ""1""
    hour: ""8""
    type: ""bio""
```

### Step 4: Restart HA
For the newly added integration to be loaded, HA needs to be restarted.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

**User Story #3:** The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

**User Story #4:** Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header ""Javascript and Java"" should have a corresponding id=""Javascript_and_Java"").

**User Story #5:** The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
  
**User Story #6:** The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

**User Story #7:** The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

**User Story #8:** I can see a nav element with a corresponding id=""navbar"".

**User Story #9:** The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

**User Story #10:** Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.

**User Story #11:** The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

**User Story #12:** Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a ""Hello world"" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text ""Hello world"").

**User Story #13:** When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text ""Hello world"", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

**User Story #14:** On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id=""navbar"" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

**User Story #15:** My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

# Microsoft Fix-a-thon 2022

Topic:
Hack for Sustainable India
Build innovative solutions for environmental challenges across India.

## Description:

**Waste management:**

**Title: The Junkies
“Don’t waste your waste”**

A lot of recyclable and reusable household dry waste is simply
dumped into the junkyards without realising the worth of the waste products. A
simple glass bottle is often thrown away in the dustbin when you can actually earn
quite a lot of pennies by selling it off directly to recycling centres and contribute to
waste management at the same time without the need of any middlemen.

## Features



A smart waste management system which :
- Predicts the prices of the waste at user’s end so that they can get the best prices according to the waste they collected without the need to any middlemen.

- Will directly connect users to recycling centres by giving the suggestions of nearby recycling centres.

## Research on How Blockchain Technology Can be Applied in Waste Management

### Traditional Waste Management:

![Traditional Waste Management](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31471559/236680602-97479e20-cac1-4837-936b-b8a03745770d.png)

- The current waste management process still functions as it did 30 years ago.
- It is difficult to track due to the high volume of waste and the variety of processes used.
- The current recycling program has no incentives for participants.

### Decentralized Waste Management Using Blockchain:

![Decentralized Waste Management Using Blockchain](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31471559/236680645-e9046c9a-d512-438f-b9bd-0494a528ebb4.png)

- A decentralized peer-to-peer network connects all parties, removing the unnecessary interference of middlemen.

#### Benefits:
- Real-time tracking of the amount of material recycled, costs, and profits from generation to disposal, promoting transparency.
- Evaluation of the impact of each participant.
- Accountability of all parties involved.
- Empowerment of waste management communities.
- Reduction of logistic costs and manual handling.

### Summary

This research explores how blockchain technology can be applied to waste management. Traditional waste management practices are outdated, difficult to track, and lack incentives for participants. Decentralized waste management using blockchain offers benefits such as real-time tracking, evaluation of impact, and cost reduction. By empowering waste management communities and holding all parties accountable, blockchain technology can revolutionize waste management practices.

## Waste calendar for ioBroker

[German version](./docs/de/README.md)

The adapter reads the garbage collection dates of the provider abfall.io, which various cities or counties use (e.g. [Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/muellabfuhr-termine-abholservice/abfuhrkalender.html), [Ludwigshafen](https://www.ludwigshafen.de/wirtschaftsstark/wirtschaftsbetrieb-ludwigshafen-wbl/abfall-und-wertstoffe/abfall-und-wertstoffkalender-online) or [Landkreis Tuttlingen](https://www.abfall-tuttlingen.de/Abfalltermine-APP/)). The individual types of waste in the city can be selected and displayed in a calendar, for example. 

If the [Whatsapp Adapter]( https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.whatsapp-cmb) is installed in ioBroker, automatic sending of messages before collection is supported per waste type. The number of days to send the message before collection can be set individually for each waste type.

The adapter contains two widgets for the [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme). A calendar with the configured waste types or an icon with different configuration options can be displayed. The icon can start flashing x days before collection if that is configured in the adapter settings for the waste type

If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.

**_Does my city/county qualify for the adapter?:_**

Cities/counties that cooperate with abfall.io. offer similar calendars on their websites, as you can see e.g. on the page of [HEB Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/). If the URL of your waste management company is not accepted by the adapter, you can check on the waste management company page with the developer tool of your browser, if a URL with api.abfall.io (not apiv2.abfall.io !) is called when selecting the city, street. Here is an example from the Chrome developer tool (callable via function key F12 - then select network there and reload the page).

![AbfallKalender_Widget_Json_Table.jpg](./docs/ChromeDeveloperTool.jpg)

**_Other:_**

+  The adapter is restarted every night around 0:05 (+ some random delay in order not to stress the API by too many parallel calls), reads the data from the API of abfall.io and updates the corresponding data points in the object dictionary of the adapter instance. Since a waste calendar usually does not change frequently, this interval should be perfectly sufficient. However, you can change the setting at any time in the instance settings of the waste calendar in ioBroker.

+ Multiple instances (for different cities) can be installed if needed.

The primary goal of the project is to implement a automated garbage collection. 
This project is done as part of [IT825 Designing of Internet of Things](https://infotech.nitk.ac.in/course/it825) taught at National Institute of Technology Karnataka.

## Components used:
- Arduino Yun
- NodeMCU
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Line Follower Bot

## Design
### Line Follower
Arduino Yun is mounted on the bot with a garbage collector which has a shaft built with it.
This shaft is lifted using the servo motor to dump waste at dumping yard.

### Dustbin
Two dustbins were used in this project each made out of cardboard. Inside each dustbin there is a ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor.
Ultrasonic sensor is used to update the amount of garbage in the bin. The servo is used to open the lid and the garbage fell down on the collector.
The dustbins were mounted upside down so that the openings were at the bottom.

# REDIVIVUS
An end-to-end recyclable waste management website.<br/>
Successfully Deployed using firebase hosting. View the deployment [here](https://redivivuspickupguy.web.app/).<br/>

## Problem Statement 
To design and create a product (website) where users / consumers / retailers can easily schedule their recyclable waste pickup according to their convenience with standardized pricing across cities 

## Objectives

<img align=""right"" width=""40%"" src=""https://github.com/Vivek-Hotti/REDIVIVUS/blob/main/images%26visuals/stakeholders.JPG""> 

* To bridge the gap between various stake holders of the Recyclable Waste ecosystem. 
* Facilitate a dynamic website to users with a personalized experience to each one.
* Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.


## General Flow

In the existing system, the journey of a user who wants to sell his recyclable waste, starts with uncertainty and ends with frustation and disatisfaction.

Our main purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience, consistent pricing along with efficient recyclable waste logistics and transparency at every level.
The solution to the existing flawed system is: a recyclable waste management website.

The user comes on our website through the internet. As soon as he enters the website, he is asked to Login / Signup. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by
entering the date and time according to his convenience.

As soon as we receive a request, we take a note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the users’ house at the requested date and time. To ensure transparency we use a digital weighing machine and then and there itself reimburse the predecided amount to the user.

On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop of the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.

It was created as part of an assignment for LIS545 at the University of Washington iSchool","# README
To normalize the data, rows and columns were formatted and values were edited to be consistent with one another. For example, the original Providence dataset chose the following format for the “fiscal_year” attribute: “6/30/2019 0:00.” I edited this value to “2019” to match the fiscal year values for New York City and Franklin. 

Moreover, data was enriched by adding city population data pulled from the U.S. Census Bureau to contextualize and improve the reuse potential of the dataset as a whole. 

Note that this dataset reflects New York City measurements of recycling and refuse tonnage per day. While New York City measures daily counts of recycling and refuse tonnage, Providence and Franklin measure recycling and refuse tonnage annually. This is an important distinction in this dataset. 

The total recycling value was manually calculated by adding metal, glass, and plastic (MPG) tonnage to paper tonnage. Organics were not included in the calculation. It is unclear what materials are included in total recycling values as reported by Providence and Franklin. This necessitates further research. 

The format used to name files is: projectName_dataType_version. There are two data files in this repository: RecyclingPrograms_Raw_VS1.csv and RecyclingPrograms_Normal_VS1.csv.

[](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/gdscbiu)
This is a project by a team from Google Developer Student Club at Bujumbura International University. The project is about a mobile application focused on helping sorting out recyclable waste in order to protect the environment using _Machine Learning_.
## Project Setup:
The Recyclr mobile app is designed to encourage and incentivize users to recycle their plastic bottles, furniture, and paper at home by scanning these items using their smartphones. Users earn points for each item they recycle, which can be redeemed in the app for waste collection tools, children's books, or tree planting. The app is built using Kotlin for Android, Firebase for the database, and Google Cloud Maps API for location tracking.

## Problem Statement:
In Burundi, like many other underdeveloped countries, waste management is a significant problem. In addition, there is an over-importation of plastic bottles, leading to severe pollution in our lake and other natural resources. This pollution not only affects our environment but also has negative impacts on the health of our citizens. It is essential to find a solution that promotes responsible waste management practices and educates people on the importance of recycling to address these challenges. Recyclr is an innovative solution that encourages citizens to recycle by rewarding them for their efforts, making it easier and more convenient for them to dispose of their waste responsibly.

## United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:
The Recyclr mobile app aligns with the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

1. Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable
- Target 11.6: By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.
2. Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- Target 12.5: By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse.
3. Goal 13: Climate Action
- Target 13.3: Improve education, awareness-raising, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction, and early warning.

## Implementation:
The Recyclr mobile app is built using a client-server architecture. The client is developed using Kotlin, which provides a development framework for Android devices. The server-side application is built using Firebase, which provides a scalable and flexible backend solution for storing and retrieving data.

The high-level components of the architecture are:

- Frontend: The frontend of the Recyclr app is developed using Jetpack Compose. The frontend is responsible for handling user interactions, displaying data, and providing a user-friendly interface for the app.

- Backend: The backend of the Recyclr app is developed using Firebase. The backend is responsible for storing and retrieving user data, managing user accounts, and sending notifications to users.

Technologies and Programming Languages: The Recyclr app is developed using the following technologies and programming languages:

- Kotlin - a modern programming language used to write the Android app.
- Jetpack Compose - a modern toolkit for building native Android UI using Kotlin.
- Firebase Authentication - a service used to handle user authentication and sign-in with email or Google account.
- Cloud Firestore - a NoSQL document database used to store and sync app data in real-time.
- Google Maps Android API - a service used to display maps and location data in the app.
- Android SDK - a software development kit used to develop Android applications.
- Gradle - a build automation tool used to build, test, and deploy the app.
- GitHub - a version control system used to store, manage, and share the app code.
## Screens
1. Welcome Screen - This screen displays the Recyclr logo and a message welcoming the user to the app. There are two buttons on this screen, one for signing in with Google and another for signing in with email.

![Onborading screen](/screenshots/1.jpg ""Onborading screen"")

2. Home Screen - This screen displays a list of items that the user can scan for recycling. The items include plastic bottles, furniture, and paper. Each item has a picture and a short description of what can be recycled. There is also a button for scanning an item and a button for viewing the user's rewards balance.
[Screenshot1]

3. Scan Screen - This screen displays a camera viewfinder that the user can use to scan an item. Once the item is scanned, the app uses machine learning to identify the item and provide information on whether it can be recycled or not. If the item can be recycled, the user earns rewards points that can be redeemed for items such as waste collection tools, children's books, or planting a tree.

4. Rewards Screen - This screen displays the user's rewards balance and a list of items that can be redeemed with the rewards points. The user can select an item and redeem it by tapping a button. The screen also displays a history of the user's rewards redemptions.

5. Collection Points Screen - This screen displays a map view of the user's location and collection points for recycled items in the nearby area. The collection points are marked with pins on the map, and the user can tap a pin to view more information about the collection point, such as the types of items that can be dropped off and the pickup schedule.

6. Profile Screen - This screen displays the user's personal information such as profile picture, name, points gained by submitting more waste, their address. And through the profile screen users can exchange their points to coins in order to redeem some eco-friendly tools such as bags,... .

## How to run the app
1. Install Android Studio: Before running the app, you need to install Android Studio on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://developer.android.com/studio

2. Clone the project from GitHub: Once you have installed Android Studio, you can clone the project from GitHub. Open Android Studio and select `Check out project from Version Control` from the welcome screen. Then, select `Git` from the dropdown menu and enter the URL of the Recyclr app GitHub repository: https://github.com/GDSC-Bujumbura-International-University/recyclr.git

3. Open the project in Android Studio: After cloning the project, Android Studio will ask you to open it. Click on `Yes` to open the project in Android Studio.

4. Sync Gradle: Once the project is open in Android Studio, you need to sync Gradle. This will download all the dependencies required by the app. To do this, go to `File` -> `Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

5. Set up Firebase: The Recyclr app uses Firebase services for authentication and database management. You will need to set up a Firebase project and add the configuration files to the app. You can follow the instructions in the Firebase documentation to set up a project and add the configuration files: https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup

6. Run the app: Once you have set up Firebase, you can run the app on an emulator or a physical device. To do this, click on the `Run` button in Android Studio, select the device you want to run the app on, and click on `OK`. Android Studio will build and install the app on the selected device.

7. Test the app: Once the app is installed on the device, you can test its features. You can scan plastic bottles, furniture, and paper using the camera, and earn points that can be redeemed in the store. You can also log in using Google Auth or sign in by email.

Note: This is a high-level guide, and the steps may vary depending on the version of Android Studio you are using and the configuration of your development environment. For more detailed information on running an app in Android Studio, you can refer to the official Android Studio documentation: https://developer.android.com/studio/run

## Feedback / Testing / Iteration:
To test the Recyclr app, we conducted user testing with real users outside of our team. Based on their feedback, we implemented the following improvements to the app:

- Users found it difficult to scan items using the app. We improved the scanning process by adding a tutorial and improving the user interface of the scanning screen.

- Users wanted more rewards for recycling items. We added new rewards such as free waste collection tools and discounts on sustainable products.

- Users wanted more information about what happens to the recycled items. We added a feature to show users how their recycled items are processed and reused.

## Challenge Faced:
One challenge we faced while building the Recyclr app was integrating the Google Cloud Maps API for location tracking. We had to decide on the best way to track user location without compromising user privacy. We addressed this issue by using a geofencing technique that only tracks user location when they are within a specific range of a recycling pickup point.

## Success and Completion of Solution:
The Recyclr app has been successful in promoting sustainable waste management practices and educating users on what can and cannot be recycled at home. The app has been downloaded by over [WIP]

# Projects

## MSc. Thesis Project

Evaluating the potential of Extended Producer Responsibility returns for
a small local waste collection company through a brand audit of riverine
plastic waste in Durban, South Africa.

### Description

This Master’s Thesis Project focuses on determining the growth
opportunities for a small-sized plastic recycling enterprise in light of
the shift from a voluntary to a mandatory Extended Producer
Responsibility (EPR) policy in South Africa.

To achieve this goal in the context of a small start-up in Durban, South
Africa , a brand audit is conducted to identify the top brands that can
be targeted for financing or partnership opportunities. The company,
called [TRI ECO Tours](https://triecotours.co.za/), is a small tourism
and waste collection startup in Durban operated by Siphiwe Rakgabale.

### Research Question

What is the characterization by type, application, and brand of plastic
waste collected in the uMngeni River system in Durban, South Africa?

### Data

The data was collected throughout two months in Durban, South Africa
right before the rainy season. The collection took place in 6 different
litterboom locations throughout Durban. The data gathered was the audit
of the occurence of the brands washed into the litterbooms.

The package provides access to three data sets.

``` r
library(durbanplasticwaste)
```

The `litterboom_counts` data set has 7 variables and 2784 observations.
For an overview of the variable names, see the following table.

## MSc. Semester Project

Examination of non-recycled marine plastic litter in order to identify
recycling and beneficiation pathways in Durban, South Africa

### Description

This Semester Thesis Project focuses on determining the distribution of
plastic litter on the Durban beachfront in order to identify key targets
for policy and financial support through the South African EPR policy to
reduce plastic spills into the environment and promote higher recycling
rates.

Research Question

What types and amounts of plastic are found along the beachfront in the
mangroves of Durban-North, South Africa?

### Data

The data was collected in collaboration with a local team that provided
the waste for the study. Two different approaches were used to clean up
the waste. One to collect the waste floating on the river, preventing it
from reaching the sea and one to collect waste washed ashore at the
beaches. Three locations along the rivers close to settlements and one
at the beach in Durban North.

The package provides access to one data set of this project.

``` r
library(durbanplasticwaste)
```

The `plastic_types` data set has 16 variables and 13 observations. 11
observations were made on the beach which were added together in the row
that has “Beach Total” as the value for the variable “place”. One
observation was done at a litterboom. For an overview of the variable
names, see the following table.

``` r

## Examples

The `litterboom_counts` data identifies 40 unique groups that own the
identified brands. The top 10 brands are shown in the following table.
All other brands are lumped together as OTHER.

``` r

library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

litterboom_counts |> 
  mutate(group = factor(group)) |> 
  mutate(group = fct_lump(group, n = 10, other_level = ""OTHER"")) |> 
  group_by(group) |> 
  summarise(
    count = sum(count)
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(count)) |> 
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 0)

Simple asyncio client for the [Jätekukko](https://www.jatekukko.fi)
[Omakukko](https://tilasto.jatekukko.fi/indexservice2.jsp) API.

The API of this package is modeled closely after the Omakukko
API. Only read operations are implemented (well apart from, strictly
speaking, login/logout), and there are no plans to add support for any
write ones.

Usage in a nutshell:

- construct an aiohttp [`ClientSession`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#client-session),
- construct a `Pytekukko` client with it and your credentials,
- invoke methods on the client.

The Omakukko API uses cookie based sessions, use a persistent aiohttp
[`CookieJar`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_reference.html#cookiejar)
to maintain client session across interpreter restarts.

High level client methods handle logging in when the need to do so is
detected. If the detection is successful, there is no need to
separately track session expiration or use the `login` method in the
first place.

For usage examples, see utilities in the `pytekukko.examples`
package. Executables and dependencies for these are installed when the
package is installed with the `examples` extra, invoke them with
`--help` for usage and setup information:

- `pytekukko-collection-schedules`: output collection schedules in JSON
- `pytekukko-invoice-headers`: output basic info on invoices in JSON
- `pytekukko-next-collections`: output next collection dates in JSON
- `pytekukko-update-google-calendar`: update Google Calendar with
  events for next collections

## Disclaimer

This package is not supported by or endorsed by Jätekukko. Do not
bother them with questions or issues related to it.

# Microsoft Fix-a-thon 2022

Topic:
Hack for Sustainable India
Build innovative solutions for environmental challenges across India.

## Description:

**Waste management:**

**Title: The Junkies
“Don’t waste your waste”**

A lot of recyclable and reusable household dry waste is simply
dumped into the junkyards without realising the worth of the waste products. A
simple glass bottle is often thrown away in the dustbin when you can actually earn
quite a lot of pennies by selling it off directly to recycling centres and contribute to
waste management at the same time without the need of any middlemen
## Demo

https://junkies-fixathon.netlify.app/

## Features



A smart waste management system which :
- Predicts the prices of the waste at user’s end so that they can get the best prices according to the waste they collected without the need to any middlemen.

- Will directly connect users to recycling centres by giving the suggestions of nearby recycling centres.

## Waste calendar for ioBroker

[German version](./docs/de/README.md)

The adapter reads the garbage collection dates of the provider abfall.io, which various cities or counties use (e.g. [Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/muellabfuhr-termine-abholservice/abfuhrkalender.html), [Ludwigshafen](https://www.ludwigshafen.de/wirtschaftsstark/wirtschaftsbetrieb-ludwigshafen-wbl/abfall-und-wertstoffe/abfall-und-wertstoffkalender-online) or [Landkreis Tuttlingen](https://www.abfall-tuttlingen.de/Abfalltermine-APP/)). The individual types of waste in the city can be selected and displayed in a calendar, for example. 

If the [Whatsapp Adapter]( https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.whatsapp-cmb) is installed in ioBroker, automatic sending of messages before collection is supported per waste type. The number of days to send the message before collection can be set individually for each waste type.

The adapter contains two widgets for the [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme). A calendar with the configured waste types or an icon with different configuration options can be displayed. The icon can start flashing x days before collection if that is configured in the adapter settings for the waste type

If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.If [VIS](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.vis) or [VIS 2 (!)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iobroker.vis-2-beta?activeTab=readme) AND the [inventwo](https://github.com/inventwo/ioBroker.vis-inventwo) widget set are installed, a datapoint containing the widget code for a JSON table is created.

**_Does my city/county qualify for the adapter?:_**

Cities/counties that cooperate with abfall.io. offer similar calendars on their websites, as you can see e.g. on the page of [HEB Hagen](https://www.heb-hagen.de/rund-um-den-muell/). If the URL of your waste management company is not accepted by the adapter, you can check on the waste management company page with the developer tool of your browser, if a URL with api.abfall.io (not apiv2.abfall.io !) is called when selecting the city, street. Here is an example from the Chrome developer tool (callable via function key F12 - then select network there and reload the page).

![AbfallKalender_Widget_Json_Table.jpg](./docs/ChromeDeveloperTool.jpg)

**_Other:_**

+  The adapter is restarted every night around 0:05 (+ some random delay in order not to stress the API by too many parallel calls), reads the data from the API of abfall.io and updates the corresponding data points in the object dictionary of the adapter instance. Since a waste calendar usually does not change frequently, this interval should be perfectly sufficient. However, you can change the setting at any time in the instance settings of the waste calendar in ioBroker.

+ Multiple instances (for different cities) can be installed if needed.

Team ""Phantom Pain"" with members- Shaswat Swain, Ankit Jena, Agni Panda

# Topic:
Waste Management

## PROBLEM STATEMENT I :
Lack of an economically accommodating system to curb and manage waste.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT II :
State of the informal garbage collectors in the country.

# The Solution:
Our idea defines an Everyday Waste Control  System gamified by a ‘Credit’ based ideology that will provide just the right push to the people in a country like India to start managing their waste better.

![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/9DCE/production/_107989304_gettyimages-1140621813.jpg)

In September 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49085346) the claim that a ""quiet green tax"" was deterring gardeners from recycling their waste.

Analysis showed some UK councils were charging up to £100 a year for a kerbside collection, despite one in four councils providing a free service.

Critics said the service should be free to residents to reduce the amount of clippings being sent to landfill.

Councils said the service was not statutory and home composting was a cheaper alternative.

The BBC's Shared Data Unit looked at the annual subscription charges levied by local councils for regular kerbside garden waste collections. It found:

- More than 140 local authorities provided a free collection, but charges for other councils ranged from £18 to £96.
- The average annual charge was around £31, with higher costs levied in London and the South East.

This piece of content was produced by a regional newspaper reporter working alongside BBC staff.

The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:

A dictionary how to handle (and recycle) waste in Belgium, in Dutch.

Data is mainly taken from the [*afvalalfabet*](https://www.merelbeke.be/sites/default/files/bijlage/Afvalalfabet.pdf) from the municipality of *Merelbeke* and the [*sorteerwijzer*](https://www.mirom.be/sorteerwijzer) of *MIROM*.

You can look at the [**`data.csv`** file](data/data.csv) for a list of
items, and how to get rid of these.

The [**`tips.csv`** file](data/tips.csv) contains a set of *tips and tricks* to avoid
waste. The [**`synonyms.csv`** file](data/synonyms.csv) lists synonyms. These
synonyms will be typesetted a second time under a different name. This can be
useful if the same entry occurs multiple times with a different specification.

If there are still items not on the list, or you want to make a correction, you
can open a *pull request*.

There are versions that use the [*OpenDyslexic*](https://opendyslexic.org/) font
to make it more convenient for dyslexia patients to work with this dictionary.

Een woordenboek dat beschrijft hoe men afval in België hoort te sorteren. Het is
opgesteld in het Nederlands.

De data komt hoofdzakelijk van het [*afvalalfabet*](https://www.merelbeke.be/sites/default/files/bijlage/Afvalalfabet.pdf) van de gemeente *Merelbeke* en van de [*sorteerwijzer*](https://www.mirom.be/sorteerwijzer) van *MIROM*.

Het [**`data.csv`** bestand](data/data.csv) bevat een lijst van items en hoe
deze te sorteren.

Het [**`tips.csv`** bestand](data/tips.csv) bevat een lijst met ""*tips and
tricks*"" hoe afval voorkomen. Het [**`synonyms.csv`** bestand](data/synonyms.csv) bevat
een lijst met synoniemen. Dit is handig wanneer eenzelfde object met
verschillende spcifictaties voorkomt, omdat al die items dan worden gekopieerd
onder een andere naam.

Men kan een *pull request* maken om items toe te voegen of te corrigeren.

Er zijn versies gemaakt met het [*OpenDyslexic* lettertype](https://opendyslexic.org/)
om het woordenboek meer toegankelijk te maken voor mensen met dyslexie.

De [*travis build*](travis-ci.com/github/hapytex/afvalwoordenboek) maakt een [pdf-versie van de data](https://hapytex.github.io/afvalwoordenboek/afvalwoordenboek_light.pdf) [*(donker)*](https://hapytex.github.io/afvalwoordenboek/afvalwoordenboek_dark.pdf).

## About

This project aims to implement an **autonomous waste management system**, where garbage containers are monitored by sensors and the routes of the different garbage trucks are optimized in real-time by an algorithm, instead of being the same every day.

This allows garbage trucks to be more efficient and reduce the time spent on the road, as well as the fuel consumption and the CO2 emissions.

## Dependencies

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

- [NAP-Vanetza](https://code.nap.av.it.pt/mobility-networks/vanetza)

- Internet connection for [Mapbox Directions API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/directions/) calls

- Python packages on `requirements.txt` (using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)


## Installation

### Vanetza containers

To start all docker containers of Vanetza, open a terminal window on the root of this project and run the following commands:

```
cd script
sudo docker-compose up --build
```

Do not close this terminal window.

### Dashboard

To start the dashboard, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd dashboard
python3 main.py
```

Do not close this terminal window. The dashboard server should be running on `http://localhost:8000/`.

### OBU script

To start the OBU script, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd script
python3 obu.py
```

Do not close this terminal window.

### RSU script

To start the RSU script, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd script
python3 rsu.py
```

Do not close this terminal window.

### Sensor simulator

To start the sensor simulator, open a new terminal and run the following commands:

```
cd sensor
python3 sensor_simulator.py
```

As soon as the garbage containers start filling up, the trucks will start moving to them and their routes will appear on the dashboard map.

## Configuration

Some parameters of this project can be modified, namely:

- Number of gargabe containers and its respective position

    - defined on the [`sensor/sensor_position.json` file](/sensor/sensor_position.json)
    - with 30 default values

- Home (initial and final) position of each one of the garbage trucks
    
    - defined on [this lines of `script/obu.py` script](/script/obu.py#L13-L20)
    - with the default values of:
        - `[40.642050351865485, -8.646329251761603]` for truck #1 (OBU1)
        - `[40.64302876711141, -8.653112236802189]` for truck #2 (OBU2)
        - `[40.64556274792325, -8.64612107999697]` for truck #3 (OBU3)

- Fill percentage at which the garbage container is considered full and will start to publish DENM messages to be emptied

    - defined on [this line of `sensor/sensor_simulator.py` script](/sensor/sensor_simulator.py#L14) and on [this line of `script/rsu.py` script](/script/rsu.py#L9)
    - with default value of `70`%

- Initial fill percentage of the garbage containers to speed up the simulation

    - defined on [this line of `sensor/sensor_simulator.py` script](/sensor/sensor_simulator.py#L11)
    - with default value of `0`%

- Maximum threshold percentage of the total number of garbage containers that a single truck can have assigned to it, to distribute the jobs more equally between the trucks

    - defined on [this line of `script/rsu.py` script](/script/rsu.py#L12)
    - with default value of `75`%

The sensor data (garbage containers fill percentage) can also be changed in real-time manually, by changing the respective line on the [`sensor/sensor_data.txt` file](/sensor/sensor_data.txt), instead of using the sensor simulator script.",0,0,1,0,waste-management,"[autonomous-systems, mqtt, python, smart-cities, smart-city, universidade-de-aveiro, vanet, vanetza, waste-management]",00000

ESC204 Praxis III Final Design Project

Afrin Prio, Fengyuan Liu, Mary Cheng, Nathanael Kusanda, Patrick Samaha, Vivek Dhande

GarbageGo is a garbage bin train system complemented by a text messaging system, aiming to build upon Gazipur's current system of informal waste colleciton to more effectively and efficiently capture waste. By involving separate, regionalised trains for recycling, organic, and garbage, the system allows for the separate movement of different types of waste, better enabling sorting and processing.  

![garbagego](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84566002/167674923-165a64ca-0439-4399-a62b-d3706d4609db.jpg)

In this prototype, the text messaging system is represented with MQTT topics. Each train contains an Arduino Nano RP2040 with code written in RaspberryPi to collect data on weight and volume, which can be found in '/bin-arduino/code.py'. On a computer, the file /server-collector/server.py can be run, establishing a central processing server for the data. Note that the SSID and password entries in 'secrets.py' should be updated for your own Wi-Fi. Each collector would then be able to subscribe to their region's MQTT topic, and receive notifications when a bin is full and ready for collection.

# REDIVIVUS
An end-to-end recyclable waste management website.<br/>
Successfully Deployed using firebase hosting. View the deployment [here](https://redivivuspickupguy.web.app/).<br/>

## Problem Statement 
To design and create a product (website) where users / consumers / retailers can easily schedule their recyclable waste pickup according to their convenience with standardized pricing across cities 

## Objectives

<img align=""right"" width=""40%"" src=""https://github.com/Vivek-Hotti/REDIVIVUS/blob/main/images%26visuals/stakeholders.JPG""> 

* To bridge the gap between various stake holders of the Recyclable Waste ecosystem. 
* Facilitate a dynamic website to users with a personalized experience to each one.
* Help the user to schedule pickup according to their convenience.


## General Flow

In the existing system, the journey of a user who wants to sell his recyclable waste, starts with uncertainty and ends with frustation and disatisfaction.

Our main purpose remains to simplify and enhance user experience, consistent pricing along with efficient recyclable waste logistics and transparency at every level.
The solution to the existing flawed system is: a recyclable waste management website.

The user comes on our website through the internet. As soon as he enters the website, he is asked to Login / Signup. After which he could schedule a pickup from his home by
entering the date and time according to his convenience.

As soon as we receive a request, we take a note of the date and timing that the user has entered. We send our representative to the users’ house at the requested date and time. To ensure transparency we use a digital weighing machine and then and there itself reimburse the predecided amount to the user.

On the spot, the waste is segregated by our well-informed and trained representative into different commodities. Then we directly contact the recycling plants nearest to the locality of the user and drop of the recyclable waste to the recycling plant at minimum commission.

## Installation Guide 
```
pip3 install sharpai-hub
sharpai-cli yolov7_reid start
```

<details> 
   <summary><h3>Prerequisites</h3></summary>
	1. Docker (Latest version) <br />
	2. Python (v3.6 to v3.10 will work fine)
</details>
<details>
  <summary><h3>Step-by-step guide</h3></summary

```NOTE: Before executing any of commands mentioned below please start Docker.```
```This guide is to install the sharpai and run the yolov7_reid service but can also be used to start other services.```
1) Install SharpAI-Hub by running the following command in a Command Prompt and Terminal. Remeber this as Command Prompt 1. This will be needed in further steps:
	```
	pip3 install sharpai-hub
	```
2) Now run the following command:
	```
	sharpai-cli yolov7_reid start
	```
**NOTE: If in a Windows system after running command mentioned in Step 2 if you get error:**
`'sharpai-cli' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`
Then it means environment variable is not set for Python on your system. More on this at the end of page in FAQ section.

3) If you are using Windows and get error in step 2 you can also use following command line to start yolov7_reid

```
python3 -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```
OR

```
python -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```
4) Go to directory ```C:\Users``` and open the folder with name of current user. Here look for a folder  ```.sharpai``` . In ```.sharpai``` folder you will see a folder ```yolov7_reid```. Open it and start a new Command Prompt here. Remember this as ```Command Prompt 2```

5) In Command Prompt 2 run the below command:

```
docker compose up
```

**NOTE: DO NOT TERMINATE THIS COMMAND.** Let it complete. After running the above command it will take roughly 15-20 minutes or even more time to complete depending upon your system specifications and internet speed. After 5-10 minutes of running the command in the images tab of Docker will images will start to appear. If the command ran successful then there must be seven images in images tab plus one container named as `yolov7_reid` in the container tab.

6) Go to folder ```yolov7_reid``` mentioned in step 4. In this folder there will be file ```.env```. Delete it. Now close the Command Prompt 1. Open and new Command prompt and run the following command again. We will call this as Command Prompt 3. 

```
sharpai-cli yolov7_reid start
```
OR

```
python3 -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```
OR

```
python -m sharpai_hub.cli yolov7_reid start
```

7) Running command in Step 6 will open a Signup/Signin page in the browser and in Command Prompt it will ask for the Labelstudio Token. After Signing up in you will be taken to your account. At the top right corrent you will see a small cirle with your account initials. Click on it and after that click on `Account Setting`. Here at the right side of page you will see a Access token. Copy the token and paste it carefully in the command prompt 3.
	  
8) Add Camera to Home-Assistant, you can use ""Generic Camera"" to add camera with RTSP url
	  
9) In this step, we will obtain the camera entity ID of your cameras. After adding your camera to `home-Assistant`, go to the `Overview` tab. Here all your cameras will be listed. Click on the video stream of a camera, after which a small popup will open. At the top right of the popup, click the gear icon to open the settings page. A new popup will open with a few editable properties. Here look for Entity ID, which is in the format `camera.IP_ADDRESS_OF_CAMERA`, copy/note this entity ID (these entity ids will be required later). If you have multiple cameras, we will need each cameras Entity ID. Note all these camera entity IDs.

	  
10) Run following two commands to open and edit the `configuration.yaml` of Home-Assistant:
	  
```
docker exec -ti home-assistant /bin/bash 
```	
	  
```
vi configuration.yaml
```
	  
**NOTE FOR WINDOWS SYSTEM USERS: These commands wont work with windows Systems. For Windows system, please open Docker (the instance of Docker, which is already running from the start) and in the container tab, open the `yolov7_reid`. Here look for the `home-assistant` container. Hover your mouse cursor on the `home-assistant` container, and a few options will appear. Click on `cli`. An inbuilt console will start on the same page. If the typing cursor keeps blinking and nothing shows up on the inbuilt console, then click on `Open in External Terminal`, which is just above the blinking cursor. After clicking it, a new command prompt will open. To check everything is working as expected, run the command `ls` and see if the commands list the files and folders in the config folder.**
	  
**Now run a command `vi configuration.yaml`. This command will open your configuration file of the `home-assistant` in the Vi editor. Vi Editor is a bit tricky if you are unfamiliar with using it. You will now have to enter into Insert mode to add the integration code mentioned in Step 9 to the configuration file. Press the `I` key to enter Insert mode and go end of the file using the down arrow key. Next, press the right mouse (while the mouse cursor is inside the command prompt window) while in the command prompt. This will paste the integration code that you had copied earlier. After making changes to the config file, press the escape key, type the following `:wq` (yes with colon) and press enter key. You will be back taken to `/config #`. This command `:wq` means you want to write changes to the config file and quit (I told you Vi is a bit tricky for beginners). You can now close the command prompt.**
	  

11) Add the below code to the end of `configuration.yaml` file. 
	  
**Here, replace `camera.<camera_entity_id>` with the camera entity ID we obtained in Step 9. If you have multiple cameras then keep adding the `entity_id` under `images_processing`.**
	  
	  
```
stream:
  ll_hls: true
  part_duration: 0.75
  segment_duration: 6

image_processing:
  - platform: sharpai
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.<camera_entity_id>
    scan_interval: 1
```

If you have multiple cameras then after changing the 'entity_id' the code will become similar to this:
	  
```
stream:
  ll_hls: true
  part_duration: 0.75
  segment_duration: 6

image_processing:
  - platform: sharpai
    source:
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_44
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_45
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_46
      - entity_id: camera.192_168_29_47
    scan_interval: 1
```

12) At `home-assistant` homepage `http://localhost:8123` select `Developer Tools`. Look for and click `Check Configuration` under `Configuration Validation`. If everything went well then it must show ""Configuration Valid'. Click `Restart`.Now go to the `container` tab of docker, click three vertical dots under `Actions` and press restart. Open the `Overview` tab of `home-assitant`. If you see `Image Processing` beside your cameras and below it `Sharp IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_CAMERA`, then congrats. Everything is working as expected.

## License

The Kerberos Open Source project is licensed with BY-NC-SA 4.0, this means that everyone can use Kerberos and modify if to their needs, in a non commercial activity.

More information [**about this license**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/license).

## Vote for features

[**Report features**](https://feathub.com/kerberos-io/machinery) if you think something is missing, and should be added to Kerberos Open Source, we love to hear about your ideas.

## Supported cameras

[**In this thread**](https://github.com/kerberos-io/machinery/issues/136) you can find a list of cameras that users confirmed working properly. Do you have a working camera missing from this list? Report your camera [**here**](https://github.com/kerberos-io/machinery/issues/136).

## Why Kerberos?

As burglary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders, and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos Open Source goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have their own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

## Introduction

Kerberos Open Source is perfect for personal usage. It's great if you only have a couple of surveillance cameras to be managed. A Kerberos agent (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi or inside a Docker container) runs for each camera. Their are many different installation possibilities, please have a look at [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) or [**installation page**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation).

Every Kerberos agent has it's own web interface (front-end) to review media recording, and processing engine (back-end) of a specific surveillance camera. The Open Source version doesn't come with a central overview of all recordings generated by your Kerberos agents. For this feature we highly recommend Kerberos cloud.

If you want to manage more than 10 Kerberos agents, it's recommended to use [**Kerberos Enterprise**](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise). This will help you to scale, support high availability and load balancing. Check out [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) section for a better understanding of when to use what.

## Machinery

[**The machinery**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/introduction) is the processing engine of Kerberos Open Source. It's an image processing framework, written in C++, who benefits from other third party libraries (OpenCV, etc). It takes images from the type of camera (USB-, IP- or RPi-camera) you've configured in the configuration files and executes one or more algorithms and post-processes (e.g. save a snapshot). The configuration files allow you to define the type of camera, post-processes, conditions and much more; it's highly configurable. It's important to note that the machinery, out-of-the-box, can handle only one camera at a time.

## How does it work?

[Read more](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/machinery#project-structure) on our documentation website to have a better understanding of how the machinery works.

## Installation

Kerberos Open Source comes with different installation flavours (it includes both the machinery and web repository). The reason is because depending on the use case one option is better than another. A short list of recommendations:

- [**KiOS**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, and you only want to run a Kerberos agent on it.
- [**Raspbian**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, but you want other services running next to the Kerberos agent.
- [**Docker**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a lot of IP cameras, and/or don't want to mess with dependencies.
- [**Generic**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You want to develop/extend Kerberos with your own features, or you want to run a Kerberos agent on a not supported OS/architecure.

## Compile from source

Update the packages and kernel, and install some development tools.

```ts
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git cmake subversion libav-tools dh-autoreconf libcurl4-openssl-dev yasm libx264-dev pkg-config libssl-dev
```

Install the FFmpeg library with x264 support.

```ts
git clone https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg ffmpeg
cd ffmpeg && git checkout remotes/origin/release/2.8
./configure --enable-gpl --enable-libx264 --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
make && sudo make install
```

Go to your home directory, or any place your prefer and pull the machinery from Github. Afterwards create a build directory and start the compilation.

```ts
cd && git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/machinery
cd machinery && mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make && make check && sudo make install
```

After the machinery is build and installed succesfully, you can enable `kerberosio` to start on boot.

```ts
sudo systemctl enable kerberosio
```

## :thinking: Prerequisites

- An IP camera which supports a RTSP H264 encoded stream,
  - (or) a USB camera, Raspberry Pi camera or other camera, that [you can tranform to a valid RTSP H264 stream](https://github.com/kerberos-io/camera-to-rtsp).
- Any hardware (ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64, AMD) that can run a binary or container, for example: a Raspberry Pi, NVidia Jetson, Intel NUC, a VM, Bare metal machine or a full blown Kubernetes cluster.

## :video_camera: Is my camera working?

There are a myriad of cameras out there (USB, IP and other cameras), and it might be daunting to know if Kerberos Agent will work for your camera. [Therefore we are listing all the camera models that are acknowlegded by the community](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/issues/59). Feel free to add your camera to the list as well!

## Quickstart - Docker

The easiest to get your Kerberos Agent up and running is to use our public image on [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kerberos/agent). Once you have selected a specific tag, run below `docker` command, which will open the web interface of your Kerberos agent on port `80`, and off you go. For a more configurable and persistent deployment have a look at [Running and automating a Kerberos Agent](#running-and-automating-a-kerberos-agent).

    docker run -p 80:80 --name mycamera -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

If you want to connect to an USB or Raspberry Pi camera, [you'll need to run our side car container](https://github.com/kerberos-io/camera-to-rtsp) which proxy the camera to an RTSP stream. In that case you'll want to configure the Kerberos Agent container to run in the host network, so it can connect directly to the RTSP sidecar.

    docker run --network=host --name mycamera -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

## Quickstart - Balena

Run Kerberos Agent with [Balena Cloud](https://www.balena.io/) super powers. Monitor your Kerberos Agent with seamless remote access, over the air updates, an encrypted public `https` endpoint and many more. Checkout our application `video-surveillance` on [Balena Hub](https://hub.balena.io/apps/2064752/video-surveillance), and create your first or fleet of Kerberos Agent(s).

[![deploy with balena](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/kerberos-io/balena-agent)

## Quickstart - Snap

Run Kerberos Agent with our [Snapcraft package](https://snapcraft.io/kerberosio).

     snap install kerberosio

Once installed you can find your Kerberos Agent configration at `/var/snap/kerberosio/common`. Run the Kerberos Agent as following

    sudo kerberosio.agent -action=run -port=80

## A world of Kerberos Agents

The Kerberos Agent is an isolated and scalable video (surveillance) management agent with a strong focus on user experience, scalability, resilience, extension and integration. Next to the Kerberos Agent, Kerberos.io provides many other tools such as [Kerberos Factory](https://github.com/kerberos-io/factory), [Kerberos Vault](https://github.com/kerberos-io/vault) and [Kerberos Hub](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub) to provide additional capabilities: bring your own cloud, bring your own storage, central overview, live streaming, machine learning etc.

As mentioned above Kerberos.io applies the concept of agents. An agent is running next to (or on) your camera, and is processing a single camera feed. It applies motion based or continuous recording and make those recordings available through a user friendly web interface. A Kerberos Agent allows you to connect to other cloud services or integrates with custom applications. Kerberos Agent is used for personal usage and scales to enterprise production level deployments.

This repository contains everything you'll need to know about our core product, Kerberos Agent. Below you'll find a brief list of features and functions.

- Low memory and CPU usage.
- Simplified and modern user interface.
- Multi architecture (ARMv7, ARMv8, amd64, etc).
- Multi camera support: IP Cameras (H264), USB cameras and Raspberry Pi Cameras [through a RTSP proxy](https://github.com/kerberos-io/camera-to-rtsp).
- Single camera per instance (e.g. one container per camera).
- Primary and secondary stream setup (record full-res, stream low-res).
- Low resolution streaming through MQTT and full resolution streaming through WebRTC.
- Ability to specifiy conditions: offline mode, motion region, time table, continuous recording, etc.
- Post- and pre-recording on motion detection.
- Ability to create fragmented recordings, and streaming though HLS fMP4.
- [Deploy where you want](#how-to-run-and-deploy-a-kerberos-agent) with the tools you use: `docker`, `docker compose`, `ansible`, `terraform`, `kubernetes`, etc.
- Cloud storage/persistance: Kerberos Hub, Kerberos Vault and Dropbox. [(WIP: Minio, Storj, Google Drive, FTP etc.)](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/issues/95)
- WIP: Integrations (Webhooks, MQTT, Script, etc).
- REST API access and documentation through Swagger (trigger recording, update configuration, etc).
- MIT License

## How to run and deploy a Kerberos Agent

As described before a Kerberos Agent is a container, which can be deployed through various ways and automation tools such as `docker`, `docker compose`, `kubernetes` and the list goes on. To simplify your life we have come with concrete and working examples of deployments to help you speed up your Kerberos.io journey.

We have documented the different deployment models [in the `deployments` directory](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments) of this repository. There you'll learn and find how to deploy using:

- [Static binary](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#0-static-binary)
- [Docker](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#1-docker)
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#2-docker-compose)
- [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#3-kubernetes)
- [Red Hat OpenShift with Ansible](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#4-red-hat-ansible-and-openshift)
- [Terraform](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#5-terraform)
- [Salt](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#6-salt)
- [Balena](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#8-balena)
- [Snap](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments#9-snap)

By default your Kerberos Agents will store all its configuration and recordings inside the container. To help you automate and have a more consistent data governance, you can attach volumes to configure and persist data of your Kerberos Agents, and/or configure each Kerberos Agent through environment variables.

## Access the Kerberos Agent

Once you have deployed the Kerberos Agent, using one of the deployment models described above, you will be able to access the Kerberos Agent user interface. A login page is presented asking for some credentials.

The default username and password for the Kerberos Agent is:

- Username: `root`
- Password: `root`

**_Please note that you change the username and password for a final installation, see [Configure with environment variables](#configure-with-environment-variables) below._**

## Configure and persist with volume mounts

An example of how to mount a host directory is shown below using `docker`, but is applicable for [all the deployment models and tools described above](#running-and-automating-a-kerberos-agent).

You attach a volume to your container by leveraging the `-v` option. To mount your own configuration file and recordings folder, execute as following:

    docker run -p 80:80 --name mycamera \
    -v $(pwd)/agent/config:/home/agent/data/config \
    -v $(pwd)/agent/recordings:/home/agent/data/recordings \
    -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

More example [can be found in the deployment section](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/master/deployments) for each deployment and automation tool. Please note to verify the permissions of the directory/volume you are attaching. More information in [this issue](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/issues/80).

    chmod -R 755 kerberos-agent/
    chown 100:101 kerberos-agent/ -R

## Configure with environment variables

Next to attaching the configuration file, it is also possible to override the configuration with environment variables. This makes deployments easier when leveraging `docker compose` or `kubernetes` deployments much easier and scalable. Using this approach we simplify automation through `ansible` and `terraform`.

    docker run -p 80:80 --name mycamera \
    -e AGENT_NAME=mycamera \
    -e AGENT_TIMEZONE=Europe/Brussels \
    -e AGENT_CAPTURE_IPCAMERA_RTSP=rtsp://fake.kerberos.io/stream \
    -e AGENT_CAPTURE_CONTINUOUS=true \
    -d --restart=always kerberos/agent:latest

## Contribute with Codespaces

One of the major blockers for letting you contribute to an Open Source project is to setup your local development machine. Why? Because you might have already some tools and libraries installed that are used for other projects, and the libraries you would need for Kerberos Agent, for example FFmpeg, might require a different version. Welcome to the dependency hell..

By leveraging codespaces, which the Kerberos Agent repo supports, you will be able to setup the required development environment in a few minutes. By opening the `<> Code` tab on the top of the page, you will be able to create a codespace, [using the Kerberos Devcontainer](https://github.com/kerberos-io/devcontainer) base image. This image requires all the relevant dependencies: FFmpeg, OpenCV, Golang, Node, Yarn, etc.

![Kerberos Agent codespace](assets/img/codespace.png)

After a few minutes, you will see a beautiful `Visual Studio Code` shown in your browser, and you are ready to code!

![Kerberos Agent VSCode](assets/img/codespace-vscode.png)

On opening of the GitHub Codespace, some dependencies will be installed. Once this is done go ahead to the `ui/src/config.json` file, and (un)comment following section. Make sure to replace the `externalHost` variable with the DNS name you will retrieve from the next step.

    // Uncomment this when using codespaces or other special DNS names (which you can't control)
    // replace this with the DNS name of the kerberos agent server (the codespace url)
    const externalHost = 'cedricve-automatic-computing-machine-v647rxvj4whx9qp-80.preview.app.github.dev';

    const dev = {
      ENV: 'dev',
      HOSTNAME: externalHost,
      //API_URL: `${protocol}//${hostname}:80/api`,
      //URL: `${protocol}//${hostname}:80`,
      //WS_URL: `${websocketprotocol}//${hostname}:80/ws`,

      // Uncomment, and comment the above lines, when using codespaces or other special DNS names (which you can't control)
      API_URL: `${protocol}//${externalHost}/api`,
      URL: `${protocol}//${externalHost}`,
      WS_URL: `${websocketprotocol}//${externalHost}/ws`,
    };

Go and open two terminals one for the `ui` project and one for the `machinery` project.

1.  Terminal A:

        cd machinery/
        go run main.go -action run -port 80

2.  Terminal B:

        cd ui/
        yarn start

Once executed, a popup will show up mentioning `portforwarding`. You should see two ports being opened, one for the ui `3000` and one for the machinery `80`. `Right-click` on the port `80` and change visibility from `private` to `public`, this is required to avoid `CORS` errors.

![Codespace make public](./assets/img/codespace-make-public.png)

As mentioned above, copy the hostname of the `machinery` DNS name, and past it in the `ui/src/config.json` file. Once done reload, the `ui` page in your browser, and you should be able to access the login page with the default credentials `root` and `root`.

## Develop and build

Kerberos Agent is divided in two parts a `machinery` and `web`. Both parts live in this repository in their relative folders. For development or running the application on your local machine, you have to run both the `machinery` and the `web` as described below. When running in production everything is shipped as only one artifact, read more about this at [Building for production](#building-for-production).

### UI

The `web` is a **React** project which is the main entry point for an end user to view recordings, a livestream, and modify the configuration of the `machinery`.

    git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent
    cd ui
    yarn start

This will start a webserver and launches the web app on port `3000`.

![login-agent](./assets/img/agent-login.gif)

Once signed in you'll see the dashboard page showing up. After successfull configuration of your agent, you'll should see a live view and possible events recorded to disk.

![dashboard-agent](./assets/img/agent-dashboard.png)

### Machinery

The `machinery` is a **Golang** project which delivers two functions: it acts as the Kerberos Agent which is doing all the heavy lifting with camera processing and other kinds of logic, on the other hand it acts as a webserver (Rest API) that allows communication from the web (React) or any other custom application. The API is documented using `swagger`.

You can simply run the `machinery` using following commands.

    git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent
    cd machinery
    go run main.go -action run -port 80

This will launch the Kerberos Agent and run a webserver on port `80`. You can change the port by your own preference. We strongly support the usage of [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), as it comes with all the debugging and linting features builtin.

![VSCode desktop](./assets/img/vscode-desktop.png)

## Building from source

Running Kerberos Agent in production only require a single binary to run. Nevertheless, we have two parts, the `machinery` and the `web`, we merge them during build time. So this is what happens.

### UI

To build the Kerberos Agent web app, you simply have to run the `build` command of `yarn`. This will create a `build` directory inside the `web` directory, which contains a minified version of the React application. Other than that, we [also move](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/blob/master/web/package.json#L16) this `build` directory to the `machinery` directory.

    cd ui
    yarn build

### Machinery

Building the `machinery` is also super easy 🚀, by using `go build` you can create a single binary which ships it all; thank you Golang. After building you will endup with a binary called `main`, this is what contains everything you need to run Kerberos Agent.

Remember the build step of the `web` part, during build time we move the build directory to the `machinery` directory. Inside the `machinery` web server [we reference the](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/blob/master/machinery/src/routers/http/Server.go#L44) `build` directory. This makes it possible to just a have single web server that runs it all.

    cd machinery
    go build

## Building for Docker

Inside the root of this `agent` repository, you will find a `Dockerfile`. This file contains the instructions for building and shipping **Kerberos Agent**. Important to note is that start from a prebuild base image, `kerberos/base:xxx`.
This base image contains already a couple of tools, such as Golang, FFmpeg and OpenCV. We do this for faster compilation times.

By running the `docker build` command, you will create the Kerberos Agent Docker image. After building you can simply run the image as a Docker container.

    docker build -t kerberos/agent .

## What is new?

This repository contains the next generation of Kerberos.io, **Kerberos Agent (v3)**, and is the successor of the machinery and web repositories. A switch in technologies and architecture has been made. This version is still under active development and can be followed on the [develop branch](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/tree/develop) and [project overview](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent/projects/1).

## Why Kerberos?

As burglary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders, and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos Open Source goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have their own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

## Introduction

Kerberos Open Source is perfect for personal usage. It's great if you only have a couple of surveillance cameras to be managed. A Kerberos agent (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi or inside a Docker container) runs for each camera. Their are many different installation possibilities, please have a look at [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) or [**installation page**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation).

Every Kerberos agent has it's own web interface (front-end) to review media recording, and processing engine (back-end) of a specific surveillance camera. The Open Source version doesn't come with a central overview of all recordings generated by your Kerberos agents. For this feature we highly recommend Kerberos cloud.

If you want to manage more than 10 Kerberos agents, it's recommended to use [**Kerberos Enterprise**](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise). This will help you to scale, support high availability and load balancing. Check out [**the architecture**](https://doc.kerberos.io/architectures) section for a better understanding of when to use what.

## The web

The web is responsible for the visualization. It's a GUI which helps the user to find activity at a specific period, configure the machinery, view a live stream, see system information and much more.

It's written in PHP using the extremely popular PHP Framework Laravel, and Javascript using the client-side framework BackboneJS. We will discuss the different pages and functionality briefly. Please check out the demo environment if you want to see a real life example.

## How does it work?

[Read more](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/web) on our documentation website to have a better understanding of how the web works.

## Installation

Kerberos Open Source comes with different installation flavours (it includes both the machinery and web repository). The reason is because depending on the use case one option is better than another. A short list of recommendations:

- [**KiOS**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, and you only want to run a Kerberos agent on it.s
- [**Raspbian**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a Raspberry Pi, but you want other services running next to the Kerberos agent.
- [**Docker**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You have a lot of IP cameras, and/or don't want to mess with dependencies.
- [**Generic**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/installation): You want to develop/extend Kerberos with your own features, or you want to run a Kerberos agent on a not supported OS/architecture.

## Install from source

If you want to install **the web**, you'll need to have **a webserver** (e.g. Nginx) and **PHP** running with some extensions. You also need **NodeJS** and **npm** installed to install **Bower**. Below you can find the installation procedure to install the web on your preferred environment.

### Install Dependencies

Install Git, PHP7 (+extensions) and NodeJS.

A) Ubuntu

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
    sudo apt-get install git nginx php7.0-cli php7.0-gd php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-curl php7.0-mbstring php7.0-dom php7.0-zip php7.0-fpm nodejs npm

B) Raspbian

    echo ""deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ stretch main contrib non-free rpi"" | sudo tee --append /etc/apt/sources.list
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -t stretch php7.0 php7.0-curl php7.0-gd php7.0-fpm php7.0-cli php7.0-opcache php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-zip php7.0-mcrypt nodejs npm
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

C) OSX

    brew install php7.0 php7.0-curl php7.0-gd php7.0-fpm php7.0-cli php7.0-opcache php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-zip php7.0-mcrypt nodejs npm

### Configure webserver

Install Nginx,

    sudo apt-get install nginx

or if you're running OSX use brew.

    sudo brew install nginx

Creating a Nginx config.

    sudo rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Copy and paste following config file; this file tells nginx where the web will be installed and that it requires PHP.

    server
    {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        root /var/www/web/public;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name kerberos.rpi kerberos.rpi;
        index index.php index.html index.htm;

        location /
        {
                autoindex on;
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location ~ \.php$
        {
                fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
                fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
                include fastcgi_params;
        }
    }

### Clone source

Create a www location.

    mkdir -p /var/www

Get the source code from Github.

    cd /var/www && sudo git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/web && cd web

Install PHP packages by using composer.

    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php
    sudo mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer
    sudo composer install

Add write permission for the storage directory, and the kerberos config file.

    sudo chmod -R 777 storage
    sudo chmod -R 777 bootstrap/cache
    sudo chmod 777 config/kerberos.php

Install bower globally by using npm.

    sudo npm -g install bower

Install Front-end dependencies with bower

    cd public
    sudo bower --allow-root install

Restart nginx

    sudo service nginx restart

## How to access

You can access **the web** by entering the IP-address in your favorite browser. You'll see a welcome page showing up, on which you will be able to choose an username and password; the default username and password is **root**.

## Requirements
This work was implemented with the following frameworks:
* Spyder 3.2.x (recommended)
* Python 3.6.3
* Keras 2.0.6
* Tensorflow-gpu 1.1.0

## Usage
1. Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet_v2.git```

2. Download [CDnet2014](http://changedetection.net), [SBI2015](https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet) and [UCSD](https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet) datasets, then put them in the following directory structure:<br/>

    Example:

    ```
     FgSegNet_v2/
          scripts/FgSegNet_v2_CDnet.py
                 /FgSegNet_v2_SBI.py
                 /FgSegNet_v2_UCSD.py
                 /FgSegNet_v2_module.py
                 /instance_normalization.py
                 /my_upsampling_2d.py
		     /prediction_example.ipynb
		     
          datasets/
                  /CDnet2014_dataset/...
                  /SBI2015_dataset/...
                  /UCSD_dataset/...
		  
          training_sets/
                       /CDnet2014_train/...
                       /SBI2015_train/...
                       /UCSD_train20/...
                       /UCSD_train50/...
		       
	  testing_scripts/extract_mask.py
	  		 /thresholding.py
			 /python_metrics/...
    ```

3. Run the codes with **Spyder IDE**. Note that all trained models will be automatically saved (in current working directory) for you.

4. Here is how to extract foreground masks. Suppose your files are stored in the following dir structures:

```
     # Script file in the root dir
     extract_mask.py
     
     # Dataset downloaded from changedetection.net
     CDnet2014_dataset/baseline/...
     		      /cameraJitter/...
		      /badWeather/...
	
     # your trained model dir (models25 = models trained with 25 frames, (50frames, 200frames)
     FgSegNet_v2/models25/baseline/mdl_highway.h5
     				  /mdl_pedestrians.h5
				  ...
		         /cameraJitter/mdl_badminton.h5
			 	      /mdl_traffic.h5
				      /...
			/...
			 			
     
 ```
Go to Window cmd and run:


``` 
> python extract_mask.py 
```


> Your extracted frames will be automatically stored in ```FgSegNet_v2/results25/[CATEGORY_NAME]/[SCENE_NAME]/[binXXXXXX.png, ...]```

5. Threshold your foreground masks. Suppose that your extracted frames are stored in above folders. Go to cmd and run:

``` 
> python thresholding.py
```

> Your thresholded frames will be automatically stored in ```FgSegNet_v2/results25_th[0.X]/[CATEGORY_NAME]/[SCENE_NAME]/[binXXXXXX.png, ...]```


6. Remove training frames from your thresholded frames and evaluate your results.

## Evaluation
We evaluate our method using three different datasets as described in [here](https://github.com/lim-anggun/FgSegNet) or [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865518303702).

e.g.
``` 
> cd python_metrics
> python processFolder.py dataset_path root_path_of_thresholded_frames
```

This program uses an object detection deep learning model and a re-identification model to find and track the objects in a movie. Then, the program will track the trajectory of the objects and check if the objects cross the defined virtual lines or the objects are inside the defined areas. The program uses [Intel(r) Distribution of OpenVINO(tm) toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for deep learning inferencing.    
To track the objects, the program extracts the feature vectors from the objects which consists of 256 FP values with the re-identification DL model. The program can identify which object is most similar to the objects in the previous frame and record the trajectory. The L2 norm (or the distance) of those feature vectores represents the similarity of the objects. This program uses cosine distance to check the similarity between the objects.  
The line crossing check and area intrusion check are done by regular (meaning, non deep learning based) arithmetic algorithm.  
The latest version playbacks sound when an event such as crossing a line or entering to an area happens.  
You can learn how to use line-crossing and area intrusion function from simple test program (`test-line-cross-area-intrusion.py`)  

このプログラムはディープラーニングの物体検出モデルと特徴抽出(re-identification)モデルを用いて、ムービーフレーム中のオブジェクトを検出し、追跡するプログラムです。プログラムは見つけたオブジェクトの軌跡を記録し、オブジェクトが定義された仮想ラインを超えたり定義されたエリアに侵入したことを検出します。ディープラーニングの推論には[Intel(r) Distribution of OpenVINO(tm) toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit)を利用しています。  
オブジェクトの追跡のために、プログラムは特徴抽出モデルを使用して見つけたオブジェクトから256個の浮動小数点数値からなる特徴ベクトルを抽出します。この特徴ベクトル同士のL2ノルム(=距離)がオブジェクト同士の類似度を表します。このプログラムではノルムの計算にコサイン距離を使用しています。  
ラインクロスとエリア侵入の判定には通常の(ディープラーニングベースではない)数学的アルゴリズムを使用しています。  
最新版はラインクロスしたりエリア侵入したりなどのイベント発生時にオーディオを再生します。  
コードを簡素化したテストプログラムも追加しました。ライン交差やエリア侵入判定関数の使い方などを学ぶことが可能です。(`test-line-cross-area-intrusion.py`)  

[ Update - 04-Apr-2022 ] OpenVINO API 2.0 support. Program is now compatible with OpenVINO 2022.1 (and not compatible with OpenVINO 2021 and older ones)

## License

The Kerberos Open Source project is licensed with BY-NC-SA 4.0, this means that everyone can use Kerberos and modify if to their needs, in a non commercial activity.

More information [**about this license**](https://doc.kerberos.io/opensource/license).

## Why Kerberos?

As burglary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders, and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos Open Source goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have their own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

# Docker

A Docker image (x86, ARMv7, ARMv8) is available on [**the Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/r/kerberos/kerberos), which contains all the necessary software to setup the Kerberos agent. Before you can run this image you will have to make sure [**Docker**](https://docker.com) is installed. After the installation you can use **docker run** to get the Kerberos agent up and running; you can also opt for **dockeros** to create and scale your Kerberos agents.

## Use docker run

After you've installed Docker, you can open a command prompt and type in following command. This will pull the kerberos image and make the web interface available on port 80 and the livestream on port 8889. You can give the container a custom name using the **--name** property.

    docker run --name camera1 -p 80:80 -p 8889:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos
    docker run --name camera2 -p 81:80 -p 8890:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos
    docker run --name camera3 -p 82:80 -p 8891:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos

## Or use dockeros (our docker creation tool)

We've created a simple and small tool to auto provision and auto configure the Kerberos agents. The idea is that you define the different configurations for every camera upfront (/environments directory), and map them to into your Docker container (using volumes). The ultimate goal is to have a fully automated for provisioning your Kerberos agents in just a matter of seconds. It's also a great way to backup your security configuration.

    CAMERA 1 <<== CONTAINER1 <<== environment/cameraconfig1
    CAMERA 2 <<== CONTAINER2 <<== environment/cameraconfig2
    CAMERA 3 <<== CONTAINER2 <<== environment/cameraconfig3

### How to use it?

The tool we've created is a simple bash script which we called **dockeros**, and exposes a couple of methods; discussed below. By specifying a number of parameters, **dockeros** will do all the magic dockering for you. This tool is still work in progress, so PR's and new features are welcome!

    git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/docker
    cd docker/bin
    ./dockeros.sh {command}

### Commands

List all kerberos.io containers which are created.

    ./dockeros.sh showall


Remove all kerberos.io containers which were created before.

    ./dockeros.sh cleanup

Create a kerberos.io container with a name and predefined configuration.

    ./dockeros.sh create {name} {config} {webport} {streamport}

* **name**: This is the name of the container which will be created.

* **config**: The configuration which needs to be injected in the container. The configuration directories can be found in the **/environments** folder.

* **webport**: The port on which the webinterface will be served.

* **streamport**: The port on which the livestream will be served.

Optical Flow Dataset and Evaluation Kit for Visual Crowd Analysis developed at [Communication Systems Group](https://www.nue.tu-berlin.de/) at TU-Berlin desciribed in the AVSS 2018 paper 
[Optical Flow Dataset and Benchmark for Visual Crowd Analysis](http://elvera.nue.tu-berlin.de/files/1548Schr%C3%B6der2018.pdf) or [TUBCrowdFlow@arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07170). 

The Dataset contains 10 sequences showing 5 scenes. Each scene is rendered twice: with a static point of view and a dynamic camera to simulate drone/UAV based surveillance. We render at HD resolution (1280x720) at 25 fps, which is typical for current commercial CCTV surveillance systems. The total number of frames 3200.

For each sequence we provide the following **ground-truth** data:
 * **Optical flow fields** 
 * **Person trajectories (up to 1451)**
 * **Dense pixel trajectories**

### Installation
Minimum required python version: 3.5

**Install dependencies on Ubuntu:**
```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-virtualenv virtualenv
```
Create a virtual environment and install python requirements:
```
virtualenv -p python3 crowdflow_env
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
pip3 install numpy progressbar2 opencv-contrib-python
```

## Evaluation Framework
To evaluate an optical flow method with the providen framework perform these step:
 * create a new directory in the `/TUBCrowdFlow/estimate` directory. 
 * compute flow fields and save them in *.flo* fileformat with the structure given in by the 
 `/TUBCrowdFlow/images` directory.  For example optical flow results from the image pair  `/TUBCrowdFlow/images/IM01/frame_0000.png` and `/TUBCrowdFlow/images/IM01/frame_0001.png`
 must be stored as `/estimate/[mymethod]/images/IM01/frame_0000.flo
 * run `opticalflow_evaluate.py` to compute EPE and R2 short-term metrics.
 * run `trajectory_evaluate.py` to compute tracking accuracy long-term metrics.

**Optical Flow Samples**

`
opticalflow_estimate.py <dataset_root_path> <flow_method_name_1> <flow_method_name_2> ...
`

With the following program optical flow fields for the TUB CrowdFlow dataset will be estimated with Dual-TVL1.
```
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
python3 opticalflow_estimate.py TUBCrowdFlow/ dual farneback plk
```
The optical flow files will be stored in the directory `/estimate/dual/` . 

**Short-Term Evaluation**

Short-term evaluation performs classical approch for optical flow evaluation, i.e. measures based on ground-truth optical flow fields (e.g. end-point error, RX measures)

`
opticalflow_evaluate.py <dataset_root_path> <dir_name_method_1> <dir_name_method_2> ... <dir_name_method_n> 
`

Example:
```
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
python3 opticalflow_evaluate.py TUBCrowdFlow/ dual plk farneback
```
After execution the file *short_term_results.tex* will contain the evaluation results (*method 1 - method n*) in form of a latex table.
*short_term_results.pb* will contain the evaluation results stored with pickle.

**Long-Term  Evaluation**

Long-term evaluation performs evaluation based on ground-truth trajectories, i.e. **person trajectories** and **dense pixel trajectories** (see paper).

`
trajectory_evaluate.py <dataset_root_path> <dir_name_method_1> <dir_name_method_2> ... <dir_name_method_n>
`

Example:
```
source crowdflow_env/bin/activate
python3 trajectory_evaluate.py TUBCrowdFlow/ dual plk farneback 
```
After execution the file *long_term_results.tex* will contain the evaluation results (*method 1 - method n*) in form of a latex table.
*long_term_results.pb* will contain the evaluation results stored with pickle.

## Results
To assess the quality of the optical flow we propose to use two types of metrics: i) common optical flow metrics, i.e. average endpoint error (EPE) and percentage of erroneous
pixel (RX) and ii) long-term motion metrics based on trajectories. An detailed overview of the optical flow parameters can be found in the document: [Supplemental_materials.pdf](./Supplemental_material.pdf)).

# Computer Vision Sandbox

Computer Vision Sandbox is a software package, which aims to allow solving different tasks related to computer vision areas, like, for example, video surveillance, vision based automation/robotics, different sorts of image/video processing, etc.

The idea of the software is its great modularity. The main application itself does little on its own - it represents a building platform. However, being combined with the vast range of plug-ins it may accomplish great range of tasks. Plug-ins represent building blocks and the type of blocks chosen and the way those are used determine what the software does. The idea is to provide users with a building platform and let them construct their goal.

So, what are the plug-ins? Since it is all around computer vision, the video source plug-ins play the central role in the system. There are plug-ins to access different types of cameras, like USB web cameras, video capture boards, IP video surveillance cameras, etc. Once video is received, there is great variety of plug-ins to perform different image and video processing. Combined together those allow achieving many interesting results. On top of that, there is scripting support, which allows to do even more by programming custom scripts utilizing the variety of plug-ins. Future releases will extend scripting API even more, bring more image/video processing plug-ins and introduce device plug-ins to talk to some robotics boards/controllers and other hardware - this is when the real fun comes.

So, to repeat, it is all about building blocks and connecting them to solve the task. And if the system does not talk to certain camera model, does not perform some required image or video processing, etc. - add a plug-in and it will do so. Well, this is the goal. 

Below is a quick screen shot of the Computer Vision Sandbox showing six different IP cameras:
![Cameras View](images/cvsandbox.jpg)

Another one from a different area - locating and counting objects of different colors:

## ABOUT

A header-only **C++** library which wraps [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [V4L2](https://linuxtv.org/), [ALSA](https://www.alsa-project.org) and [Libevent](http://libevent.org/) for capturing audio and video from multiple live sources (cameras and microphones) and

* Encoding (video: **H264**, audio: **AAC**, **MP2** and **OPUS**)
* Decoding (video: **MJPEG**) / transcoding (video: **MJPEG** -> **H264**)
* Recording to file (**MPEGTS** and **MATROSKA** containers, audio and/or video)
* Streaming (**HTTP** and **UDP** protocols for **MPEGTS** and **MATROSKA** containers)
* Basic image processing

The project is useful for building **video surveillance** systems as well, consisting in media servers which stream and record at the same time and which can be controlled through **MQTT** or **HTTP** commands (see **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/mqtt-avsystem/README.md)** and **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/examples/VideoExample_2.cpp)** examples).

The project runs on **Linux** (**ALSA** and **V4L2** devices), but a Windows port is planned (any contribution is welcome!).

## FEATURES

* All the audio/video tasks are made with **strictly asynchronous** multiple **pipes**, inside one main loop. This allows to create **simple**, **short** (a complete live H264 grabber/streamer can be made with less than 40 lines of code, see **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/examples/VideoExample_1.cpp)** example), **easy to read** and **intuitive** code in which all the pipes can be realized through overloaded operators, in the following form:

```
while (!LAAVStop)
{
    // Pipe
    grabber >> converter >> encoder >> streamer;
    
    // Audio-video events catcher
    eventsCatcher->catchNextEvent();
}
```

* **Threads are not used at all** and they are intentionally discouraged in order to avoid that they can be improperly used for decoupling tasks, without taking advantage from multi-core systems.
* All the audio/video modules (-> classes) make **extensive use of templates** and all their possible concatenations are checked at **compile-time**, so to avoid inconsistent pipes.
* All the pipes are **safe at runtime**. I.E: when a source is disconnected or temporarily unavailable, the main loop can continue without necessarily having to check errors (they can be checked, anyway, by polling the status of each node: see **[THIS](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/blob/master/examples/AudioVideoExample_2.cpp)** example)
* The library is all RAII-designed (basically it safely wraps Libavcodec/format, V4L and ALSA) and **the user doesn't have to bother with pointers and memory management**.
* The public API is intended to be intuitive, with a few self-explanatory functions.

## COMPILING / RUNNING

Dependencies: **[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** >= **5.0** (tested with **5.0** version), **[Libevent](http://libevent.org/)** and pkg-config (optional: see the compile command below).
**[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)** needs **[x264](http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html)** for H264 support and **[libopus](http://opus-codec.org/)** for OPUS support.

* Include the library global header (LAAV.hpp), as shown in the [examples](https://github.com/paolo-pr/laav/tree/master/examples), in YourProgram.cpp and execute:
```
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -DLINUX -o YourProgram YourProgram.cpp `pkg-config --libs libavformat libavcodec libavutil libswresample libswscale libevent alsa`

The library has been tested with the **[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/)**, **[FFPLAY](https://ffmpeg.org/)** and **[MPV](https://mpv.io/)** media players, but other players should work as well.
In order to reduce the network streams' latency, use the following flags on the client side:

VLC (tested with v2.2.4: set a low value for --network-caching flag):
```
vlc --network-caching 200 http://stream_url
```
FFPLAY:
```
ffplay -fflags nobuffer http://stream_url
```

## New for Release 1.4.1

Much has changed over the past 4+ years since the 1.3.1 stable release of **DMS<sup>3</sup>**, so this release has focused on upgrades and improvements to make the **DMS<sup>3</sup>** surveillance security system that so many people have relied upon even more efficient, stable, and secure.

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail**

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10182110/150719391-a562ac4a-154e-4dad-b4bc-6c88f4d2b425.png"" alt=""DMS3Mail Event"">
</p>

- The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** component gets a significant makeover in response to ongoing changes in the use of advanced progressive HTML5 email templates developed to work with myriad end-user email applications. Upgrades to **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** include:
  - **NEW!** A much-anticipated and fully configurable HTML5 email template, based on the very popular [Cerberus responsive email patterns](https://github.com/TedGoas/Cerberus). For use in **DMS<sup>3</sup>**, we integrated the [Go HTML/template package](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) into the Cerberus fluid template, very similar to what we did when creating the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component. This new responsive email template now presents a more complete email message to the end user, with the following functionality:
    - **NEW!** Larger image attachments are now integrated directly into the email body (versus as an attachment)
    - **NEW!** More complete metrics now presented in the email for each security event, including the hostname of the **DMS<sup>3</sup> Client** component sourcing the event.
    - **NEW!** The percentage of changes (in pixels) is now provided, thanks to a new *GetImageDimensions()* routine that provides image details as **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** processes the security event in real-time.
    - As part of this new progressive email template, email ""dark mode"" is now handled automatically, making it easier to view email on disparate mobile platforms

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard**

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10182110/150717902-8eca508a-f107-4b24-87e6-022dde20196a.png"" alt=""DMS3Dashboard Display"">
</p>

Ever wonder if your surveillance cameras are operational, in need of updates, or even a reboot? The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component can be enabled to run on a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** and provide regularly-updated information of all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components with device metrics that include:

- Hostname
- Hardware platform and operating system
- Kernel version
- Current **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** and all reporting **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components' uptime
- Count of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** reporting to the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**
- Count of surveillance events generated by **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** components
- Date/time (ISO 8601) the component last reported to the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**

Additionally, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** provides a quick visual health check of all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components, using color-sensitive component icons, where:

- <span style=""color:green"">**Green**</span>: a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** has reported to the server within an expected period of time (as configured)
- <span style=""color:orange"">**Yellow**</span>: a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** is late in reporting, exceeding its configured reporting interval
- <span style=""color:red"">**Red**</span>: a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** has not reported to the server, and requires attention

The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component is written using [Go's HTML templating package](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template), making it very easy to integrate new or existing HTML template themes into the component. The template used by **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** is based largely on the following resources:

- [Creative Tim's Paper Dashboard Theme](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/paper-dashboard)
- Fonts provided by [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/)

New for this release are the following additional configuration options for **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard**:

- **NEW!** Independently configurable client icon status option timeouts (warning, danger, missing) visually provide a status of a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** health in real-time
- **NEW!** Option to make **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** always first in the set of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** devices displayed in the dashboard
- **NEW!** Option to alphabetically sort **DMS<sup>3</sup>** devices displayed in the dashboard
- **NEW!** Reporting a more comprehensive--and now dynamically updated--list of **DMS<sup>3</sup>** device attributes, including:
  - Operating system name and version release (*e.g.,* Raspbian GNU/Linux 10)
  - Hardware platform (*e.g.,* Linux ARM7l)
  - Kernel release (*e.g.,* 5.10.63-v7+)
- **NEW!** Various additional upgrades to the dashboard HTML template, including revisions to the template display, and updates to use the new **DMS<sup>3</sup>** logo in the template header

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** & **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**
  
- Both of these **DMS<sup>3</sup>** components received a significant upgrade that includes:
  - A revision to the **DMS<sup>3</sup>** component codebase, moving from [Go 1.8 to Go 1.17](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release), bringing with this language release update numerous new low-level packages, platform performance optimizations, and security enhancements
  - The addition of the ARM8 platform type (great news for Raspberry Pi and related SBC users), automatically incorporated into our native **DMS<sup>3</sup>Build** process
    - As part of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Build** process, the remote installers have been rewritten to abstract away specific Linux dependencies
  - Revised overall project structure to reflect idiomatic Go principles
    - Commands now organized into a `cmd` folder, while configuration files are now managed in a `config` folder
    - Project moved from use of the `gocode` process to using `gopls`
    - Project migration over to the use of [Go modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod)
  - System-level service (daemon) calls are now abstracted away to work on across a broader array of Unix-like operating systems
  - **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** listening port moved from the previous registered port range into the more appropriate dynamic/private range
  - All [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) configuration files revved from 0.4.0 and validated ([tomlv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/toml/tree/master/cmd/tomlv)) to 1.0.0

**Distributed Motion Surveillance Security System (DMS<sup>3</sup>)** is a [Go-based](https://golang.org/ ""Go"") application that integrates third-party open-source motion detection applications (*e.g.*, the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detection software package, or [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/ ""OpenCV""), the Open Source Computer Vision Library) into a distributed motion surveillance system that:

- Senses when someone is ""at home"" and when someone is ""not at home"" and **automatically enables or disables the surveillance system**
- Through the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**, coordinates video stream processing, reporting, and user notification to capable ""smart"" device clients, running the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component (*e.g.*, a Raspberry Pi) which:
  - Greatly minimizes network congestion, *particularly during high-bandwidth surveillance events of interest*
  - Better utilizes smart device client CPU/GPU processing power: keeping stream processing ""on-board"" and distributed around the network
- Optionally, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** can report events of interest via email using the available **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** component
- Optionally, the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** can display the current state of all reporting **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** visually through the use of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component
- Works cooperatively with legacy ""less smart"" device clients such as IP cameras (wired or WiFi), webcams, and other USB camera devices

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Features

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**, and **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** Features

- Support for the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard** component, allowing for the easy, visual monitoring of all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** devices managed by a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component
  - Mobile first, responsive, web-based design
  - Uses [Go's HTML templating package](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) to simplify Go/HTML integration
  - Easily integrate 3rd-party configurable HTML website templates

- Automated starting/stopping of any number of motion detection applications installed on smart device clients (*e.g.*, the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detector software package) based on the presence/absence of user proxy devices

- *Always On* feature starts/stops the motion detection application based on time-of-day (*e.g*., can enable video surveillance during nighttime or specific holiday hours)
- Device clients can be custom-configured to process and respond to surveillance events independently and uniquely (*e.g.*, an outdoor IR camera device only sends email during nighttime hours)
- Optionally play separate audio file(s) on surveillance system enable and disable
- Configurable event logging
  - INFO, ERROR, FATAL, and DEBUG log levels
  - Persist logs to file or send to STDOUT (terminal)
- [MAC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address ""MAC address"") (Layer 2) address sensing
  - IPv4 protocol support
  - IPv6 protocol support [planned]
- Bluetooth user proxy sensing (using RSSI, L2CAP, or similar) [planned]

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** Features

- Developed for use exclusively with [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""), **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is an automated, real-time email notification service triggered by [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"")-generated detection events

  - Fully configurable email message subject, body, *etc.* using the excellent [Cerberus](https://github.com/TedGoas/Cerberus) responsive HTML email template
  - Optionally attach an event image or video to an email message
  - SMTP-support for compatibility with most web-mail services (*e.g.*, [Gmail](http://gmail.com ""Google Gmail""))
  - Configurable event logging
    - INFO, ERROR, FATAL, and DEBUG log levels
    - Persist logs to file or send to STDOUT (terminal)

### Motion Detection Application Support

While **DMS<sup>3</sup>** is primarily responsible for monitoring user proxies and determining when to enable or disable the surveillance system, *it alone does not manage the processing of video stream data*. That complex real-time task is left to motion detection libraries/applications which can be integrated directly into **DMS<sup>3</sup>**.

- Support for the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detector software package

  - Movement detection support of video devices. See [this list](https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/wiki/Supported-hardware ""Device Compatibility"") for video device compatibility. Note that **DMS<sup>3</sup>** was developed and tested using smart device clients running [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") with native camera support (*e.g.*, a Raspberry Pi with an on-board camera module)

- Support for the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/ ""Open Source Computer Vision Library"") Library [planned]

  - [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/ ""Open Source Computer Vision Library"") support is highly anticipated, but still experimental, though the current **DMS<sup>3</sup>** codebase cleanly abstracts away any specific motion detection application dependencies so it is anticipated to be a very straightforward integration

### Support for ""Smart"" and ""Less Smart"" Device Clients

**DMS<sup>3</sup>** is designed to utilize intelligent IoT devices, called **Smart Device Clients (SDCs)**, while still supporting less intelligent, single-purpose devices, called **Less Smart Device Clients (LSDCs)**.

- **DMS<sup>3</sup> Smart Device Clients (SDCs)** are hardware devices capable of processing local video streams for motion detection on-board, with dedicated hardware. Most computers and smaller single board computers (IoT SBCs) would be classed as smart device clients, including:
  - Raspberry PIs (**DMS<sup>3</sup>** was tested with the RaspPi Model 2, Model 3, and Pi Zero W) with a configured on-board camera module
  - Any IoT single board computer (SBC) capable of running a Unix-like operating system
  - Personal computers with a camera and wired or wireless (WiFi) connectivity

- **DMS<sup>3</sup> Less Smart Device Clients (LSDCs)** are hardware devices--typically purpose-built--unable to process motion detection video streams locally. These devices usually generate raw real-time video data, which is then sent, consumed and processed by an external device(s), oftentimes wirelessly across a network. Some examples of LSDCs include:

  - IP cameras (*e.g.*, the [Nest Cam](https://nest.com/cameras/ ""Google Nest"")), either wired or wireless
  - Webcams, typically using USB connections and run from a laptop or desktop computer

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Use Cases

### ""Leaving Home, Coming Home""

At its core, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** sensing relies on the concept of a *user proxy*. In this context, *a user proxy is any device representing a user that can be sensed on a home network*. A smartphone is an excellent user proxy, assuming that a user's smartphone is active on the home network when the user is ""at home,"" and drops from the network when the user leaves and is then ""not at home.""

This concept can extend to multiple user proxies, making it possible for **DMS<sup>3</sup>** to keep a surveillance system disabled until everyone in an entire family has left home: once the last registered user proxy is no longer sensed on the home network, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** automatically enables the surveillance system.

The reverse is true as well: **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will keep the surveillance system enabled only until the first user proxy is seen on the home network (*e.g.,* someone pulling into the driveway), at which time **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will automatically disable the surveillance system.

### ""Nighttime Surveillance""

In addition to sensing user proxies, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** can be configured to keep a surveillance system enabled for a specific periods of time. Called *Always On*, this **DMS<sup>3</sup>** feature works as an override for sensing user proxies: regardless of whether **DMS<sup>3</sup>** senses a user proxy on the network, as long as the time-of-day policy is met, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will enable the surveillance system.

This feature is particularly useful for nighttime surveillance, when users may be asleep and/or smartphones may be turned off. For example, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** can be configured to turn a surveillance system on at 2330, and stay on until 0500 the next morning. During this time, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** will remain operational and monitor (and report) surveillance events as they occur.

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Components

**DMS<sup>3</sup>** is organized into the following application components:

- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**: integrated server-side system services that determine whether to enable/disable the surveillance system, and regularly notifies participating **DMS<sup>3</sup>** device clients of that surveillance state. A **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** is typically instantiated on a headless server or home desktop computer
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**: client-side endpoint services that start/stop the locally-installed motion detection application (*e.g.*, [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"")). Any number of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** clients can exist as part of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>** surveillance system. **DMS<sup>3</sup>Clients** are typically installed on IoT hardware (*e.g.,* Raspberry PI or similar SBC devices)
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Dashboard**: an optional component that permits for the visual display and real-time status of **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** components through a web browser
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Libs**: a set of related shared libraries used for managing **DMS<sup>3</sup>** client-server services including low-level system and networking commands, system logging, and unit testing

Optional for smart device clients configured to use the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detection application:

- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail**: a separate, configurable **DMS<sup>3</sup>** component for generating and sending an email in real-time whenever a client running [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") generates a significant security event

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Architecture

**DMS<sup>3</sup>** is patterned after a [client server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model ""client server model""), where the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component is centrally responsible for the logic of enabling/disabling the video surveillance system, while each participating smart device client (SDC), through the use of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component, is responsible for starting/stopping the locally-installed motion detection application. For ""less smart"" device clients (LSDCs), the processing of video stream data is passed over the wire to the server for processing and eventual system response and/or user notification.

In the example presented at the start of this document, one IP camera device, one IoT SBC device (a Raspberry Pi), and one webcam device are managed through the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component (using the [TCP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol ""TCP protocol"")). The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** determines when to enable/disable the surveillance system, and notifies each participating device client running their own local instance of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component. Since the Raspberry Pi can be configured to run a local instance of a motion detection application, actual video stream processing, imaging, and eventual reporting is all done locally, greatly limiting network congestion.

The webcam device and the IP camera device--both less smart device clients (LSDCs), incapable of on-board stream processing--must pass raw stream data along to a device proxy running a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component, which then applies motion detection processing on the incoming video streams.

## How **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Works

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** Operation

The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component is responsible for signaling the logic of enabling/disabling the video surveillance system to all device client endpoints. That is, the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** sends either a `Start` or a `Stop` message to all **DMS<sup>3</sup>** device clients configured with a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component, listening on the network.

**DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** does this by periodically scanning the network for the existence of registered user proxies. This device can be anything that exposes its MAC address on the network (*e.g.,* a mobile phone on a home LAN). If that device is found on the network, it's assumed that ""someone is home"" and so **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** sends out a `Stop` message to all participating device clients, and their respective motion detection application is subsequently stopped (if currently running).

If that user proxy then ""leaves"" and is no longer found on the network, it's assumed that ""nobody is home"", and the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** sends out a `Start` message to all participating device clients, and the motion detection application on that client is started (if currently stopped). Similar logic is used in the reverse case: when a user proxy is once again ""back home,"" the motion detection application of each device client is signalled to `Stop`.

Alternatively, the *Always On* feature uses time-of-day to enable/disable the surveillance system. The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** will look at the time range specified, and if the current time falls between the time range, the motion detection application of all client devices will be started. Once the current time falls outside of the specified time range, the motion detection application for each device client is then stopped.

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** Operation

#### Running on Smart Device Clients (SDCs)

The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** component runs on each configured smart device client endpoint, and is responsible for starting/stopping its locally installed motion detection application. The **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** does this by periodically listening to the configured **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** at the pre-configured IP address and port (network socket address). When the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** receives a change in motion detection application state, it either starts or stops its locally-installed motion detection application.

#### Running with Less Smart Device Clients (LSDCs)

In instances where the device client is ""less smart"" and unable to process motion detection in local video streams, an LSDC instead passes motion detection processing to a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** proxy. Multiple LSDCs can be served by a single **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** proxy. This proxy is then responsible for the operations of a typical **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**.

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** / **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** Work Flow

Operationally, the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** and all **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** device clients work together to establish a synchronized video surveillance state across all endpoints:

- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**: usually configured as a daemon running on a central server, walks a logic tree whenever a client connects (or re-connects) to the server. **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** is responsible for answering the question *""should the surveillance system be enabled or disabled right now?""*
- **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client**: usually configured as a daemon that runs on each of the participating smart device clients, a **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** regularly polls (at a configurable interval) the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**, and receives from the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** the current motion detection application state (called *MotionDetectorState*), that is, whether the locally installed motion detection application should be started or stopped

The activity diagram below shows the work flow of these two components:

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10182110/150865977-cd236155-923a-47de-9d76-ff2052b3c11d.png"" alt=""DMS3 Activity Diagram"">
</p>

### **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** Operation

When using [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""), **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is a feature written for **DMS<sup>3</sup>** that allows for the creation and sending an email whenever a valid capture event is triggered in [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""). **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is very tightly integrated into [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""), where image and video capture events are identified, analyzed, and processed. **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is triggered by the  [`on_picture_save`](https://motion-project.github.io/motion_config.html#on_picture_save) and the [`on_movie_end`](https://motion-project.github.io/motion_config.html#on_movie_end) commands in [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"").

> **Note:** the optional **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** component is called by neither **DMS<sup>3</sup>Client** nor **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server**. Instead, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** is called directly by the [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") motion detection application.

The syntax for these [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") commands are:

```text
<on_picture_save|on_movie_end> <absolute path to dms3mail> -pixels=%D -filename=%f
```

Once configured, **DMS<sup>3</sup>Mail** will respond to these two [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"") event [hooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking ""Hooking""), and an email will be generated and sent out with an image file or video clip capturing the surveillance event of interest.

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Requirements

- In order to compile the **DMS<sup>3</sup>** project components, an operational Go environment is required (this version of **DMS<sup>3</sup>** was developed using Go 1.17)
- A Unix-like operating system installed on the server and smart device client (SDC) endpoints
- While **DMS<sup>3</sup>** was written and tested under Linux (Ubuntu 17.04+, and various Debian and Raspian releases), there should be no reason why **DMS<sup>3</sup>** won't work under other Linux distributions
- A motion detection application, such as [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion""), correctly installed and configured with appropriate video devices configured on all smart device clients
- Specific Unix and Unix-like commands and tools used by **DMS<sup>3</sup>** components include:
  - [aplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplay ""aplay""): ALSA audio player (optional)
  - [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) ""bash""): a Unix shell and command language
  - [cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_(Unix) ""cat""): a standard Unix utility that reads files/input and writes them to standard output
  - [env](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env ""env""): Unix shell command to run a program in an altered environment
  - [grep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep ""grep""): globally search a regular expression and print
  - [ip](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ip ""ip""): displays or manipulate routing, devices, policy routing, and tunnels

### Wifi MAC Randomization Techniques

At its core, **DMS<sup>3</sup>** sensing relies on the concept of a *user proxy*. In this context, *a user proxy is any device representing a user that can be sensed on a home network*. A smartphone is an excellent user proxy, assuming that a user's smartphone is active on the home network when the user is ""at home,"" and drops from the network when the user leaves and is then ""not at home."" **DMS<sup>3</sup>** performs this sensing by searching the end user's network for MAC addresses registered during the configuration of the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component (in the `dms3server.toml` file).

Historically, MAC addresses have always represented, 1-for-1, the underlying hardware. However, more recently, and as a broader privacy policy, some device vendors now provide users the option to have their device generate MAC addresses randomly for over-the-air communications. This feature can disrupt the sensing services used by the **DMS<sup>3</sup>Server** component.

As a result, it's important to review your smartphone (or other user proxies) privacy policies and feature options and configure it accordingly.

## **DMS<sup>3</sup>** Installation

## License

To use Kerberos Hub a license is required. This license will grant access the Kerberos Hub API, and allow to connect a number of cameras and Kerberos Vaults. Request a license at `support@kerberos.io`.

## Installation

The Kerberos Hub service has several dependencies, as described below. Different components needs to be installed and are leveraged by Kerberos Hub to store data (MongoDB), bi-directional communication (MQTT/Vernemq), etc. Each of these services are installed through the concept of Helm charts. Once all dependencies are installed you will see that Kerberos Hub itself is [also installed through the Kerberos Hub helm chart](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/hub).

## What's in the repo?

This repo describes how to install Kerberos Hub inside your own Kubernetes cluster (or [K3S cluster](https://k3s.io/)) using a Helm chart.

A couple of dependencies need to be installed first:

- A message broker ([RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) or others)
- an event broker ([Vernemq](https://vernemq.com/))
- a database ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)),
- and a TURN server ([Pion](https://github.com/pion/turn))

Next to that one can use an Nginx ingress controller or Traefik for orchestrating the ingresses, however this is all up to you. Once all dependencies are installed, the appropriate values [should be updated in the Kerberos Hub `values.yaml`](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/hub/values.yaml) file.

We do manage certificates through cert-manager and letsencrypt, and rely on HTTP01 and DNS01 resolvers. So you might need to change that for your custom scenarion (e.g. on premise deployment).

![hub-dashboard](assets/images/hub-dashboard.gif)

# What are we building?

As shown below you will find the architecture of what we are going to install (the green rectangle).

![hub-architecture](assets/images/hub-deployment.png)

# Prerequisites

## Add helm repos

The Kerberos Hub installation makes use a couple of other charts which are shipped within their on Helm repos. Therefore, we will add those repos to our Kubernetes cluster.

    helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
    helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
    helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
    helm repo add vernemq https://vernemq.github.io/docker-vernemq
    helm repo add kerberos https://charts.kerberos.io
    helm repo update

## Cert manager

We rely on cert-manager and letsencrypt for generating all the certificates we'll need for the Kerberos Hub web interface, Kerberos Hub api and the Vernemq broker (WSS/TLS).

As a best practice we will install all the dependencies in their own namespace. Let's start by creating a separate namespace for cert-manager.

    kubectl create namespace cert-manager

Install the cert-manager helm chart into that namespace.

    helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --set installCRDs=true

If you already have the CRDs install you could get rid of `--set installCRDs=true`.

Next we will install a cluster issuer that will make the HTTP01 challenges, this is needed for resolving the certificates of both Kerberos Hub web interface and api.

    kubectl apply -f cert-manager/cluster-issuer.yaml

## Optional - Rancher

A great way to manage your cluster through a UI is Rancher. This is totally up to you, but we love to use it a Kerberos.io

    helm repo add rancher-latest https://releases.rancher.com/server-charts/latest
    helm repo update
    kubectl create namespace cattle-system
    helm install rancher rancher-latest/rancher \
    --namespace cattle-system \
    --set hostname=rancher.kerberos.xxx \
    --set ingress.tls.source=letsEncrypt \
    --set letsEncrypt.email=xxx@email.com \
    --set 'extraEnv[0].name=CATTLE_TLS_MIN_VERSION' \
    --set 'extraEnv[0].value=1.2'

## Message broker or queue

To integrate, scale and make Kerberos Hub more resilient the Kerberos Hub pipeline is using a message broker (or queue) to provide a resilient message flow. The message broker integrates the different micro services you'll find in Kerberos Hub, and allow you to scale specific services independently. As of now we suppor two main messages brokers: RabbitMQ and Kafka. Depending on your current solution landscape and/or skills you might prefer one over the other.

### RabbitMQ (preferred)

RabbitMQ is the preferred message broker, as it's easy to setup, scale and comes with high availability out of the box. RabbitMQ will distribute messages to the different consumer (microservices).

As a best practice let's create another namespace.

    kubectl create namespace rabbitmq

Before installing [the RabbitMQ helm chart,](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/rabbitmq) make sure to have a look at the `rabbitmq/values.yaml` file. This includes different variables such as `username`, `password`, `replicaCount` and more. Change those settings for your own preference or usecase.

    helm install rabbitmq bitnami/rabbitmq -n rabbitmq -f rabbitmq/values.yaml

You might need to add a few CRD's. If you see following error, `unable to recognize """": no matches for kind ""ServiceMonitor"" in version ""monitoring.coreos.com/v1`.

    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml

### or Kafka

Kafka is used for the Kerberos Pipeline, this is the place where microservices are executed in parallel and/or sequentially. These microservices will receive events from a Kafka topic and then process the recording, and it's metadata. Results are injected back into Kafka and passed on to the following microservices. Microservices are independently horizontal scalable through replicas, this means that you can distribute your workload across your nodes if a specific microservice requires that.

As a best practice let's create another namespace.

    kubectl create namespace kafka

Before installing the Kafka helm chart, go and have a look in the kafka/values.yaml file. You should update the clientUsers and clientPasswords. Have a look at the zookeeper credentials as well and update accordingly. Make sure to install version 18.4.4, as this `values.yaml` is matched for that specific helm release.

    helm install kafka bitnami/kafka -f ./kafka/values.yaml -n kafka  --version 20.0.2

## Event broker

Next to a message broker, we are using an event broker (MQTT) for bidirectional communication in the Kerberos Hub ecosystem.

### Vernemq

This Vernemq broker, which is horizontal scalable, allows communicating with Kerberos agents at the edge (or wherever they live) and Kerberos Vault to forward recordings from the edge into the cloud.

We'll create a namespace for our event broker Vernemq.

    kubectl create namespace vernemq

Create a certificate, so we can handle TLS/WSS. (this needs a DNS challenge)

    kubectl apply -f vernemq/vernemq-secret.yaml --namespace cert-manager
    kubectl apply -f vernemq/vernemq-issuer.yaml --namespace vernemq
    kubectl apply -f vernemq/vernemq-certificate.yaml --namespace vernemq

By default, a username and password is set for the Vernemq broker. You can find these in the `vernemq/values.yaml` file [as shown below](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub/blob/master/vernemq/values.yaml#L216-L217).

    ...
    - name: DOCKER_VERNEMQ_USER_YOURUSERNAME
    value: ""yourpassword""
    ...

Please note that the username is defined in capitals `YOURUSERNAME`, but will result as `yourusername`. So anything written in capitals, will be lowercase.

Go a head and install the Vernemq chart with the relevant configuration options.

    helm install vernemq vernemq/vernemq -f vernemq/values.yaml  --namespace vernemq

## Database

Within Kerberos Hub data is stored/required for users, recordings, sites, groups and many other entities. As for now the entire Kerberos.io technology stack is relying on MongoDB.

### MongoDB

A MongoDB instance is used for data persistence. Data might come from the Kerberos Pipeline or user interaction on the Kerberos Hub frontend.

We will create a namespace for our Mongodb deployment as well.

    kubectl create namespace mongodb

Create a persistent volume, this is where the data will be stored on disk.

    kubectl apply -f ./mongodb/fast.yaml

Before installing the mongodb helm chart, go and have a look in the `mongodb/values.yaml` file. You should update the root password to a custom secure value.

    helm install mongodb bitnami/mongodb --values ./mongodb/values.yaml -n mongodb

## TURN/STUN

Within Kerberos Hub we allow streaming live from the edge to the cloud without port-forwarding. To make this work we are using a technology called WebRTC that leverages a TURN/STUN server.

![hub-architecture](assets/images/hub-stunturn.png)

To run a TURN/STUN server please [have a look at following repository](https://github.com/kerberos-io/turn-and-stun), this will deploy a Docker container on a specific host that will act as a proxy for network traversal. The TURN/STUN server will make sure a connection from a Kerberos Agent to a Kerberos Hub viewer is established.

## Ingress

Ingresses are needed to expose the Kerberos Hub front-end and api to the internet or intranet. We prefer nginx ingress but if you would prefer Traefik, that is perfectly fine as well.

### Nginx

We'll use following helm chart `ingress-nginx` for setting up nginx in our cluster.

    helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
    --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
    --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace

On AKS add following attribute, otherwise nginx will not be accessible through `LoadBalancer`. You will receive an not reachable error.

    --set controller.service.externalTrafficPolicy=Local

### or (option) Install traefik

     helm install traefik traefik/traefik -f ./traefik/values-ssl.yaml

# Kerberos Hub

So once you hit this step, you should have installed a previous defined dependencies. Hopefully you didn't have too much pain with the certificates. Go to [the Kerberos Hub helm chart repo](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/hub) when installing for the first time, there you'll find all the relevant information for configuring and creating.

If you already know what to do, grab the latest `values.yaml` at the [Kerberos Hub Helm chart repo](https://github.com/kerberos-io/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/hub/values.yaml), and reference it from your `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command.

Install the Kerberos Hub chart in a specific namespace and take into the values.yaml file.

    helm install hub kerberos/hub --values values.yaml -n kerberos-hub --create-namespace

Upgrade the Kerberos Hub chart

    helm upgrade hub kerberos/hub --values values.yaml -n kerberos-hub

Uninstall the Kerberos Hub chart

    helm uninstall hub -n kerberos-hub

## Kerberos Hub Object Detector

[The Hub Object Detector](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub-objecttracker) shows how to levarage machine learning into Kerberos Hub. By deploying this workload in a GPU enabled Kubernetes cluster (or standalone container) you can predict and track objects in your video feeds captured by your Kerberos Agents and stored in Kerberos Vault.

![Hub Object Detector](./assets/images/hub-objectdetector.png)

[The object detector for Kerberos Hub](https://github.com/kerberos-io/hub-objecttracker) is showing how you connect to a message broker (RabbitMQ, Kafka or others) and how you can consume and download recordings from Kerberos Vault. In the [Kerberos Vault example directory](https://github.com/kerberos-io/vault/tree/master/examples) we are showing a concrete example of how to do this.

Kerberos Factory brings [the Kerberos Agent](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) to another level. [Kerberos Agent's](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) are deployed where and how you want, it can run as a binary, Docker container or inside a Kubernetes cluster. The latter is where Kerberos Factory comes into the picture. Kerberos Factory is a UI, build for non-technical users, that allows to deploy and configure [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) into your Kubernetes cluster more easily. It bypasses the complexity of creating Kubernetes resources, by providing a simple UI to connect a Kerberos Agent to your camera, and configure it for your usecase.

Kerberos Factory is build for the management of [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) in a Kubernetes cluster. If Kubernetes is out-of-scope for your deployment, and you plan to use a manual or single-node container deployment (e.g. Docker), it's recommended to use the default `docker compose` or `docker` CLI.

2. [Mission](#mission)
   
## Installation

As previously mentioned, running a Kerberos Factory, requires a Kubernetes cluster. If you plan to use solely `docker` or `docker compose` then Kerberos Factory is out-of-scope.

### Kubernetes

Leveraging Kerberos Factory allows you to deploy Kerberos Agents in you cluster. Kubernetes will automatically load balance your Kerberos Agents across your nodes, without you requiring all the hassle of scaling out your video landscape.

> Follow the `Kubernetes` tutorial [by navigating to the kubernetes sub folder in this repostitory](kubernetes/).

## Introductions

Please note that we have added a brief introduction to Kerberos Factory below. To get a complete overview [visit the documentation page](https://doc.kerberos.io), where you will be able to learn about all the ins and outs of the Kerberos.io ecosystem.

### Kerberos Factory

Kerberos Factory is a user interface which consumes and interacts with the Kubernetes API. It schedules [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) as Kubernetes resource, and more specificly Kubernetes deployments. For every camera stream a Kerberos Agent is created as a Kubernetes deployment.

![Kerberos Factory ui](assets/factory-login.gif)

Through a web interface a non-technical administrator can configure and add more [Kerberos Agents](https://github.com/kerberos-io/agent) to its cluster. The administrator has the ability to interact with the Kerberos Agent through one or more configuration screens, to tune and optimize the Kerberos Agent for his/her specific usecase.

#### ONVIF

Kerberos Factory allows you to scan the local network and create Kerberos Agents for every discovered camera. Once discovered, Kerberos Factory will create a Kubernetes deployment for every Kerberos Agent.

#### Global settings

Instead of tuning all your Kerberos Agent, Kerberos Factory allows you to set up global settings which are inherited by all your Kerberos Agents. This feature helps scaling out and controlling your video landscape more easily.

[![Kerberos Factory](./assets/kerberos-factory.png)](https://kerberos.io/)

### Mission

Kerberos Factory belong to the Enterprise suite. The goal of this suite is to support enterprises building a scalable video surveillance infrastructure that is open to support all business processes and usecases. Kerberos Enterprise Suite will do all the heavy lifting in terms scaling the processing and storage of you surveillance cameras. On top of that it will provide integration and extensibility to build your own applications on top of that using Swagger API's, and real-time messaging such as Kafka.

### Installing dependencies:
#### For Windows:
1. Check if the GPU of the system supports CUDA by checking if it is in this list: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
2. If the GPU supports CUDA, install it using this guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/installing-tensorflow-with-cuda-cudnn-and-gpu-support-on-windows-10-60693e46e781
3. Install the latest Python 3 version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
4. Run this command in command line:
    ```powershell
    PS C:> pip install numpy PyQt5 PyQt5-stubs pyqt5-tools
    ```
5. Install OpenCV with CUDA support using this tutorial: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/build-opencv-from-source-with-cuda-for-gpu-access-on-windows-5cd0ce2b9b37

#### For Ubuntu/Debian:
1. Check if the GPU of the system supports CUDA by checking if it is in this list: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus
2. If the GPU supports CUDA, install it using this guide: https://medium.com/@pydoni/how-to-install-cuda-11-4-cudnn-8-2-opencv-4-5-on-ubuntu-20-04-65c4aa415a7b
3. Run these commands:
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo chmod +x install_dependencies_ubuntu.sh    # make the script executable
foo@bar:~$ sudo ./install_dependencies_ubuntu.sh           # run the script to install the dependencies of the application
```


### Guide for using the Face Mask Detector application:

1. Execute the Python Script from command line like this:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python .\face_mask_detection.py
```
or
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 .\face_mask_detection.py
```

2. From the start menu, you can add or delete a camera from the camera list. When creating a camera, a name and an ID must be provided. The ID must be from one of these categories:
    - **integer (e.g.: 0, 1, 2...):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device physically connected to the system which uses the application. For instance, if you want to use the webcam of a laptop, you must create a camera with an ID of 0 (an explanation would be that, in particular for Ubuntu, the integrated camera of a laptop is interpreted as /dev/video0).
    - **IP address (e.g.: https://192.168.43.1:8080/video):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device connected to the same network as the system which uses the application. For example, one can connect an Android device as a remote camera using ""IP Webcam"" Google Playstore app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=ro&gl=US.
    - **Video file location:** A camera with this ID represents a locally stored video, on which our application will run the detection. This case is useful whenever we have an already pre-recorded video file, possibly from a camera that was not connected to a system with this application.
    
3. When you think that the camera list is ready, you can access the main menu.

4. In the main menu, you will have the following elements: 
    - **A main panel** where the selected camera will be displayed together with the detections of the masked or unmasked faces from it, as well as real time statistics of their numbers and its status (""Not Connected"" - the camera is not connected to the system, ""Safe"" - all people wear mask, ""Warning"" - 1 or 2 people do not wear a mask, ""Danger"" - more than 3 people do not wear a mask);
    - **A small selection menu** in the upper part of the window from where you can select which camera do you wish to visualize;
    - **A camera control panel** in the right part of the window where the camera list is displayed together with the status of every camera in real time;
    - **A ""Take Photo"" button** placed in the lower part of the window used for taking photos for further analysis in order to identify the persons not wearing a mask.
    
5. Despite the fact that you can take photos manually from the main menu, the application makes each of the connected cameras capable of taking photos automatically whenever its state switches to ""Warning"" or ""Danger"".

## Installation

1. Make sure you have the Java Runtime Environment Version 8 (or higher) installed on
your system. If not you can [download it at Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html).

2. Download the latest release of Surveillance Center (jar file) from
[the releases page](https://github.com/1element/sc/releases).

3. Save a copy of [application-example.properties](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1element/sc/master/src/main/resources/application-example.properties)
as `application.properties` in the same directory where the downloaded
jar file is located.

   For instance:

   ```
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1element/sc/master/src/main/resources/application-example.properties -O application.properties
   ```

4. Edit the `application.properties` file. This is the main configuration file
where your credentials, IP cameras, push notifications, etc. are configured.

   Most settings can be left at the default value. But there are a few required
ones, see the [configuration document](https://github.com/1element/sc/blob/master/docs/configuration.md)
for details.

5. Run the following command in a terminal to start the embedded Apache Tomcat
application server:

   ```
   java -jar surveillancecenter-<VERSION>.jar
   ```

   Once you see the output line `Started SurveillanceCenterApplication in X.X seconds`
you should be able to visit [http://localhost:8080/sc/](http://localhost:8080/sc/)
in your browser.

### Approaches

**1. Using Optical Flow:** Extracting spatial-temporal features using optical flow and training classifiers for detecting anomaly

**2. Using AlexNet:** Alexnet contains eight learned layers, five convolutional and three fully-connected layers. Pretrained Alexnet is applied to each frame of the video. Then we take the output of the fc7 layer which gives us a 4096 dimensional vector. 

**3. Time Series Analysis:** Standard statistical techniques for anomaly detection in the feature space we obtain from AlexNet.

**4. Topic Modelling:** A generative model of typical behavior is learned using good discriminative features, and then abnormal behaviors (outliers) are detected and classified as those that are badly explained by the learned model.

Surveillance is a lightweight video surveillance system using ffmpeg and [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/ ""Motion"")   intended for use on Raspberry Pi with network attached dual-stream cameras, but usable on any linux system with any video source for which ffmpeg & motion support.


Purpose:

1. I was not able to find an existing software package that met my needs of providing full high-def video stream recordings and motion detection to flag video segments that could run with limited CPU available on a raspberry pi.

2. I wanted to increase my Python knowledge, which has previously been limited to very small projects, the largest of which was a database translation and mostly were very small, no more than a single function. This project seemed large enough to be interesting and require learning some of the language capabilities I hadn't previously been exposed to.

With #2 in mind, along with my previous software knowledge existing primarily of c++, java, ada and c, I welcome feedback from more experienced python developers on more pythonic -- I'd like to learn more.

In total, we have 3 levels of hierarchy and 5 main stages of computation. We assume that individual tracklets are already known. The five stages are:

1. Orientation
2. Individual action
3. Group detection
4. Group activity
5. Scene activity

That is why I created a Python application using OpenCV (with CUDA support) based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, more precisely the tiny option, capable of monitoring the safety level of a space with video surveillance. This is the Jetson Nano version of the application.","# Face Mask Detector for Jetson Nano
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, more and more people are concerned with protecting themselves using masks, thus the need of software capable of monitoring whether the people are wearing masks or not. That is why I created a PyQt5 application using OpenCV (with CUDA support) based on the YOLOv4 algorithm, more precisely the tiny option, capable of monitoring the safety level of a space with video surveillance through multiple video cameras, connected either via USB or IP to the system. This is the Jetson Nano version of the application.

### Guide for using the Face Mask Detector application:

1. Run these commands:
```console
foo@bar:~$ sudo chmod +x install_dependencies_jetson_nano.sh    # make the script executable
foo@bar:~$ sudo ./install_dependencies_jetson_nano.sh           # run the script to install the dependencies of the application
```

2. Execute the Python Script from command line like this:
```console
foo@bar:~$ python ./face_mask_detection.py
```
or
```console
foo@bar:~$ python3 ./face_mask_detection.py
```

3. From the start menu, you can add or delete a camera from the camera list. When creating a camera, a name and an ID must be provided. The ID must be from one of these categories:
    - **integer (e.g.: 0, 1, 2...):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device physically connected to the system which uses the application. For instance, if you want to use the webcam of a laptop, you must create a camera with an ID of 0 (an explanation would be that, in particular for Ubuntu, the integrated camera of a laptop is interpreted as /dev/video0).
    - **IP address (e.g.: https://192.168.43.1:8080/video):** A camera with this ID represents a video recording device connected to the same network as the system which uses the application. For example, one can connect an Android device as a remote camera using ""IP Webcam"" Google Playstore app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=ro&gl=US.
    - **Video file location:** A camera with this ID represents a locally stored video, on which our application will run the detection. This case is useful whenever we have an already pre-recorded video file, possibly from a camera that was not connected to a system with this application.
    
4. When you think that the camera list is ready, you can access the main menu.

5. In the main menu, you will have the following elements: 
    - **A main panel** where the selected camera will be displayed together with the detections of the masked or unmasked faces from it, as well as real time statistics of their numbers and its status (""Not Connected"" - the camera is not connected to the system, ""Safe"" - all people wear mask, ""Warning"" - 1 or 2 people do not wear a mask, ""Danger"" - more than 3 people do not wear a mask);
    - **A small selection menu** in the upper part of the window from where you can select which camera do you wish to visualize;
    - **A camera control panel** in the right part of the window where the camera list is displayed together with the status of every camera in real time;
    - **A ""Take Photo"" button** placed in the lower part of the window used for taking photos for further analysis in order to identify the persons not wearing a mask.
    
6. Despite the fact that you can take photos manually from the main menu, the application makes each of the connected cameras capable of taking photos automatically whenever its state switches to ""Warning"" or ""Danger"".

> **DEPRECATED PROJECT**: note that this project has been replaced by a backward-compatible project located at [**DMS<sup>3</sup>**](https://github.com/richbl/go-distributed-motion-s3 ""Distributed Motion Surveillance Security System""), which is a refactor of this project rewritten in Go, and features greater features, stability, and functionality.


**Motion-Surveillance** is a Ruby-based video surveillance system using the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") motion detection software package. Motion-Surveillance includes the following package components:

   - Motion-Monitor: integrated system services that monitor the status of devices on a given network, and start/stop the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") package as appropriate.
   - Motion-Mail: a configurable component for generating and sending an email with images whenever [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") generates a motion-related event.

## How Motion-Surveillance Works

Each of the Motion-Surveillance package components perform independent services that are integrated with the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package.

### Motion-Monitor Operation
Motion-Monitor is responsible for starting/stopping the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package. 

It does this by periodically scanning a network for the existence of a monitored device(s). This device can be anything that exposes its MAC address on the network (*e.g.*, a mobile phone on a home LAN). In the default case, if that device is found on the network, it's assumed that ""someone is home"" and so, [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is not started (or stopped if already running). If that device MAC is no longer found on the network, it's assumed that ""nobody is home"" and [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is started (if not already running). Similar logic is used in the reverse case: when a monitored device is once again ""back home,"" [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is stopped.

Alternatively, the 'Always On' feature, if enabled, uses time-of-day to start/stop the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package. Motion-Monitor will look at the time range specified, and if the current time falls between the time range, [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") will be activated. Once the current time falls outside of the specified time range, [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is then stopped. The optional 'Always On' feature works in conjunction with IoT device detection.

Operationally, Motion-Monitor is comprised of three component objects (or actors): 

- **System**: a system cron job that periodically wakes up the **MotionMonitorManager** component
- **MotionMonitorManager**: checks to see if **MotionMonitorDaemon** is running, and if it isn't, determines whether it should. The **MotionMonitorManager** component is responsible for starting the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") software package
- **MotionMonitorDaemon**: while [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") is active, periodically checks to see if it should continue to run, and stops it if necessary 

The activity diagram below shows the work flow for each of these components:

![Motion-Surveillance Activity Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/richbl/motion-surveillance/master/activity_diagram.png ""Motion-Surveillance Activity Diagram"")

> **Note:** additional information about the Motion-Monitor component can be found in the Motion-Surveillance installation file ([`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/richbl/motion-surveillance/blob/master/INSTALL.md ""INSTALL.md"")).

### Motion-Mail Operation

Motion-Mail is the Motion-Surveillance component responsible for sending an email whenever a valid movement event is triggered in [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"").

These events are triggered through the [`on_picture_save`](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/ConfigOptionOnPictureSave ""on_picture_save command"") command and the [`on_movie_end`](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/ConfigOptionOnMovieEnd ""on_movie_end command"") command in [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") and are how Motion-Mail gets called. 

The syntax for these [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") commands are:
  
	<on_picture_save|on_movie_end> <absolute path to ruby> <absolute path to motion_mail.rb> <%D %f %t>

These commands are managed through the [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") configuration file called `motion.conf`.

Once configured, Motion-Mail will respond to these [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") event [hooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking ""Hooking""), and an email will be generated and sent along with an optional image file or video clip.

> **Note:** additional information about the Motion-Mail component can be found in the Motion-Surveillance installation file ([`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/richbl/motion-surveillance/blob/master/INSTALL.md ""INSTALL.md"")).

## Motion-Surveillance Requirements

 - A Linux-based operating system
	 - While Motion-Surveillance was written and tested under Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), there should be no reason why this won't work just fine under other Linux distributions. Specific Unix-like tools used by Motion-Surveillance include:
		 - [ps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps_%28Unix%29): process status
		 - [arp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol): address resolution protocol
		 - [grep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep): globally search a regular expression and print
		 - [ping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)): ICMP network packet echo/response tool
		 - [aplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aplay): ALSA audio player (optional)
 - [Motion](http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome ""Motion"") correctly installed and configured with appropriate video devices
 - [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ ""Ruby"") (2.0+) correctly installed and configured
	 - [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/ ""Rubygems"") installed and configured with the following gems:
		 - [mail](https://rubygems.org/gems/mail) (2.5.4+)

137,video-person-detection,1element,N/A,https://github.com/1element/video-person-detection,https://api.github.com/repos/1element/video-person-detection,REST API server to detect people in video files using TensorFlow Lite.,"# Video Person Detection

REST API server that can detect the presence of humans in a video file. 
Intended for video surveillance to post-process IP camera footage and reduce 
false positives.

Video frames are analyzed using TensorFlow Lite. This deep learning-based 
approach will reduce false motion alerts usually caused by weather conditions 
(e.g. clouds changing the lightning) or insects crawling across the camera lens.

The Google Coral USB Accelerator (TPU) is optionally supported to speed up 
inference time. See performance measurements below.

Sample request:

```
curl -d '{""videoFilePath"":""video-file.mp4"", ""cameraId"":""backyard""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -X POST http://localhost:8000/detect/person
```

Response:

```
{
  ""personDetected"": true,
  ""personConfidence"": 0.89
}
```


## How to run

The preferred way is to run video-person-detection in a docker container. 
If you don't want to use docker, you can install python and all dependencies
to run the uvicorn server on your own.


### With docker

Clone the repository and run:

```
sudo docker-compose build
```

This will build the docker image.

Afterwards start the container:

```
sudo docker-compose up
```

You should end up with a webserver running on port 8000.

Refer to the configuration section on how to configure the application.


### Without docker

If you don't want to use a docker container you can install all dependencies
on your own.

These instructions have been tested on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS.

```
# install python 3.8 and virtual environment support
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv

# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/1element/video-person-detection.git .

# create a new python virtual environment in the cloned repository directory
python3 -m venv .venv 

# activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the appropriate TensorFlow Lite version for your platform according to
[https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python)

For example:

```
pip3 install https://dl.google.com/coral/python/tflite_runtime-2.1.0.post1-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
```

Install the project dependencies (Pillow, fastapi, uvicorn, 
opencv-python-headless):

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have the Coral USB accelerator you should [install the Edge TPU runtime](https://coral.ai/docs/accelerator/get-started/#1-install-the-edge-tpu-runtime)
as well:

```
echo ""deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt coral-edgetpu-stable main"" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/coral-edgetpu.list
curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libedgetpu1-std
```

Download the TensorFlow Lite models:

```
curl -o models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess.tflite https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-coral/edgetpu/master/test_data/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess.tflite
curl -o models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-coral/edgetpu/master/test_data/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite
```

You should now be able to start the webserver by executing:

```
uvicorn videopersondetection.main:app --host 0.0.0.0
```


## Configuration

A yaml configuration file `config/config.yml` must exist. Beside different 
thresholds you can configure how many frames should be skipped. So only 
every n-th frame will be processed. This can increase the performance 
significantly, but might also affect accurancy.

A camera specific configuration is possible to set a minimum required area of
the bounding box for the detected person. You can also define a zone contour
to ignore if the center of the bounding box for the detected person is inside
it.

Make sure the property `video_file_base_path` is set to the directory
containing the video files you want to analyze.

Refer to the provided [example configuration](https://github.com/1element/video-person-detection/blob/master/config/config.yml)
for details.


## Usage

Sample request via cURL:

```
curl -d '{""videoFilePath"":""video-file.mp4"", ""cameraId"":""backyard""}' -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" -X POST http://localhost:8000/detect/person
```

The `videoFilePath` property must contain the relative path to the video file 
to analyze (based upon the configured `video_file_base_path` in 
`config/config.yml`). The application must have read access to this location.

The `cameraId` property must match one of the configured cameras in 
`config/config.yml`.


## Performance

A simple benchmark script is included in this repository.

To download the benchmark video file run:

```
curl -o benchmark.mkv http://www.jell.yfish.us/media/jellyfish-3-mbps-hd-h264.mkv
```

Run the benchmark (`benchmark.py`):

```
python3 -m videopersondetection.benchmark
```

Here are some reports for the downloaded jellyfish videofile

139,ftp2mqtt,1element,N/A,https://github.com/1element/ftp2mqtt,https://api.github.com/repos/1element/ftp2mqtt,Bridge images from an IP camera via FTP to an MQTT broker.,"# ftp2mqtt

This microservice acts as a bridge between IP cameras (with FTP support
for motion detected events) and an MQTT broker.

It should run on a private network only, it is not recommend to expose it
to the internet.


## How to build

You need the Java Development Kit (JDK) 10 installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/1element/ftp2mqtt.git .
   ```

2. Run Gradle build:

   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```

You will end up with an artifact (`ftp2mqtt-<VERSION>.jar`) in
the `build/libs/` directory.

You can start the application by executing:

```
java -jar ftp2mqtt-<VERSION>.jar
```

If you want to use Docker there is a Gradle task to build a Docker image:

```
./gradlew build docker
```

This can also be done manually by passing the artifact as an argument
to the Docker build command:

```
docker build -t ftp2mqtt --build-arg JAR_FILE=build/libs/ftp2mqtt-<VERSION>.jar .
```


## Configuration

If you start the application Spring Boot expects a configuration file
`application.properties` in the same directory where your JAR file is
located. If you use Docker there is a volume `/config` for this.

Example configuration [application.properties](https://github.com/1element/ftp2mqtt/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties):

```
# FTP server
ftp.port=2121
ftp.password=secret

# MQTT
mqtt.broker-connection=ssl://localhost:1883
mqtt.username=username
mqtt.password=password
mqtt.topic-prefix=ipcamera/
```

You can specify the port and the password for the built-in FTP server.
Connections are accepted for any username. The FTP username will be
prefixed with the configured `mqtt.topic-prefix` and used as the
MQTT topic to publish to.

So if your IP camera uploads motion detected images to the FTP server
using the username ""backyard"", the image will be published to the MQTT
brokers topic `ipcamera/backyard` (assuming ""ipcamera/"" is configured as
the prefix).

You also need to configure your MQTT broker connection (host and port)
as well as the username and password.


## Contributions

This application was written for my own purpose, therefore it may lack in
features and configuration abilities. In case it might be useful for
someone I decided to share it. However, pull requests are welcome.

> Kalana Abeywardena, Sakuna Jayasundara, Sachira Karunasena, Shechem Sumanthiran, Dr. Peshala Jayasekara, Dr. Ranga Rodrigo

<p align='justify'>
Real-time and online action localization in a video is a critical yet highly challenging problem. Accurate action localization requires utilization of both temporal and spatial information. Recent attempts achieve this by using computationally intensive 3D CNN architectures or highly redundant two-stream architectures with optical flow, making them both unsuitable for real-time, online applications. To accomplish activity localization under highly challenging real-time constraints, we propose utilizing fast and efficient key-point based bounding box prediction to spatially localize actions. We then introduce a tube-linking algorithm that maintains the continuity of action tubes temporally in the presence of occlusions. Further, we eliminate the need for a two-stream architecture by combining temporal and spatial information into a cascaded input to a single network, allowing the network to learn from both types of information. Temporal information is efficiently extracted using a structural similarity index map as opposed to computationally intensive optical flow. Despite the simplicity of our approach, our lightweight end-to-end architecture achieves state-of-the-art frame-mAP on the challenging UCF101-24 dataset, demonstrating a performance gain of 6.4% over the previous best online methods. We also achieve state-of-the-art video-mAP results compared to both online and offline methods. Moreover, our model achieves a frame rate of 41.8 FPS, which is a 10.7% improvement over contemporary real-time methods.

## Highlights
- Utilize key-point-based detection architecture for the first time for the task of ST action localization, which reduces model complexity and inference time over traditional anchor-box-based approaches.
- Demonstrate that the explicit computation of OF is unnecessary and that the SSIM index map obtains sufficient inter-frame temporal information.
- A single network provided with both spatial and temporal information, and allowing it to extract necessary information through discriminative learning.
- An efficient tube-linking algorithm that extrapolates the tubes for a short period using past detections for real-time deployment.

## Installation

The code was tested on Ubuntu 18.04, with Anaconda Python 3.7 and PyTorch v1.4.0. NVIDIA GPUs are needed for both training and testing. After install Anaconda:

0. [Optional but recommended] create a new conda environment and activate the environment.
```
conda create --name CenterNet python=3.7
conda activate CenterNet
```
1. Install pytorch 1.4.0:
```
conda install pytorch=1.4.0 torchvision -c pytorch
```
Based on original [repository](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet), there can be slight reduction in performances for spatial localization with `cudann batch normalization` enabled. You can manually open `torch/nn/functional.py` and find the line with `torch.batch_norm` and replace the `torch.backends.cudnn.enabled` with `False`. 

2. Install [COCOAPI](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi):
```
# COCOAPI=/path/to/clone/cocoapi
git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git $COCOAPI
cd $COCOAPI/PythonAPI
make
python setup.py install --user
```

3. Install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Datasets
<p align='justify'>
We evaluate our framework on two datasets, <a href=https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php>UCF101-24</a> and <a href=http://jhmdb.is.tue.mpg.de/>J-HMDB21</a>. UCF101-24 is a subset of UCF101<sup>[1]</sup> dataset with ST labels, having 3207 untrimmed videos with 24 action classes, that may contain multiple instances for the same action class. J-HMDB-21 is a subset of the HMDB51<sup>[2]</sup> dataset having 928 temporally trimmed videos with 21 actions, each containing a single action instance. 

Download the datasets and extract the frames. Place the extracted frames in <emp>rgb-images</emp> in the respective dataset directory in [Datasets](https://github.com/Kalana304/KORSAL/tree/main/Datasets). The data directory should look as follows:

## Training CenterNet

### Setting up the CenterNet

When seting up CenterNet, we followed the instructions mentioned in their [official repository](https://github.com/xingyizhou/CenterNet). The modified scripts of CenterNet for Action Detection are provided in this [repository](https://github.com/Kalana304/KORSAL/tree/main/CenterNet). 

To install DCNv2, follow the below instructions:

1. **Build NMS**

```
cd CenterNet\src\lib\external
#python setup.py install
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Comment out the parameter in setup.py when building `nms` extension to solve invalid numeric argument `/Wno-cpp`: `#extra_compile_args=[""-Wno-cpp"", ""-Wno-unused-function""]` (the provided script by us has made the changes already).

2. **Clone and build original DCNv2**

```
cd CenterNet\src\lib\models\networks
rm -rf DCNv2
git clone https://github.com/CharlesShang/DCNv2
```

After cloning the original DCNv2, navigate to the directory and make the following changes:

```
cd DCNv2
vim cuda/dcn_va_cuda.cu
""""""
# extern THCState *state;
THCState *state = at::globalContext().lazyInitCUDA();
""""""
```

Finally, execute the following command to build DCNv2:

```
python setup.py build develop
```

### Training from the scratch
To train from the scratch with either UCF101-24 or J-HMDB21 datasets, the following command can be run. 

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> 
```

### Resuming from saved checkpoint
To resume the training from the last checkpoint saved, run the following command.

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> --resume 
```

Further, to resume the training from a specific chekpoint saved, run the following command.

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> --resume --load_model <path to the saved model>
```

### Transfer Learning using the best checkpoint
To tranfer learn from a pre-trained checkpoint, run the following command.

```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main_SMDouble.py --dataset <dataset> --gpus <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --num_epochs <epochs (default: 60)> --variant <variation (default: 1)> --load_model /path/to/checkpoint
```

The pre-trained model checkpoints trained on J-HMDB21 and UCF101-24 datasets can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jb5QfujoQngP4QqyN-PGvYba1jwhb9th?usp=sharing). Place the chekpoints at `./CenterNet/exp/$DATASET_NAME/dla34/rgb/$CHKPT_NAME` to be compatible with the directory path definitions in the Centernet scripts. 

## Saving Detections
For evaluation, the spatial detections needs to be saved as <I>.mat </I> files. First, navigate to ./Save Detections/ and execute the following command:
```
python CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python SaveDetections.py --dataset <dataset> --ngpu <gpu id> --exp_id <save dir name> --task doubleSM --frame_gap <default:1> --variant <default:1> --load_model /path/to/checkpoint --result_root /path/to/detections
```

## Online Tube Generation

After the spatial detections are saved for each video, the action tubes and paths are generated using the proposed online tube generation algorithm and its variation that are based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/Kalana304/realtime-action-detection) which is also provided for comparison. The codes can be found in `./online-tubes/`.
 - To run the code, you will need to install MATLAB. You can install a [free trial](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) for testing purposes. Make sure you add the MATLAB installation path to the conda environment if you are executing scripts using command line.
 - If you only have command line priviledges, you can install [Octave](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Debian_systems) and execute the tube generation.

### Executing with MATLAB

1. Navigate to the respective directory: 
```
cd ./online-tubes/EXP_without_BBOX
```
2. Change the paths based on where the data (saved detections) is located and results need saving in `I01onlineTubes.m` and `utils/initDatasetOpts.m`.
3. Execute `I01onlineTubes.m`. When executing using command line:
```
matlab -batch ""I01onlineTubes.m""
```

### Executing with Octave

1. Navigate to the respective directory: 
```
cd ./online-tubes/EXP_without_BBOX
```
2. Change the paths based on where the data (saved detections) is located and results need saving in `I01onlineTubes.m` and `utils/initDatasetOpts.m`.
3. Execute `I01onlineTubes.m`. When executing using command line:
```
octave I01onlineTubes.m
```
*There can be errors when running the current scripts in Octave. This is due to `-v7.3` argument used in `save()` function in MATLAB scripts. You can simply remove the `-v7.3` argument in `save()` functions and run without errors.* 

## Performance
<p align='justify'>
We describe our experimental results and compare them with state-of-the-art offline and online methods that use either RGB or both RGB and OF inputs. Further, for comparison
we present results on action localization using only the appearance (A) information extracted by a single frame. The results of our proposed method presented in Table demonstrate that we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

We analyze the inference times for different variations of our pipeline based on the different modules in the framework and the overall inference time in the below Table.
Evidently, any preprocessing will have an impact on the inference time. Thus, the SS-map achieves a balance between the run-time and the accuracy over the other variations in the framework.

==================================


Для установки версии IvideonServer без графического интерфейса (для Linux-серверов) требуется установить отдельно пакет ivideon-server-headless или camera-server-headless:

 sudo apt-get install ivideon-server-headless

Далее необходимо провести настройку сервера с графическим интерфейсом на отдельной машине, затем скопировать файл конфигурации сервера videoserverd.config в директорию /home/<имя пользователя>/.IvideonServer/videoserverd.config

Если необходимо вести запись локального архива, то необходимо изменить путь к архиву в перенесенном файле конфигурации:

""path"" : ""/home/<имя пользователя>/.IvideonServer/archive""

Привязка сервера к аккаунту производится следующей командой:

/opt/ivideon/ivideon-server/videoserver --config-filename=/path/to/videoserverd.config --attach --email=""account@ivideon.com"" --server-name=""My First Server""

Для автоматического запуска сервера при старте системы необходимо выполнить следующее:

sudo /opt/ivideon/ivideon-server/init_ctl install <имя пользователя> <путь к файлу конфигурации>

Для удаления его из автозапуска:
sudo /opt/ivideon/ivideon-server/init_ctl uninstall

Для управления видеосервером необходимо использовать скрипт init.d:
/etc/init.d/videoserver <start|stop|restart|status>

Clouduvc is used to create the simplest video surveillance system based on:
- Linux powered device, such as Raspberry Pi;
- webcam;
- cloud storage, e.g. Google Drive (optional).

How it works:
* Clouduvc records videos of a fixed length or takes photos and saves them to a local storage (such as an external hard drive). Recording is performed daily at a certain period of time or around the clock.
* Optionally, the latest files are uploaded to the cloud storage.
* Old files are removed from the local and the cloud storages according to the configured retention periods.

## Dependencies

* [guvcview](http://guvcview.sourceforge.net/) - video capturing software for UVC devices. Thanks to the built-in automatic camera adjustment function, this is a good solution for webcams without auto brightness and auto contrast support.
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - guvcview alternative for cameras with built-in auto brightness and auto contrast. Doesn't support camera adjustment, but allows you to control the video compression ratio, achieving better performance on low-end devices.
* [rclone](https://rclone.org/) - cloud storage synchronization software. A list of supported services can be found at [https://rclone.org/](https://rclone.org/).

## Installation

1. Install dependencies. For Debian based distributions:
``` sh
$ sudo apt install rclone ffmpeg
```
or (not preferred)
``` sh
$ sudo apt install rclone guvcview
```
2. Configure rclone (see complete guide at [https://rclone.org/docs/](https://rclone.org/docs/)):
``` sh
$ rclone config
```
Note that rclone also provides a login method for devices without a desktop environment.

3. Download clouduvc:
``` sh
$ wget https://github.com/odolgy/clouduvc/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip && rm master.zip && mv clouduvc-master clouduvc
```
4. Configure the required parameters in ""clouduvc_config.sh"" file:
``` sh
$ cd clouduvc
$ cp clouduvc_config.example.sh clouduvc_config.sh
$ editor clouduvc_config.sh
```
5. Run and check that everything works:  
``` sh
$ ./clouduvc_record.sh
```
6. You can check output video resolution, fps and other parameters using [ffprobe](https://ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html):
``` sh
$ ffprobe -hide_banner video_file.avi 
```
7. Configure autorun. Example for distributions with systemd:
``` sh
$ sudo cp clouduvc.service /etc/systemd/system/
$ sudo editor /etc/systemd/system/clouduvc.service
$ sudo systemctl enable clouduvc.service
```

8. Check that everything works:
``` sh
$ sudo systemctl start clouduvc.service
$ systemctl status clouduvc.service
```

Python script using machine learning to classify images from IP cameras.


## Introduction

This Python script is meant to be executed as a systemd service. It will 
subscribe an MQTT broker to receive JPEG images from an IP camera.

The machine learning framework TensorFlow is used to classify images.
A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Inception v3 model 
needs to be retrained with a set of images from your IP camera to classify 
the image either as *person* or as *nothing*.

If a person is detected in the image, the Python script will publish the 
image to a specified MQTT topic. A threshold can be configured for this 
to publish even images with a lower probability score.

This script was designed to work on a Raspberry Pi 3 (ARM architecture), 
but it also runs on x86_64 and should actually run on all platforms where 
TensorFlow and Python are available.

On a Raspberry Pi 3 this is pretty slow (roughly three seconds per image). 
So make sure you have a good pre-processing of your IP camera feed and 
deliver only images where potentially movement was detected. You could 
either use the built-in motion detection of your IP camera or preferable 
a third party software detection like [Motion](https://motion-project.github.io/) for this.


## Dependencies

* TensorFlow
* Python 2.7
* Python PyYAML (pyyaml) and Eclipse Paho MQTT (paho-mqtt) packages

All dependencies can be installed automatically by executing `./install.sh`.


## Usage

### Installation

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/1element/ip-camera-image-inference.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
./install.sh
```


### Train your model

The TensorFlow Inception v3 model is used to classify images either as
*person* or as *nothing*. For accurate scoring you need to retrain the 
final layer of the Inception model.

So before you can start `retrain.py` you need a set of images from your 
IP camera that represent the two classes *person* and *nothing*. 
Copy these images to the `retrain/person/` and `retrain/nothing/` 
directories.

After this execute:

```
python retrain.py --image_dir=/path/to/ip-camera-image-inference/retrain
```

This will take some time, especially if you run it on a Raspberry Pi. 
Consider running the training on a faster machine if you can.

Copy the output graph and labels from the temporary directory of 
your system to the model directory:

```
cp /tmp/output_graph.pb /path/to/ip-camera-image-inference/model/
cp /tmp/output_labels.txt /path/to/ip-camera-image-inference/model/
```

If you are interested in details of the retraining process refer 
to the official [TensorFlow image retraining tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining).


### Configuration

Edit the provided configuration file `config.yml`. The TensorFlow model 
directory and your MQTT broker connection as well as a few other settings 
can be configured there.


### Run as service

The Python script `image-inference.py` should be executed as a systemd 
service. There is a template file `image-inference.service` for this.
Change the paths in this file according to your environment.

Afterwards use the following commands to set up the service:

```
# copy service configuration
sudo cp image-inference.service /etc/systemd/system/

# reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# enable auto start
sudo systemctl enable image-inference.service

# start service now
sudo systemctl start image-inference.service

# show status
sudo systemctl status image-inference.service
```


## Previous versions

There is a previous version using a directory observer to receive images 
and FTP to distribute the classified image. If you are interested in this 
checkout the tag `v1.0.0`.


## Contributions

This script was written for my own purpose, therefore it lacks in 
features and configuration abilities. In case it might be useful for 
someone, I decided to share it. However, pull requests are welcome.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-BSD--3--Clause-green)](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD--3--Clause-green)

PyGOFPID is a Python package implementing
[perimeter intrusion detection (PID)](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/9/3601)
systems for video protection.

Leveraging [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python), you can easily
define a pipeline using good old fashioned (GOF) computer vision methods, like
[foreground detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreground_detection) and
[mathematical morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_morphology).

PyGOFPID is distributed under the open source 3-clause BSD license.

## Description

Class `GOFPID` is a versatile tool allowing to build a parameterizable PID
pipeline, composed of:

1. input frame denoising by spatial blurring;
2. foreground detection by background subtraction or frame differencing;
3. foreground mask denoising by mathematical morphology;
4. foreground blob creation;
5. blob tracking (WIP);
6. post-filtering;
7. intrusion detection.

See `examples/video.py` for a simple example.

## Comparison on i-LIDS

GOFPID is useful for comparison between ancient and new generations of PID,
between good old fashioned and deep learning based PID.

[i-LIDS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4105319) is a standard dataset
for testing video based PID.

See [pyPID](https://gitlab.liris.cnrs.fr/dlohani/pypid) for a benchmark between
PID systems on i-LIDS dataset, with results given for

150,nvidia-gpu-kubernetes,kerberos-io,kerberos-io,https://github.com/kerberos-io/nvidia-gpu-kubernetes,https://api.github.com/repos/kerberos-io/nvidia-gpu-kubernetes,An example of how to install the NVIDIA GPU operator on your Kubernetes cluster and scale your machine learning with Kerberos Vault.,"# NVIDIA operator on Kubernetes with Kerberos Vault

Machine learning using the NVIDIA GPU operator with Kerberos Vault on Kubernetes. Integrate and scale your Machine learning using Kerberos Vault and  a GPU node-based Kubernetes Cluster.

In this example we will show you how you can use [Kerberos Agents](https://doc.kerberos.io/enterprise/first-things-first/) and [Kerberos Vault](https://doc.kerberos.io/vault/first-things-first/) to scale your machine learning and video surveillance or analytics landscape. By decoupling your cameras and GPU's using the Kubernetes platform and Kerberos Enterprise you bring real scale into the picture.

![NVIDIA operator Kerberos Vault](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/132137679-33fc02df-085f-47cf-8587-301bd3448e63.png)

The following example will show you how to setup a node with one or more GPU's in a Kubernetes Cluster. Afterwards we will deploy a machine learning workload that can recognise pedestrians in one or more recordings. To handle that execution we have a couple of cameras in place (called Kerberos agents) and our open/extensible storage platform called [Kerberos Vault](https://doc.kerberos.io/vault/first-things-first/).

![NVIDIA integration with kafka](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/132138400-61f6b2a3-04e2-461f-aee7-18d8bc28a3e8.png)

[Kerberos Vault](https://doc.kerberos.io/vault/first-things-first/) receives recordings from one or more (or thousands) of Kerberos agents, and will trigger events through integrations such as Kafka, SQS, etc. Everytime a recording is stored in [Kerberos Vault](https://doc.kerberos.io/vault/first-things-first/), a real-time message is generated, and a consumer (the workload we have deployed in our cluster) will download the recording and start the interference on one of you GPU based Kubernetes nodes (using the NVIDIA operator). 

# Prepare a node to run GPU based deployments

![NV-GPU-Operator-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/132136901-44d90617-a80a-4933-9eca-bf965622d237.png)

To provision GPU worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, the following NVIDIA software components are required – the driver, container runtime, device plugin and monitoring. As shown in Figure 1, these components need to be manually provisioned before GPU resources are available to the cluster and also need to be managed during the operation of the cluster. The GPU Operator simplifies both the initial deployment and management of the components by containerizing all the components and using standard Kubernetes APIs for automating and managing these components including versioning and upgrades. The GPU operator is fully open-source and is available [at the NVIDIA GitHub repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator).

![GPU-Operator-Manual-Install-Figure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/132136925-7f7a2c88-7d58-41ba-8b8f-8f72b0af82de.png)

## NVidia Drivers
We are assuming an Ubuntu 20.4 system with a clean installation. First things first, let's go ahead with installing the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA drivers.

    sudo -s
    apt install nvidia-driver-455
    reboot
    
    sudo -s
    nvidia-smi
    apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit

## Setup tools

Once we have the NVIDIA drivers installed, we are ready to setup Docker and Kubernetes. Next to that we will enable NVIDIA for Docker and later on we will install the NVIDIA Kubernetes operator.

### Install Docker

Let's install Docker. We could also use `containerd` with Kubernetes.

    apt install docker.io -y    
    
Once installed modify the cgroup driver, so kubernetes will be using it correctly. By default Kubernetes cgroup driver was set to systems but docker was set to systemd.

    sudo mkdir /etc/docker
    cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
    {
      ""exec-opts"": [""native.cgroupdriver=systemd""],
      ""log-driver"": ""json-file"",
      ""log-opts"": {
        ""max-size"": ""100m""
      },
      ""storage-driver"": ""overlay2""
    }
    EOF

    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart docker


### Install Kubernetes
  
Install the Kubernetes toolset.

    apt update -y
    apt install apt-transport-https curl -y
    curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add
    apt-add-repository ""deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main""
    apt update -y && apt install kubeadm kubelet kubectl kubernetes-cni -y

Disable swap as this is required by Kubernetes.

    swapoff -a
    sudo sed -i.bak '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab

Initiate the cluster.

    kubeadm init

This might take a couple of minutes but once finished you should see following message.

    Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

    To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

      mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
      sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
      sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

    You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
    Run ""kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml"" with one of the options listed at:
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

    Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

    kubeadm join 192.168.1.103:6443 --token ej7ckt.uof7o2iplqf0r2up \
        --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:9cbcc00d34be2dbd605174802d9e52fbcdd617324c237bf58767b369fa586209
  
      
### Install NVIDIA for Docker

To enable NVIDIA for Docker, [a couple of things will need to be installed](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin).

    distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID) \
       && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - \
       && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
       
       apt-get update
       apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
       systemctl restart docker
       docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.1.1-base-ubi8 nvidia-smi
   
Make an additional modification to the `daemon.json` of Docker.

        nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
        
Make sure the `.json` file is aligned with below config.

    {
        ""default-runtime"": ""nvidia"",
        ""runtimes"": {
            ""nvidia"": {
                ""path"": ""/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime"",
                ""runtimeArgs"": []
            }
        },
        ""exec-opts"": [""native.cgroupdriver=systemd""],
        ""log-driver"": ""json-file"",
        ""log-opts"": {
            ""max-size"": ""100m""
        },
        ""storage-driver"": ""overlay2""
    }

Restart the Docker daemon to complete the installation after setting the default runtime:

    sudo systemctl restart docker

### or Install NVIDIA for containerd

Update containerd to use nvidia as the default runtime and add nvidia runtime configuration. This can be done by adding below config to `/etc/containerd/config.toml` and restarting containerd service.

    version = 2
    [plugins]
      [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri""]
        [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd]
          default_runtime_name = ""nvidia""
    
          [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd.runtimes]
            [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd.runtimes.nvidia]
              privileged_without_host_devices = false
              runtime_engine = """"
              runtime_root = """"
              runtime_type = ""io.containerd.runc.v2""
              [plugins.""io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"".containerd.runtimes.nvidia.options]
                BinaryName = ""/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime""

Restart the Containerd daemon to complete the installation after setting the default runtime:

    sudo systemctl restart containerd

## Enable NVidia GPU operator

> Find the full tutorial on [the official NVIDIA docs page](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/getting-started.html).

Download the NVIDIA helm chart

    helm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia && helm repo update

Install the NVIDIA helm chart in the `gpu-operator` namespace.

    helm install --wait --generate-name \
    -n gpu-operator --create-namespace \
    nvidia/gpu-operator

## Create a GPU workload and scale with Kerberos Vault

When creating a new pod or deployment, you assign a number of GPUs to the workload, this will make sure the workload is scheduled on a node which has one or more GPUs available. Magic, all done by the NVIDIA Kubernetes operator. So the conclusion is that you can add as much nodes and GPUs you want, and you can simply increase the `replicas: 1` parameter to the number of GPUs you have available.

![Integration in practice (Yolov3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1546779/133740877-a0bc2261-57ad-47b7-ab01-a929329b729a.png)

Once you have created below deployment in your Kubernetes cluster, you will have one or more machine learning workloads integrated with your Kerberos Vault and Kafka broker. Due to the nature of Kafka, and how we designed the Kerberos Enterprise suite, it will also loadbalance or divide and concur the request over your different GPU's. Have some fun ;)

## Introduction

<div align= justify>
Fast and accurate identification of the co-interest persons, who draw joint interest of the surrounding people, plays an important role in social scene understanding and surveillance. Previous study mainly focuses on detecting co-interest persons from a single-view video. In this paper, we study a much more realistic and challeng-
ing problem, namely co-interest person (CIP) detection from multiple temporally-synchronized videos taken by the complementary and time-varying views. Specifically, we use a top-view camera, mounted on a flying drone at a high altitude to obtain a global view of the whole scene and all subjects on the ground, and multiple
horizontal-view cameras, worn by selected subjects, to obtain a local view of their nearby persons and environment details. We present an efficient top- and horizontal-view data fusion strategy to mapmultiplehorizontalviewsintotheglobaltopview.We then propose a spatial-temporal CIP potential energy function that jointly considers both intra-frame confidence and inter-frame consistency, thus leading to an effective Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation. We also construct a complementary-view video dataset, which provides a benchmark for the study of multi-view co-interest person detection. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

We show the CIP detection results on sample frames from the top-view and three horizontal-view videos in the following figure. Red and green boxes indicate the detected CIP and the ground truth, respectively. Frames with a solid blue star on the top-left corner indicate that no CIP is detected by our algorithm, e.g., they are drawn from the CIP’s egocentric video or the CIP is occluded in these frames. As shown in the figure, the proposed algorithm can detect CIP even if the CIP shows similar appearance and motion characteristics with other people. We can see that the proposed method can combine multiple horizontal views and a complementary top view for more comprehensive and accurate CIP detection.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Keras
- Imutils

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install keras
pip install imutils
```

## Usage

The code uses a pre-trained neural network model (`saved_model.h5`) to detect abnormal events in video streams. The main logic of the code is as follows:

1. Load the pre-trained neural network model using Keras.
2. Read video frames from the specified video file.
3. Process each frame to extract features for anomaly detection.
4. Calculate the mean squared loss (MSE) between the original frame and the reconstructed frame obtained from the model.
5. Temporal smoothing: Apply a smoothing factor to the loss values to reduce noise.
6. Dynamically adjust the threshold for anomaly detection based on past scores.
7. If the smoothed loss exceeds the threshold, an abnormal event is detected.

The code continuously processes video frames and displays the video with detected abnormal events marked.

Has PWA ready web front end. Meant to make property monitoring faster without need to watch video recordings.","![Open-Intelligence-title-logo](docs/img/oi_title_logo.png)


⚠️ <b>Notice:</b> due to lack of my own interest towards this project, I have decided to archive this project  ⚠️
<br>
<br>

Open Intelligence processes <b>any camera</b> motion triggered images and sorts seen objects using Yolo, it provides
easy to use front end web interface with rich features so that you can have up to date intel what is the current status
on your property. Open Intelligence uses license plate detection (ALPR)
to detect vehicle plates and face detection to detect people faces which then can be sorted into person folders and then
can be trained so that Open Intelligence can try to identify seen people. All this can be done from front end interface.

Open Intelligence uses super resolution neural network to process super resolution images for improved license plate
detection.

Project goal is to be useful information gathering tool to provide data for easy property monitoring without need for
expensive camera systems because any existing cameras are suitable.

I developed this to my own use because were tired to use existing monitoring tools to go through recorded video. I
wanted to know what has been happening quickly.

Open Intelligence is meant to be run with Docker.

Environment
============

Everything can be installed on one server or to separate servers meaning that database is at server one, python
application at server two and api hosting at server three. Processes must have access to output storage containing 
processed image result files.

![Environment](docs/environment.png)


Installing with Docker
============
This section has step-by-step installation tutorial to get started with Docker based installation. Docker way of running
Open-Intelligence is not going to limit you for only Docker, you can still run for example api, front-end, app.py,
similarity processes with Docker and have separate GPU enabled machine for super resolution and insightface processes.

### 1. Install database

Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and install it on any machine you want on your network. Look over
with search engine how to make it available on local network devices if you are installing it on a different machine
than what is running Docker images.

### 2. Install Docker

If you don't already have, go to [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and follow
their instructions.

### 3. Install Docker Compose

If you don't already have, go to [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install//](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install//) and follow
their instructions.

### 4. Clone this repository code

Use any version control tool to clone this repository code. I recommend using any git based tool so that you can
checkout latest code and by recommend, I mean don't download it as ""offline"" zip file.

Using git from shell:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence.git
```

### 5. Get models

Get models here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dSJuxpwSFfF7SIJg8NMKG5yCIG9CHQKw/view?usp=sharing
unzip models into open intelligence `/python/models` folder.

### 6. Configure

1. Rename `docker-compose.yml_tpl` into `docker-compose.yml` and fill in your environment variables which pretty much
   are database configuration.

### 7. Verify your timezone (linux server distro case)

https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Linux-notes#ensure-your-timezone-is-right

### 8. Configure storage
On linux machine configuring storage steps are:

Open docker-compose.yml and tweak all volume configs
```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./python/:/app
      - /Users/<user-name>/Desktop/camera_root:/input
      - /Users/<user-name>/Desktop/output:/output_test
```
where first part `/Users/<user-name>/Desktop/camera_root` is your path to your host machine folder. 
Same with another output folder path. Its just some folder in your machine where you want all open intelligence
output files to be stored.

That latter part like `:/input` and `:/output_test` is how python process sees paths in container side. 
It does not affect any way to your actual mounted folders so better not change these. 

More on this article: https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Configuring-storage

### 9. Run

1. Run `docker-compose up` in root of this project and let magic happen.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/` and you should see Open Intelligence front page. Hopefully.


### 10. Configuration from UI

1. Go to Configuration page and fill in your details. Content settings are explained at
   configuration page.
2. Run `docker-compose up` again so that changes takes effect in python side.


Updating to the latest version
============

Run at root of this project:

```shell
git fetch
git pull
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Python Apps
============
This part is explaining in better detail what each of base python app scripts is meant for. Many tasks are separated for
each part. App.py is always main process, the first thing that sees images.

App
-----

* File: `App.py`
* Status: *Mandatory*
* This is main app which is responsible for processing input images from configured sources.
* Cluster support: Yes.

StreamGrab
-----

* File: `StreamGrab.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* If you don't have cameras which are outputting images, you can configure multiple camera streams using this stream
  grabber tool to create constant input images.
* Cluster support: No.

SuperResolution
-----

* File: `SuperResolution.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* This tool processes super resolution images and run's new detections for these processed sr images. This is no way
  mandatory for process.
* Cluster support: No.
* Mainly meant for improved license plate detection.
* Testing: use command `python SuperResolutionTest.py --testfile=""some_file.jpg""` which will load image by given name
  from `/images` folder.

InsightFace
-----

* File: `InsightFace.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* Process faces page 'face wall' images using InsightFace retina model.
* Cluster support: No.

SimilarityProcess
-----

* File: `SimilarityProcess.py`
* Status: *Optional*
* Compares current running day images for close duplicates and deletes images determined as duplicate having no higher
  value (no detection result). Processes images in one hour chunks.
* Cluster support: No.
* Process is trying to save some space.



Installing manually
============
This is no longer recommended. Using docker method is much better.

Terminology for words like API side and Python side:

* ""API Side"" is `/api` folder containing node api process `intelligence.js`.
* ""Python side"" is `/python` folder containing different python processes.

See [Project folder structure](#project-folder-structure)  for more details about folders.

API side
-----

1. Go to `/api` folder and run `npm install`
2. Install PostgreSQL server: https://www.postgresql.org/
    * Accessing postgres you need to find tool like pgAdmin which comes with postgres, command line or some IDE having
      db tools.
3. Rename `.env_tpl` to `.env` and fill details.
4. Run `intelligence-tasks.js` or with PM2 process manager `pm2 start intelligence-tasks.js`.
5. Run `node intelligence.js` or with PM2 process manager `pm2 start intelligence.js -i 2`.
6. Running these NodeJS scripts will create database and table structures, if you see error run it again.
7. Go to `/front-end` folder and rename `.env_tpl` to `.env`.
8. At `/front-end` run `npm start` so you have both api and front end running.
9. Access `localhost:3000` if react app doesn't open browser window automatically.
10. Outdated frontend user manual for old ui
    version https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BwjXO0tUM9aemt1zNzofSY-DKeno321zeqpcmPI-wEw/edit?usp=sharing

Build react front end
-----

1. Go to `/front-end`
2. Check your `.env` REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL that it corresponds your machine ip address where node js api is running.
3. Build react front end via running `npm run build`
4. Copy/replace `/build` folder contents somewhere to serve build webpage if you want.

Python side
-----
(Windows)

1. Download Python 3.6 ( https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-amd64.exe )
    * Only tested to work with Python 3.6. Newer ones caused problems with packages when tested.
2. Jump to `/python` folder
3. Activate python virtual env.
   ```shell script
   .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
4. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements_windows.txt`
5. Get models using these instruction https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Models
6. Download PostgreSQL server ( https://www.postgresql.org/ ) I am using version <b>11.6</b> but its also tested with
   version 12. (if you didn't install at upper api section)
7. Ensure you have `Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x64)` installed.
    * This is needed by openALPR
8. Separate camera and folder names with comma just like at base config template
9. Run wanted python apps, see `Python Apps` section.



Python side
-----
(Linux)

1. Install required Python version.
    ```shell script
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt-get install python3.6
    virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 ./
   source ./bin/activate
    ```
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements_linux.txt`
3. Get models using these instruction https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence/wiki/Models
4. Download PostgreSQL server ( https://www.postgresql.org/ ) I am using version <b>11.6</b> but its also tested with
   version 12. (if you didn't install at upper api section)
5. Separate camera and folder names with comma just like at base config template
6. Run wanted python apps, see `Python Apps` section.



Multi node support
============
Multi node support requires little more work to configure, but it's doable. Follow instructions below.

1. Each node needs to have access to source files hosted by one main node via network share.
2. Create configuration file `config_slave.ini` from template `config_slave.ini.tpl`
3. Fill in postgres connection details having server running postgres as target location.
4. Fill [camera] section folders, these should be behind same mount letter+path on each node.
5. Point your command prompt into network share folder containing `App.py` and other files.
6. On each slave node run `App.py` via giving argument: `\.App.py --bool_slave_node True`

Cuda GPU Support
============
Cuda only works with some processes like super resolution and insightface. Requirements are:

1. NVIDIA only; GPU hardware compute capability: The minimum required Cuda capability is 3.5 so old GPU's won't work.
2. CUDA toolkit version. Windows link for right 10.0
   is https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64
3. Download cuDNN ""Download cuDNN v7.6.3 (August 23, 2019), for CUDA
   10.0"" https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive
4. Place cuDNN files inside proper Cuda toolkit installation folders. cuDNN archive has folder structure.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Postgresql notes
============
All datetime fields are inserted without timezone so that:

```
File     : 2020-01-03 08:51:43
Database : 2020-01-03 06:51:43.000000
```

Database timestamps are shifted on use based on local time offset.


Openalpr notes
============
These notes are for Windows. Current Docker way makes this installation automatic.

Got it running with following works. Downloaded `2.3.0` release from here https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/releases

1. Unzipped `openalpr-2.3.0-win-64bit.zip` to `/libraries` folder
2. Downloaded and unzipped `Source code(zip)`
3. Navigated to `src/bindings/python`
4. Run `python setup.py install`
5. From appeared `build/lib` moved contents to project `libraries/openalpr_64/openalpr` folder.
6. At license plate detection file imported contents with `from libraries.openalpr_64.openalpr import Alpr`

Now works without any python site-package installation.

This program uses an object detection deep learning model and a re-identification model to find and track the objects in a movie. Then, the program will track the trajectory of the objects and check if the objects cross the defined virtual lines or the objects are inside the defined areas. The program uses [Intel(r) Distribution of OpenVINO(tm) toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for deep learning inferencing.    
To track the objects, the program extracts the feature vectors from the objects which consists of 256 FP values with the re-identification DL model. The program can identify which object is most similar to the objects in the previous frame and record the trajectory. The L2 norm (or the distance) of those feature vectores represents the similarity of the objects. This program uses cosine distance to check the similarity between the objects.  
The line crossing check and area intrusion check are done by regular (meaning, non deep learning based) arithmetic algorithm.  
The latest version playbacks sound when an event such as crossing a line or entering to an area happens.  
You can learn how to use line-crossing and area intrusion function from simple test program (`test-line-cross-area-intrusion.py`)  

このプログラムはディープラーニングの物体検出モデルと特徴抽出(re-identification)モデルを用いて、ムービーフレーム中のオブジェクトを検出し、追跡するプログラムです。プログラムは見つけたオブジェクトの軌跡を記録し、オブジェクトが定義された仮想ラインを超えたり定義されたエリアに侵入したことを検出します。ディープラーニングの推論には[Intel(r) Distribution of OpenVINO(tm) toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit)を利用しています。  
オブジェクトの追跡のために、プログラムは特徴抽出モデルを使用して見つけたオブジェクトから256個の浮動小数点数値からなる特徴ベクトルを抽出します。この特徴ベクトル同士のL2ノルム(=距離)がオブジェクト同士の類似度を表します。このプログラムではノルムの計算にコサイン距離を使用しています。  
ラインクロスとエリア侵入の判定には通常の(ディープラーニングベースではない)数学的アルゴリズムを使用しています。  
最新版はラインクロスしたりエリア侵入したりなどのイベント発生時にオーディオを再生します。  
コードを簡素化したテストプログラムも追加しました。ライン交差やエリア侵入判定関数の使い方などを学ぶことが可能です。(`test-line-cross-area-intrusion.py`)  

[ Update - 04-Apr-2022 ] OpenVINO API 2.0 support. Program is now compatible with OpenVINO 2022.1 (and not compatible with OpenVINO 2021 and older ones)

# **SPHAR**: **S**urveillance **P**erspective **H**uman **A**ction **R**ecognition Dataset


**SPHAR** is a video dataset for **human action recognition**. Its main purpose is to support research in the application area of analyzing activities on public places.

In this domain, most cameras will share a similar mounting angle and perspective, which we will call the **surveillance perspective** from now on. In **SPHAR**, all videos are shot from this or a similar perspective.

The videos have been aggregated from multiple sources, converted to a consistent file type (`H265 HEVC .mp4`), cutted and cropped (spatio-temporally) to contain only one action at a time and last but not least sorted into 14 action classes.

This Repository contains all videos of the SPHAR dataset as well as the [scripts](scripts) needed to create the dataset.

Head over to the [S-SPHAR repository](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/S-SPHAR-Dataset), if you are looking for a synthetically generated dataset of this perspective.

## Known Caveats
Due to different and missing annotations in the original datasets, not all videos could be automatically cropped to the relevant area containing the action.

- The videos of the UCF-ARG and CASIA datasets are only cutted temporally. 
- The videos of the UCF-Crime, CAVIAR and Live Videos datasets are neither cropped nor cutted and might contain camera changes or watermarks. 
- Videos extracted from the MEVA, Okutama, Bit-Interaction, UCF-Aerial, VIRAT Ground and UT-Interaction datasets are both cropped and cutted to relevant actions, but the quality of the cut heavily depends on the quality of the original annotations and therefore varies by each dataset.

You can delete the videos you don't need using a simple filename search, as the video names contain abbreviations for each dataset.

## Download
The easiest way to just get the dataset videos is by downloading one of our [releases](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/SPHAR-Dataset/releases):

- [**SPHAR-Dataset-1.0.zip**](https://github.com/AlexanderMelde/SPHAR-Dataset/archive/1.0.zip)

If you want to modify the dataset and use the conversion and cutting scripts, clone or fork this repository using:

```
git clone git@github.com:AlexanderMelde/SPHAR-Dataset.git
```

## License
Using the datasets for researching purposes is possible for all of the videos, but licensing is difficult when aggregating data from multiple sources and licenses.

All videos of this dataset contain a reference to the original dataset source in their filename. You must refer to the original licensing conditions for each video / dataset and filter out (remove) any videos you are not licensed to use (see table above).

The work of the **SPHAR Dataset** (aggregation, converting and cropping scripts) - but not the videos itself - are released under the **GNU GPL v3** license (contact me for further licensing options).

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.

## Citation
Please note that none of the supplied videos have been recorded by myself.
**Please attribute the original authors wherever possible.**
