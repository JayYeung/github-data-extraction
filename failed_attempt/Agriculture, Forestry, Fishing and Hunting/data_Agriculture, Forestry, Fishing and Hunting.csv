## About

OpenIIoT is a cross-platform (via Mono) application platform for the (Industrial) Internet of Things written in C#.  The code in this repository is a work in progress and is presently on hiatus while a web framework is evaluated and selected for front-end development.

Feel free to email <info@openiiot.org> with any questions.

If you'd like to demo the front end, skip to the [demo](#demo) section.

## Concept

The concept is straightforward; the application gathers data from industrial control system assets and moves it somewhere else.  Where the application can get data from, as well as where it can send the data to, is determined by the available plugins.  

The following concept diagram outlines the functionality from a high level:

![concept overview](doc/img/concept.png) 

Plugins come in the form of .NET binaries, and capabilities are extended by the implementation of one or more interfaces (documentation TBD).  The interfaces implemented by plugins determine the functionality, but generally plugins will fall into either the category of ""connector"", which allows the application to retrieve data from various places, or ""endpoint"", which allows the application to send data.

Also pluggable are repository interfaces, however this is not shown in the concept diagram.  Repository plugins are essentially database abstractions.

In addition to Endpoints, the application provides a number of core services, primarily a robust set of RESTful APIs, a real-time data streaming engine (SignalR), and a static file server.  This functionality allows for user-defined web applications to be hosted by the application, and in turn these application consume the available APIs to display and manipulate data.  Future functionality includes MQTT and probably an OPC-UA server.

## Architecture

Up-to-date documentation for the software architecture isn't available, however the present state pretty closely reflects the original concept designed some time around 2010:

![architecture](doc/img/architecture.png)

Notable changes are the addition of SignalR and the static web server, the abandonment of an ODBC interface, and the repositioning of the data model as the central element of the application.

The application wasn't imagined to be pluggable at the time this was made, so there's a bunch of architectural details around that as well.

## Demo

A recent build of the application has been deployed to an AWS EC2 instance for demo purposes.  The demo can be accessed at [http://demo.openiiot.org](http://demo.openiiot.org); use 'admin' for both the username and password, without quotes.

Note that there's nothing else on this server but the demo application, and the application hasn't been secured.  If you find that something isn't working properly or has perhaps been defaced, please create an [issue](https://github.com/OpenIIoT/OpenIIoT.Core/issues) or email <info@openiiot.org>.

## Screenshots

### Dashboard

The application takes a hands-off approach to performance; due to the range of hardware upon which it will run (primarily single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi) and the variety of things that can be done with it, whoever is responsible for configuration needs to keep an eye on the performance characteristics and offload functionality if needed.

The dashboard provides administrators with a quick view of the present CPU, memory and hard drive usage of the host machine.  Additional metrics such as swap (*nix) and paging and Ethernet activity will probably be added later.

![dashboard](doc/img/dashboard.png)

Also available on the dashboard are real-time application logs.  These are presently full of API requests because the application is running with debug logging enabled.

### Sine Wave

The demo contains a few different examples of the types of data visualization that can be achieved; the most comprehensive of which is the Sine Wave graph.

![sine wave](doc/img/sine.png)

This screen demonstrates the application streaming a real-time data item from the application, in this case an array, and displaying the data in a browser.

The current update rate at the back end is 50 milliseconds, and as can be seen in the browser the unbroken sine wave depicted in the graph illustrates that neither the back end nor the real-time data pipe drops frames (on most systems, under most conditions).

### Database

The back end model is completely agnostic about the data it contains, and to illustrate this the Database display was created:

![database display](doc/img/database.png)

This information is fetched from a SQL database (AWS RDS), piped through the application, and sent to the browser as a simple JSON object.

This screen, like most, uses a SignalR connection to display data in real-time, although the database is presently static so no data changes.  If you see data updating on this screen I have since scheduled a task to change it periodically.

### API

The various APIs exposed by the application are fully documented using [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle) annotations in the code.  This allows for use with [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/), which has been customized to better match the look and feel of the front end:

![api](doc/img/api.png)

This interface can be accessed via the 'API' menu, or directly at [http://demo.openiiot.org/help](http://demo.openiiot.org/help).

Note that these APIs are very much a work in progress, and presently the only two endpoints which are in a presentable state are the two which are expanded in the screenshot, Security and Packaging.

## Documentation

Code documentation is generated with [Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB) and is updated somewhat regularly at [http://openiiot.org](http://openiiot.org).

 In this project, we are providing a farmer friendly web-based app that gives complete information about what crop to grow, what fertilizers and pesticides to use depending upon land condition and weather conditions.
 
 It also provides a platform that connects farmers directly to consumers or retailers thus, eliminates middlemen. This web application can be used by both farmers as well as retailers/consumers accordingly.

**Objective: Build a project that is functionally similar to [this](https://shyakaster.github.io/FCCTDP/)**

**Fulfill the below user stories. Feel free to give it your own personal style.**

*Remember this project is meant only to measure the skills you acquired in your ALC journey and does not in anyway affect your qualification to enter into the Andela bootcamp.*

>You are required to use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. In your bootcamp journey you will be require to use vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript so some practice here would help you a lot.
> Happy coding!

**Follow the following user stories to complete your challenge**

**User Story #1:** I can see a main element with a corresponding id=""main-doc"", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

**User Story #2:** Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.

**User Story #3:** The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

**User Story #4:** Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header ""Javascript and Java"" should have a corresponding id=""Javascript_and_Java"").

**User Story #5:** The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
  
**User Story #6:** The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

**User Story #7:** The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

**User Story #8:** I can see a nav element with a corresponding id=""navbar"".

**User Story #9:** The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

**User Story #10:** Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.

**User Story #11:** The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

**User Story #12:** Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a ""Hello world"" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text ""Hello world"").

**User Story #13:** When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text ""Hello world"", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

**User Story #14:** On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id=""navbar"" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

**User Story #15:** My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

A Koi breeding game. Get it [on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1518810/Koi_Farm) or [on itch.io](https://jobtalle.itch.io/koifarm).

[![alt text](screenshots.png ""Koi Farm"")](https://youtu.be/2JS6PEr1jUo)

## Building

HTML, CSS and Javascript content is compressed using [squish.py](https://github.com/jobtalle/squish.py), which is included in this repository as a submodule. Before building, ensure that this library has been cloned as well.

Make sure [node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) and [python 3](https://www.python.org/) are installed. After calling `npm i` to install all required packages, the following commands can be used to create binaries using [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron):

| Operating system | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Windows (32 bit) | `npm run build-win-32` |
| Windows (64 bit) | `npm run build-win-64` |
| Linux (64 bit) | `npm run build-linux-64` |
| Mac (64 bit) | `npm run build-mac-64` |

Additionally, `npm run compress` can be called to compress HTML, CSS and Javscript content without building binaries. The compressed HTML file `release.html` will be created in the project root. The file requires the `audio`, `font`, `svg` and `language` directories to run, as well as `favicon.ico` and `manifest.json`.

## Translations

The game is available in several languages. Translations can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/jobtalle/KoiTranslations), and new translations can be proposed there; when new translations are made, I will add them to the game.

## Contributing

Contributions can be proposed by submitting pull requests. The best place to ask questions is in [the official discord](https://discord.gg/bw3ZFe63Qg), which has a dedicated channel for source code related discussions.

CGRU is the Computer Graphics Tools Pack.

It consists of the main tools _Afanasy_ and _Rules_.
Other tools are arranged as satellites around these two,
like _dailies encoding scripts_ and _software submission plug-ins_.

**Afanasy** is a render farm manager.

**Rules** is a Web based CG projects tracker.

[Site](https://cgru.info)

[Documentation](https://cgru.readthedocs.io)

[Forum](https://forum.cgru.info)

You can ask any questions on the CGRU forum.

GitHub issues are used for code development and bug tracking.

### Coding rules:

- Indentation - TABS. You can vary tab length, default 4 spaces length is normal.
	- Python Indentation - SPACES(4). It is not a problem to tune any modern text editor for each file type.
- Code alignment - SPACES, it should not break on various tab length.
- Variable names: variable_name.
- Function names: functionName.
- Class names: ClassName.
- Use prefixes to make code more readable:
	- `i_` - Input variables.
	- `o_` - Output variables.
	- `m_` - Class members.
	- `ms_` - Static class members.
	- `g_` - External variables.
	- `v_` - Virtual functions.
- Do not use ""!"" as NOT, since it is not noticeable for doing code review. It is much more easy to notice `false == `.
- Use `false == var` and `NULL == val` instead of `var == false` or `var == NULL`.
As if you miss one '=' character, it will not be an error, it will be assignment, not comparison.
- Use `const &` to pass complex types as function parameters to not to copy class instance.

#### Example:

```c
// Function with long parameters list:
bool someFunction(std::string &o_status, const std::string &i_param1, const std::string &i_param2,
	const std::string &i_param3, const std::string &i_param4)
{
	...

	if (false == variable_name)
	{
		o_status = ""error"";
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
```

You will notice, that some parts of the code are not following these rules. This
is mostly because such code has been written before these rules were created or
changed.

The typical file header and code style for C++ and JS files can automatically be applied with the script 
[utilities/maintenance/codeStyleCheck.php](https://github.com/CGRU/cgru/blob/master/utilities/maintenance/codeStyleCheck.php) see the file for instructions of setup and usage. 

The file header shall contain as much information as possible about the file, you can find a good example here:
[afanasy/browser/monitor.js](https://github.com/CGRU/cgru/blob/master/afanasy/browser/monitor.js)
### Some names:
**CGRU** - came from CG - Rules. It has two meanings: computer graphics principles and computer graphics is a cool thing.

**Afanasy** - came from a Greek name meaning [immortal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afanasy). 

**Rules** - simple came from rules! This project tracker is based on defined rules.
Mostly project structure rules, where to store sources, references, dailies, outputs.
As Rules does not have its own database, it walks file-server folders structure.

## TL;DR;

```console
$ helm install openstf
```

## Introduction

This project contains a chart that bootstraps an OpenSTF deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

# Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster with KVM-capable nodes for emulators
- [helm](https://helm.sh)
- [rethinkdb installation](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/rethinkdb)
- [adb-butler](https://github.com/agoda-com/adb-butler) image
- [docker-emulator-android](https://github.com/agoda-com/docker-emulator-android) images

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm install --name my-release openstf
```

The command deploys OpenSTF on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

You need to set `emulators.imagePrefix` and `adb.image.repository` values to the images of [docker-emulator-android](https://github.com/agoda-com/docker-emulator-android) and [adb-butler](https://github.com/agoda-com/adb-butler) you've built in order for the chart to work properly. This can be done either in `values.yaml` or via the command-line. The full installation will look something like:

```console
$ helm install --name openstf -f openstf/values.yaml \
    --set emulators.imagePrefix=docker-registry/agoda/docker-emulator-android- \
    --set emulators.imageVersion=1.0.0 \
    --set adb.image.repository=docker-registry/agoda/adb-butler \
    --set pullSecret=docker-registry-secret \
    --set ingress.enabled=true \
    --set ingress.hostname=openstf.svc.cluster.local \
    --set ingress.ssl.enabled=true \
    --set ingress.ssl.secret=ssl-secret \
    --set rethinkdb.password=strongpassword \
    openstf
```

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

# Nodes configuration
You need to label and taint the usb provider nodes and kvm nodes as following

USB providers:
```
$ kubectl label nodes node-x.cluster.local openstf.io/provider=true
$ kubectl taint nodes node-x.cluster.local openstf.io/provider=true:NoSchedule
```

Emulator nodes:
```
$ kubectl label nodes node-x.cluster.local openstf.io/emulator=kvm
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](openstf/values.yaml)

## Pod resources
All the pods have sane default resources set. To customize check the [values.yaml](openstf/values.yaml)

## Emulators
In order to create emulators you need to provide configuration inside `emulators.types`. For example you want the to name the batch of devices `tablet7i`, add `ci/uiTest/tablet/7inch` note to all these devices in OpenSTF and change the `config.ini` variable for emulator. You also want 3 instances of such config with API version 26 and 3 instances with API version 19.

```YAML
- name: tablet7i
  note: ci/uiTest/tablet/7inch
  args: ""skin.name=600x1024;hw.lcd.density=160;hw.lcd.height=600;hw.lcd.width=1024;hw.device.name=7in WSVGA (Tablet);avd.ini.displayname=7  WSVGA (Tablet) API 23;""
  instances:
  - version: 26
    count: 3
  - version: 19
    count: 3
```

By default you'll have phones with API versions 17 to 26 and 7' + 10' tablets with API version 25.

## Welcome to LoL Bot
- This is a python bot that uses the local League Client API to start games and plays them with a simple but effective game loop.
- This bot has leveled up [thousands of league accounts](https://www.playerauctions.com/lol-account/) and is still going strong.
- No pixel botting and/or image recognition makes it easy to run on any setup.

</p>

## Current Features
- Start League and Login
- Start a Beginner Bot Game
- Buy items and somewhat intelligently push mid until the game is over
- End game, earn experience, collect rewards
- Loop 🥡🧋

## Requirements
- [Python >= 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [League of Legends](https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/download)
- [League of Legends Account](https://signup.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/signup/index)

## Setup
- Ensure Python is added to your PATH, check ""Add Python to PATH"" when [installing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDbDIhR76H4)
- Clone the repo or Download the [latest release](https://github.com/iholston/lol-bot/releases)
- Download [extra RAM](https://downloadmoreram.com/) (only if needed)
- Run Installer.bat or ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Optional Configuration
- constants.py
  - For non-standard league install paths, update the ```LEAGUE_CLIENT_DIR``` 
  - To level accounts past level 30, update ```ACCOUNT_MAX_LEVEL``` 
  - To change the game mode update ```GAME_LOBBY_ID``` with another lobby id. (*Note*: the bot is designed for beginner or itermediate bots, lobby id: 840/850) 
- account.py
  - To continuously level new league accounts, implement account.py to connect to your database of league accounts.
  - For a simple implementation, add your accounts to the accounts.json file in the resources folder and copy accounts.py from the resources folder into the scripts folder

For Virtual Machine setups, I recommend starting with [this forum](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/league-of-legends/480977-run-league-legends-virtual-machine-vmware.html). *Note:* I will not be fixing/troubleshooting VM related issues as there are far too many VM implementation/platform specific issues

The League of Legends accounts should already have accepted the riot promise, set a username, and skipped the tutorials. The bot will automatically change your league settings/configuration and the game window (not the client) should open as a 1024x720 window

A parser for USDA plant hardiness zones. That data is provided in bulk by [the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/projects/plant_hardiness_zones.php). This combines the four bulk files with ZIP location data, and creates a JSON file for each ZIP, functioning as a static API.

Note that _not every U.S. ZIP code is part of this dataset._ The PHZ source data, provided by PRISM, does not include every ZIP, and there is no complete list of the location of all ZIP codes in the PHZ source data.

The resulting data is used to create an API at phzmapi.org, in format `{ZIPCODE}.json`, e.g. [`https://phzmapi.org/20001.json`](https://phzmapi.org/20001.json).

![Map of the U.S.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/656758/8011208/c1b7ea48-0b84-11e5-967b-a496cdfe0fe0.jpg)

(Per PRISM Climate Group's Terms of Service, note that the above map is not the official USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.)

## Run It Yourself

`./frostline.py`

## Map The Data

You can generate a nice interactive map of the data. First convert the data to GeoJSON:

```
node map.js
```

This creates `map.geojson`. Then view `map.html` in a browser. You will need to serve the map on a simple web server (not at a `file://` URL) so that it can access the GeoJSON file on disk (`file://` URLs block access to other files). That was used by Josh Tauberer to generate the above map.

## Plant Hardiness Zones

This is the national standard for knowing which plants will grow where. It’s determined based on the average annual minimum temperature over the prior 30 years, with each zone comprising a 10°F band. There are 26 zones in all. The standard was developed by the U.S., but other countries have adopted the same standard. Companies that sell plants, seeds, roots, and bulbs  (e.g., Burpee) use these zones to help customers understand what will thrive in their area, and to decide when to ship orders to help them to thrive. For more information, see [the Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone) or the [USDA’s explanation](http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/About.aspx).

PoShMon is an open source PowerShell-based server and farm monitoring solution. It's an ""agent-less"" monitoring tool, which means there's nothing that needs to be installed on any of the environments you want to monitor - you can simply run or schedule the script from a regular workstation and have it monitor a single server or group of servers, using PowerShell remoting. PoShMon is also able to monitor ""farm""-based products like SharePoint, in which multiple servers work together to provide a single platform. For details on why I built PoShMon, see the bottom of this page.

## Key Features
Some of the key features / benefits of PoShMon are:
* Agent-less Monitoring - nothing needs to be installed on the remote servers
* Core operating system and web-site monitoring
* Specialized SharePoint monitoring
* Supports frequent/critical as well as comprehensive daily monitoring
* Email, Pushbullet (mobile), Office 365 Teams (""Chat-ops"") and Twilio (SMS) notifications
* Provides a framework for a ['self-healing'](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/wiki/Creating-a-Self-Healing-System-Using-PoShMon) system

## Installation Instructions
PoShMon is available on the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PoShMon) so you can either download it from this GitHub page or even install it directly from the gallery onto your local workstation using

`PS> Install-Module -Name PoShMon`

## Prerequisites
While PoShMon is indeed ""agent-less"", it **does need to execute remote PowerShell commands** against the servers in question. As a result, you need to ensure that PowerShell remoting is correctly configured and also that you are running PoShMon under an account that has the correct rights to connect to the server remotely and execute the requisite commands. You also need to make sure you're not going to encounter the classic 'Double Hop' issue. If you're already remotely administering your environment you're probably fine, but have a look at the quick [Prerequisite Guide](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/wiki/Prerequisites) to confirm / set up what you need.

## Getting Started
(Below is a quick overview - for more, please visit the more complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/wiki/Getting-Started-With-PoShMon))
Once you've installed PoShMon, you can have a look at the [Samples](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/tree/master/src/0.4.0/Samples) folder to get an idea how to use it. As an example, to monitor a farm of web servers you can use

```
$poShMonConfiguration = New-PoShMonConfiguration {
                General `
                    -EnvironmentName 'Intranet Farm' `
                    -MinutesToScanHistory 15 `
                    -ServerNames 'WebServer1','WebServer2' `
                OperatingSystem `
                    -EventLogCodes 'Critical'
                WebSite `
                    -WebsiteDetails @{ 
                                        ""http://intranet"" = ""Read our terms""
                                     }
                Notifications -When OnlyOnFailure {
                    Email `
                        -ToAddress ""IntranetTeam@Company.com"" `
                        -FromAddress ""Monitoring@company.com"" `
                        -SmtpServer ""EXCHANGE.COMPANY.COM"" `
                }         
            }

$monitoringOutput = Invoke-OSMonitoring -PoShMonConfiguration $poShMonConfiguration
```

Some things to note on the above:

* The actual ""monitoring"" takes place on the last line with [`Invoke-OSMonitoring`](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/blob/master/src/0.4.0/Functions/PoShMon.OSMonitoring/Invoke-OSMonitoring.ps1). The lines above are just setting up your specific configuration.
* To make the config a little more readable, I've put each parameter on a new line (note the '`' PowerShell line-continuation character). This is not required, or course, so your configuration could be shorter.

Here's another example, to monitor a SharePoint farm

```
$poShMonConfiguration = New-PoShMonConfiguration {
                General -EnvironmentName 'SharePoint' -MinutesToScanHistory 1440 -PrimaryServerName 'SPAPPSVR01' -ConfigurationName SpFarmPosh -TestsToSkip ""SPDatabaseHealth""
                OperatingSystem -EventLogCodes 'Error','Warning'
                WebSite -WebsiteDetails @{ 
                                        ""http://intranet"" = ""Read our terms""
                                        ""http://extranet.company.com"" = ""Read our terms""
                                     }
                Notifications -When All {
                    Email -ToAddress ""SharePointTeam@Company.com"" -FromAddress ""Monitoring@company.com"" -SmtpServer ""EXCHANGE.COMPANY.COM""
                }
            }

$monitoringOutput = Invoke-SPMonitoring -PoShMonConfiguration $poShMonConfiguration
```

* Note the use of `PrimaryServerName` instead of `ServerNames`. Instead of a list of servers, you need only to supply PoShMon with details of a ""primary"" server (you can choose any of the SharePoint servers, but typically this is an ""application"" or ""batch"" server, on which the main monitoring work will occur) and it will use SharePoint's API to determine the remaining servers.
* Note also the use of [`Invoke-SPMonitoring`](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/blob/master/src/0.4.0/Functions/PoShMon.SharePoint/Invoke-SPMonitoring.ps1) instead of [`Invoke-OSMonitoring`](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/blob/master/src/0.4.0/Functions/PoShMon.OSMonitoring/Invoke-OSMonitoring.ps1). ""EnvironmentName"", which appears in notifications (emails etc.) is also changed to something more suitable.
* 'MinutesToScanHistory' is 1440 instead of 15, so this is more of a daily monitoring example. We've also got `Notifications -When All` instead of `Notifications -When OnlyOnFailure` because we want notifications (emails or similar) in all cases for daily monitoring, unlike for Critical monitoring where we only want to be alerted of major issues. This is also why the EventLogCodes have been changed.
* An important note for monitoring tests where direct access to the servers is required, like in SharePoint where certain commands need to be run remotely: In this case, remote PowerShell sessions are used and, to improve security, PowerShell sessions have been configured to run under appropriate user accounts. You can find out more about the related 'double-hop' issue [here](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ashleymcglone/2016/08/30/powershell-remoting-kerberos-double-hop-solved-securely/) and learn about how to configure remote sessions in this way (instead of using Kerberos or CredSSP) by visiting [this link](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sergey_babkins_blog/2015/03/18/another-solution-to-multi-hop-powershell-remoting/).
* Storing the output of the monitoring (`$monitoringOutput`) is not required, of course, but it's helpful if you want to do anything with it, like try [automatically correct regular issues in your environment](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/wiki/Creating-a-Self-Healing-System-Using-PoShMon).

After that, simply run the script and it will perform an on-demand monitoring of the servers or environments. Of course, you might like to schedule these monitoring tests to run automatically, so see the next section for how to do this.

## Scheduled Monitoring
Ad-hoc monitoring can be useful to troubleshoot specific issues, but mostly we want our monitoring to be automated and scheduled. Because PoShMon simply consists of PowerShell scripts, to have then be scheduled we can rely on simple Windows Task Scheduler, and just set the Tasks to run on a reasonable basis. Here are some [example Task Scheduler](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/tree/master/src/0.4.0/Samples/Scheduled%20Task%20Definitions) definitions that can be imported. The first runs ""Critical"" level monitoring, so it runs every 15 minutes, skips some of the longer-running and less essential tests and notifies only on failure, whereas the latter runs the full barrage of tests on a nightly basis and send a detailed breakdown.

## That's It!
That's all there is to it! Hopefully PoShMon is of use to you and of course feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/HiltonGiesenow/PoShMon/issues) to the project, there's tons more that can be done!

---

## A Note on Why I built PoShMon
Of course there are loads of monitoring systems and tools out there, both paid and free / open source ones. However, there are two main reasons I initially built PoShMon:

1. I wanted to grow my PowerShell knowledge and there didn't seem to be anything purely PowerShell based that could offer what I wanted

2. Many of the tools don't have a lot of product depth. For instance, many Windows monitoring tools can do basic disk / memory / event log monitoring for SharePoint servers but few can actually give me SharePoint-specific metrics, like how healthy the Search service is, what Timer jobs have failed,  or whether any of the servers need to be upgraded (note that many of these tests can be greatly improved). I'm hoping that PoShMon becomes the home for powerful, specialised monitoring of many other products and platforms, like Exchange, SQL Server, CRM and more.

Parallelo Parallel Library (PPL) is currently available on both GitHub and Crates.io. 

Please make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system before proceeding. If you don't have them installed, you can get them from the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

To use PPL in your Rust project, you can add the following in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
ppl = { git = ""https://github.com/valebes/ppl.git"" }
```

## Usage
### A Simple (but long) Example: Fibonacci pipeline
Here a simple example that show how create a pipeline that computes the first 20 numbers of Fibonacci.

This pipeline is composed by:
- **Source**: emits number from 1 to 20.
- **Stage**: computes the i-th number of Fibonacci.
- **Sink**: accumulates and return a Vec with the results.

Here a snipped of code to show how build this pipeline:
```rust
use ppl::{prelude::*, templates::misc::{SourceIter, Sequential, SinkVec}};

fn main() {
    let mut p = pipeline![
        SourceIter::build(1..21),
        Sequential::build(fib), // fib is a method that computes the i-th number of Fibonacci
        SinkVec::build()
    ];
    p.start();
    let res = p.wait_end().unwrap().len();
    assert_eq!(res, 20)
}
```

In this example we're building a simple pipeline, so why not use clousure instead than the library templates?
```rust
use ppl::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let mut p = pipeline![
        {
            let mut counter = 0; 
            move || { 
                if counter < 20 {
                    counter += 1;
                    Some(counter)
                } else {
                    None
                }
            }
        },
        |input| Some(fib(input)),
        |input| println!(""{}"", input)
    ];
    p.start();
    p.wait_end();
}
```

The run-time supports of the framework will call the clousure representing the Source till it returns `None`, when the Source returns `None` then a termination message will be propagated to the other stages of the pipeline.

If we want to parallelize the computation we must find a part of this algorithm that can be parallelized.
In this case the stage in the middle is a good candidate, we replicate that stage introducing a Farm.

Now the code is as follows:
```rust
use ppl::{prelude::*, templates::misc::{SourceIter, Parallel, SinkVec}};

fn main() {
    let mut p = pipeline![
        SourceIter::build(1..21),
        Parallel::build(8, fib), // We create 8 replicas of the stage seen in the previous code.
        SinkVec::build()
    ];
    p.start();
    let res = p.wait_end().unwrap().len();
    assert_eq!(res, 20)
}
```

If we don't want to use the templates offered by the library, there is the possibility to create custom stage.
By creating custom stages it is possible to build stateful and more complex nodes for our pipeline.

Here the same example but using custom defined stages:
```rust
use ppl::prelude::*;

struct Source {
    streamlen: usize,
    counter: usize,
}
impl Out<usize> for Source {
    // This method must be implemented in order to implement the logic of the node
    fn run(&mut self) -> Option<usize> {
        if self.counter < self.streamlen {
            self.counter += 1;
            Some(self.counter)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Worker {}
impl InOut<usize, usize> for Worker {
    // This method must be implemented in order to implement the logic of the node
    fn run(&mut self, input: usize) -> Option<usize> {
        Some(fib(input))
    }
    // We can override this method to specify the number of replicas of the stage
    fn number_of_replicas(&self) -> usize {
        8
    }
}

struct Sink {
    counter: usize,
}
impl In<usize, usize> for Sink {
    // This method must be implemented in order to implement the logic of the node
    fn run(&mut self, input: usize) {
        println!(""{}"", input);
        self.counter += 1;
    }
    // If at the end of the stream we want to return something, we can do it by implementing this method.
    fn finalize(self) -> Option<usize> {
        println!(""End"");
        Some(self.counter)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut p = pipeline![
        Source {
            streamlen: 20,
            counter: 0
        },
        Worker {},
        Sink { counter: 0 }
    ];

    p.start();
    let res = p.wait_end(); // Here we will get the counter returned by the Sink
    assert_eq!(res.unwrap(), 20);
}
```

Surely is more verbose, but allows to express a more variety of parallel computations in which each node can be stateful. Also, thanks to this approach, it is possible to build templates for stages that can be reused in different pipelines and/or projects.

Parallelo also offers a powerful work-stealing threadpool. Using that instead, we can express the same parallel computation as following:

```rust
use ppl::thread_pool::ThreadPool;

fn main() {
    let tp = ThreadPool::new(); // We create a new threadpool
    for i in 1..21 {
        tp.execute(move || {
            fib(i);
        });
    }
    tp.wait(); // Wait till al worker have finished
}
```

If we don't want to wait the threads explicitly, we can create a parallel scope.
At the end of the scope, all the threads are guaranteed to have finished their jobs.
This can be done with the following code:

```rust
use ppl::thread_pool::ThreadPool;

fn main() {
    let tp = ThreadPool::new(); // We create a new threadpool
    tp.scope(|s| {
        for i in 1..21 {
            s.execute(move || {
                fib(i);
            });
        }
    }); // After this all threads have finished
}
```

### A More Complex Example: Word Counter

To demonstrate the capabilities of Parallelo Parallel Library (PPL), let's consider a common problem: counting the occurrences of words in a text dataset. This example showcases how PPL can significantly speed up computations by leveraging parallelism.

#### Problem

The task is to count the occurrences of each word in a given text dataset. This involves reading the dataset, splitting it into individual words, normalizing the words (e.g., converting to lowercase and removing non-alphabetic characters), and finally, counting the occurrences of each word.

#### Approach 1: Pipeline

The pipeline approach in PPL provides an intuitive and flexible way to express complex parallel computations. In this approach, we construct a pipeline consisting of multiple stages, each performing a specific operation on the data. The data flows through the stages, with parallelism automatically applied at each stage.

In the word counter example, the pipeline involves the following stages:
- **Source**: Reads the dataset and emits lines of text.
- **Map**: Converts each line of text into a list of words, where each word is paired with a count of 1.
- **Reduce**: Aggregates the counts of words by summing them for each unique word.
- **Sink**: Stores the final word counts in a hashmap.

By breaking down the computation into stages and leveraging parallelism, PPL's pipeline approach allows for efficient distribution of work across multiple threads or cores, leading to faster execution.

Here's the Rust code for the word counter using the pipeline approach:

```rust
use ppl::{
    templates::map::{Map, Reduce},
    prelude::*,
};

struct Source {
    reader: BufReader<File>,
}

impl Out<Vec<String>> for Source {
    // Implementation details...
}

struct Sink {
    counter: HashMap<String, usize>,
}
impl In<Vec<(String, usize)>, Vec<(String, usize)>> for Sink {
    fn run(&mut self, input: Vec<(String, usize)>) {
        // Increment value for key in hashmap
        // If key does not exist, insert it with value 1
        for (key, value) in input {
            let counter = self.counter.entry(key).or_insert(0);
            *counter += value;
        }
    }
    fn finalize(self) -> Option<Vec<(String, usize)>> {
        Some(self.counter.into_iter().collect())
    }
}

pub fn ppl(dataset: &str, threads: usize) {
    // Initialization and configuration...

    let mut p = pipeline![
        Source { reader },
        Map::build::<Vec<String>, Vec<(String, usize)>>(threads / 2, |str| -> (String, usize) {
            (str, 1)
        }),
        Reduce::build(threads / 2, |str, count| {
            let mut sum = 0;
            for c in count {
                sum += c;
            }
            (str, sum)
        }),
        Sink {
            counter: HashMap::new(),
        },
    ];

    p.start();
    let res = p.wait_end();
}
```
#### Approach 2: Thread Pool

Alternatively, PPL also provides a thread pool for parallel computations. In this approach, we utilize the `par_map_reduce` function of the thread pool to perform the word counting task.

The thread pool approach in PPL involves the following steps:
- Create a thread pool with the desired number of threads.
- Read the dataset and collect all the lines into a vector.
- Use the `par_map_reduce` function to parallelize the mapping and reducing operations on the vector of words.
- The mapping operation converts each word into a tuple with a count of 1.
- The reducing operation aggregates the counts of words by summing them for each unique word.

Using the thread pool, PPL efficiently distributes the work across the available threads, automatically managing the parallel execution and resource allocation.

```rust
use ppl::prelude::*;

pub fn ppl_map(dataset: &str, threads: usize) {
    // Initialization and configuration...

    let file = File::open(dataset).expect(""no such file"");
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);

    // We can also create custom-sized thread pool
    let mut tp = ThreadPool::with_capacity(threads);

    let mut words = Vec::new();

    reader.lines().map(|s| s.unwrap()).for_each(|s| words.push(s));

    let res = tp.par_map_reduce(
        words
            .iter()
            .flat_map(|s| s.split_whitespace())

### An Advanced Example: Single-Input Multi-Output stage

In this example, we demonstrate how to model a data processing pipeline using PPL, where a stage produces multiple outputs for each input received.

This pipeline involves the following stages:
- **Source**: Generates a stream of 1000 numbers.
- **Worker**: Given a number, it produces multiple copies of that number.
- **Sink**: The `SinkVec` struct acts as a sink stage in the pipeline. It collects the output from the worker stage and stores the results in a vector.

The implementation of the `InOut<usize, usize>` trait overrides the `run` method to process the input received from the source and prepare the worker for producing multiple copies. The `produce` method generates the specified number of copies of the input. By implementing the `is_producer` method and returning `true`, this stage is marked as a producer. Additionally, the `number_of_replicas` method specifies the number of replicas of this worker to create for parallel processing.

```rust
use ppl::{templates::misc::SinkVec, prelude::*};

// Source
struct Source {
    streamlen: usize,
    counter: usize,
}
impl Out<usize> for Source {
    fn run(&mut self) -> Option<usize> {
        if self.counter < self.streamlen {
            self.counter += 1;
            Some(self.counter)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

// Given an input, it produces 5 copies of it.
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Worker {
    number_of_messages: usize,
    counter: usize,
    input: usize,
}
impl InOut<usize, usize> for Worker {
    fn run(&mut self, input: usize) -> Option<usize> {
        self.counter = 0;
        self.input = input;
        None
    }
    // After calling the run method, the rts of the framework
    // will call the produce method till a None is returned.
    // After a None is returned, the node will fetch the 
    // next input and call the run method again.
    fn produce(&mut self) -> Option<usize> {
        if self.counter < self.number_of_messages {
            self.counter += 1;
            Some(self.input)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
    // We mark this node as a producer
    fn is_producer(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
    fn number_of_replicas(&self) -> usize {
        8
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create the pipeline using the pipeline! macro
    let mut p = pipeline![
        Source {
            streamlen: 1000,
            counter: 0
        },
        Worker {
            number_of_messages: 5,
            counter: 0,
            input: 0
        },
        SinkVec::build()
    ];

    // Start the processing
    p.start();

    // Wait for the processing to finish and collect the results
    let res = p.wait_end().unwrap();
}
```

More complex examples are available in *benches/*, *examples/*, and in *tests/*.

## Configuration

The configuration of Parallelo Parallel Library (PPL) can be customized by setting environment variables. The following environment variables are available:

- **PPL_MAX_CORES**: Specifies the maximum number of CPUs to use. This configuration is only valid when pinning is active.

- **PPL_PINNING**: Enables or disables the CPU pinning. By default, pinning is disabled (`false`). (Equivalent to `OMP_PROC_BIND` in OpenMP).

- **PPL_SCHEDULE**: Specifies the scheduling method used in the pipeline. The available options are:
  - `static`: Static scheduling (Round-robin) (**Default**).
  - `dynamic`: Dynamic scheduling (Work-stealing between replicas of the same stage enabled).

- **PPL_WAIT_POLICY**: If set to `passive`, the threads will try to give up their time to other threads when waiting for a communication or unused. This is particularly useful when we are using SMT and can improve performances. Instead, if is set to `active`, the threads wil do busy waiting. By default, this option is set to `passive`.

- **PPL_THREAD_MAPPING**: Specifies the thread mapping. By default, the threads are mapped in the order in which the CPUs are found. This option is only valid when pinning is active. (Note that this environment variable is kinda similar to the `OMP_PLACES` environment variable in OpenMP). 
  - Example: `PPL_THREAD_MAPPING=0,2,1,3` will map the threads in the following order:
  `0 -> core 0`, `1 -> core 2`, `2 -> core 1`, `3 -> core 3`.

To customize the configuration, set the desired environment variables before running your Rust program that uses PPL. For example, you can set the environment variables in your shell script or use a tool to load them from a file.

Please note that changing these configuration options may have an impact on the performance and behavior of your parallel computations. Experiment with different settings to find the optimal configuration for your specific use case.

## Channel Backend

Parallelo Parallel Library (PPL) provides flexibility in choosing the channel backend used for multi-producer, single-consumer communication in the framework. Depending on your requirements and preferences, you can select the desired channel backend at compile time using feature flags.

The default backend in PPL is **crossbeam**.

Crossbeam provides a highly performant channel implementation that provides efficient and reliable communication differents threads. It is well-suited for a wide range of parallel computing scenarios.

Overall, PPL supports the following backends:

- **crossbeam**: Uses the [Crossbeam](https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam) channel (**Default**).
- **flume**: Uses the [Flume](https://github.com/zesterer/flume) channel.
- **kanal**: Uses the [Kanal](https://github.com/fereidani/kanal) channel.
- **ff**: Uses a channel based on [FastFlow](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/) queues (**Experimental**).

To select a specific channel backend, enable the corresponding feature flag during the build process. For example, to use the flume channel, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
ppl = { git = ""https://github.com/valebes/ppl.git"", default-features = false, features = [""flume""]}
```

### FastFlow Channel
In addition to the others channel backends, PPL also provides an experimental mpsc channel implementation based on FastFlow queues. This backend is available using the `ff` feature flag.
This implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/valebes/ff_buffer) and is substantially based on the [FF Buffer](https://github.com/lucarin91/ff_buffer) by [Luca Rinaldi](https://github.com/lucarin91).

This backend is built around a wrapper for the FastFlow queues that provides a channel-like interface.

In order to use this implementation you must download and install the FastFlow library in the home directory. The library can be downloaded from [here](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/) or as follows:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/fastflow/fastflow.git
```

## Benchmarks
The benchmarks are available in the *benches/* directory. To run the benchmarks, use the following command:

```bash
cargo bench
```

In order to generate the data set for the Image-Processing benchmark, do the following:
```bash
cd benches/benchmarks/img/images
./generate_input.sh
```

### Available Benchmarks
- **Image Processing**: A benchmark that is based on the Image-Processing benchmark found in [RustStreamBench](https://github.com/GMAP/RustStreamBench/). You can find the benchmark source code [here](https://github.com/GMAP/RustStreamBench/tree/main/image-processing).

- **Mandelbrot Set**: A basic parallel implementation of the well-known iterative algorithm to compute the Mandelbrot Set.

### Image-Processing Results
Following are reported the results obtained by running the image-processing benchmark.
Both benchmarks were implemented using the Pipeline interface (`ppl`) and the Threadpool interface (`ppl-tp`).

The utility for CTF hacker competition for launching sploits for all teams
and submitting flags.

## Prepare ##
1. Set FLAG_FORMAT regexp in flag_format.py
2. Set TEAMS in team_list.py
3. Edit submit_flags in start_posting.py for the checking system

## Usage ##
### Starting a sploit ###
    ./start_sploit.py <sploit>

Launches sploit for all teams.
Sploit should take team ip as first arg. Its output should contain flags.
Flags will be saved in **flags/\<sploit\_name\>\_\<team\_name\>.txt**

### Starting the poster ###
    ./start_posting.py

Posts the flags in flags/\*.txt to the checking system.
Saves posted flags in **posted_good_flags.txt** and **posted_bad_flags.txt**.

## Optimizing a sploit ###

If there are >100 teams, don't write a sploit like this:

    hack(ip)
    
Write like this:
    
    while True:
        hack(ip)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        sleep(30)

It is much faster.

Final product aims to have ease of installation and use for non-technical users. ,"# CoopCommand

# Development on this project has stopped. See [CoopCommand ESP32](https://github.com/hms-11/CoopCommandESP32) for the next generation controller and code.

Chickens are simple animals with lots of benefits. The downside? Humans are not the only creatures that find chickens tasty and chickens themselves require some basic maintenance and care to keep happy and healthy. 

CoopCommand aims to reduce the daily labour of looking after chickens, improve their well-being as well as allow hobby-farmers the ability to go out for the night without worrying if their chickens are in danger from wandering predators. 

Contributors always welcome, I could use people smarter than myself to keep improving this project.

[![CoopCommand Picture](https://github.com/hms-11/CoopCommand/blob/main/PXL_20210510_112449138.jpg)](https://github.com)

# GOALS:

- Ease of installation and configuration for non-technical individuals. 

- Multiple Power Options (wall wart mains power or 12-36V off-grid solar/wind/battery systems).

- Configuration settings saved in case of power-outage.

- Wi-Fi connectivity for remote monitoring and overriding of coop door.

- Camera for viewing inside of coop.

# FEATURES:

## COOP COMMAND MAIN BOARD:

- Pluggable Terminal Block connectors for all user-installed inputs/outputs.

- JST XH 5-pin for connection to CoopCam Wi-FI Camera Ad-On.

- DHT22 for interior coop temperature.

- DS18B20 for water temperature.

- GL5539 Photoresistor w/10K resistor voltage divider for daylight sensor.

- MAX3373 level shifting IC for Atmega-ESP32 serial communication.

- 7805 ""footprint"" - Actually uses either one of the drop in footprint compatible buck convertors or my own ""MEGA7805"" buck converter that can output up to 3A cont. 

- TI DRV8871 Motor Driver IC w/3.6A current cabilitity & voltages up to maximimum working voltage of CoopCommand.

- 20x4 LCD.

- I2C backpack integrated.

- 3 user input buttons.

- EEPROM for saving user settings.

- LayLight Relay for supplementing daylight hours to keep chickens laying even with less than 14 hours of Daylight.

- Ventilation Fan Relay for cooling the coop in the summer.

- Water Heat Relay for heating the water in the winter. 

- ATMEGA328P in DIP configuration, easily programmed through Arduino IDE.


## ESP32 COOPCAM:

- ESP32-CAM AI-THINKER based.

- Custom PCB for ESP-32-CAM to socket into, breaks out remaining GPIO's, breaks out serial header for programming and boot button as well as on-board bulk capacity (200UF).

- JST XH 5-pin Connector, identical pinout to mainboard side to allow cable to be plugged in either way.

- Wi-Fi connection through Blynk.

- Serial connection to main board.

## BLYNK:

- Override door open or closed.

- Take a picture with the CoopCam and display it in the app

- Monitor door status (Open, Closed, Opening/Closing).

# Getting Started:

All files are included in this git-repository to get CoopCommand up and running. To get started, use the Gerber files and BOM to get the PCB's coming. The pic n place files can be used if your board house supports assembly. These boards were designed to use JLCPCB's assembly service with as many ""basic"" components as possible. 

Once you have the boards in hand and assembled, see the programming notes file for instructions on how to load the code. ATTENTION: This guide assumes the ATMEGA328P has a bootloader already installed, if working with new, ""bare"" chips you will need to burn a bootloader before installing the sketch. 

For the ESP32-CAM ""CoopCam"" aspect, this guide from Random Nerd Tutorials outlines the steps for setting up a gmail account with the proper settings. https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-send-photos-email/ 
These settings, along with your wifi info and BLYNK authentication token will need to be put into the sketch for the camera. 

# CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES:

- Some Camera ribbon cables seem to be different lengths, some tweaking of CamLid file may be needed to ensure lens fits through housing.  

- The CoopCam and associated Blynk app should not be used at this point. Reboot can cause CoopCommand to go into manual door mode, leaving the door open at night. Main board functions fine running solo. 

# PLANNED UPGRADES:


- Figure out what is up with the multi-button press sometimes required. 

- Improved EEPROM setting saves with more user settings being saved to EEPROM (currently door close light level, water heat on and ventilation fan on temps are saved).

- ""self configuration"" of system on startup. I would like the door to run an initial cycle on first power-on so it can self test motor connections and adjust if connected ""backwards"" 

- Easy deployment of CoopCam. Would like users to log into a self-hosted website on the ESP32-Cam, input their Wifi info and Blynk Authorization certificate. then have the system reboot on their network, attached to their Blynk app.

939,hou_farm,fxnut,N/A,https://github.com/fxnut/hou_farm,https://api.github.com/repos/fxnut/hou_farm,A Deadline farm submission tool.,"# hou_farm
A Deadline farm submission tool. 

![Hou Farm Screenshot](doc/img/Submit.png)

For a short blog post with more screen shots, [click here](https://www.andynicholas.com/post/hou-farm-deadline-submission-tool-for-houdini)

## Features

  * Do away with the cluttered and over-complicated submission dialog. Instead, it places all the submission settings on the ROP nodes. This saves having to remember the settings for each ROP task that you submit to the farm.
  * Hides many of the less common Deadline settings under an Advanced section (hidden by default)
  * Supports the following ROPs (not all fully tested yet, although they should be fine):
    * Mantra ROP
    * Geometry ROP (and SOP version)
    * Alembic ROP
    * IFD Archive ROP
    * Comp ROP
    * Channel ROP
    * BakeTexture ROP
    * OpenGL ROP
    * DOP ROP
  * Respects simple dependency indicated by ROP tree network. Creates jobs on a ROP by ROP basis, and does not split into individual frame dependencies.
  * Allows submission of:
    * Individual nodes
    * Nodes above the submitted ROP node
    * The entire connected ROP tree.
  * Shelf tool patches existing ROP nodes with settings. No custom nodes
  * Deadline interface for the nodes is built on the fly from config file. Easy to reuse parameter layouts and add new nodes.
  * Allows you to split tasks into N chunks, or automatically calculate number of chunks based on number of frames.
  * Performs validation of ROP nodes before submission and reports errors and warnings. For example, it catches common errors such as:
    * Missing camera
    * Disabled IFD export
    * Using default IFD path
    * Missing specified Deadline pool
    * Camera background image enabled
  * Graceful fallback should hou_farm or Deadline not be present on the system. Won't break your scene or generate annoying errors.
  * Allows you to develop/test Hou Farm without Deadline installed by defining HOUFARM_VIRTUAL_DEADLINE in the environment.

## Installation

  1) Open hou_farm_example.env and copy the lines into your own $HOME/houdini/XX.Y/houdini.env file. 
  1) Change the HOUFARM environment variable to point to the location of hou_farm.
  1) Launch Houdini.
  1) Add the hou_farm shelf to your toolbar at the top by clicking on the + button and selecting Shelves->Hou Farm.

## Usage
  1) Now that hou_farm is installed you should be able to select ROPs in the network view and use the hou_farm ""Patch"" shelf tool to add the settings to the ROPs.
  1) Patching a node puts all existing parameters under a top-level folder, and creates a new folder called Deadline where you can find all the submission settings.
  1) When you first do this in a session of Houdini, hou_farm will cache the Deadline pools and groups to save having to re-interrogate the Deadline database everytime you select a new node. If you need to update the lists, then go to the Settings tab and click on ""Refresh Pools/Groups"".
  1) Once you're happy with the settings, just click on the appropriate Submit button to send the scene to the farm.

## Future Work

  * Better usage documentation
  * Provide checkboxes to allow validation tests to be enabled/disabled.
  * Add support for custom validation python code.
  * Support Fetch ROP
  * Add Wedge functionality (possibly through custom ROP rather than existing Wedge ROP)

## Development Notes

  * Only tested on Windows so far. In theory, it should work fine on Linux and OSX, although I'm sure there'll be some fixes required.
  * Mostly written a functional style, and relatively little OOP. This was done mainly because I've been using OOP for a long time and after working on a pure C project, I wanted to experiment with seeing how necessary OOP actually is. Sometimes OOP just gets in the way. May decide at some point to rework some of this into classes to reduce code bloat.
  * Hou_farm was written to potentially expand to support other farm software. It would still need a lot of factorisation for better reuse of much of the Deadline code.

- Since we all have a different graphic settings - you can always just make your own screenshots and replace the default ones in the folder, according, to your resolution (full/qhd).

---

## Requirements:
- [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/ ""https://playvalorant.com/en-us/"")
- [Python v3.7.9*](https://www.python.org/downloads/ ""https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/"") 
(Please use it as the last non-bugfix version)  
[Direct link for Windows 10 installer*](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe)  
*Do not forget to check ""Add Python to PATH""
- [PC](https://downloadmoreram.com/ ""Go on, do it"")
- Screen
- If you are using *Windows 10 Pro **N*** you need to add **Media Feature Pack** by going to  
`Start > Settings > Apps > Apps and features > Optional features > Add a feature`,  
 and then locate Media Feature Pack in the list of available optional features.

## Setup:
0. [**Download latest release**](https://github.com/sogoeslight/ValorantBot/archive/1.44.zip) and unzip it anywhere
1. Make sure you have python installed
2. Execute -> Installer.bat
3. Valorant -> Settings -> General -> Text Language: **English (United States)**
4. Valorant -> Settings -> Video -> Display Mode: **Windowed**;  
Resolution: your native resolution, so game should be on whole screen, but in window  
### Additional:
- If you want script to launch Valorant for you - set `valorant_is_opened` in /scripts/settings.py to `False`,  
but don't forget that it will open in the last used resolution and display mode!
- Also, you can adjust `average_valorant_load_time` 
and `average_match_load_time` (/scripts/settings.py 20 and 21 lines)

## Launch:

943,SmartGreenhouse,obernardovieira,N/A,https://github.com/obernardovieira/SmartGreenhouse,https://api.github.com/repos/obernardovieira/SmartGreenhouse,:leaves: An arduino system for autonomous greenhouse. Only the basic. :four_leaf_clover:,"# SmartGreenhouse

### Description:
A repository with the basic functions to an autonomous greenhouse.
There is no limited number of connected components (e.g. sensors)

### Installation:
There is not specific installation, it just need to be uploaded to arduino. But the data struct need to be configured to make the components work.
**How to configure a new component**
*This is really easy to add, just follow the steps below*
* 1. Increment the number os components
  * Go to file ""datatype.h"" and in ""#define TOTAL_COMPONENTS 3"" change 3 to the number of your components
* 2. Upload the sketch and run it
  * Run the arduino and use the command ""c help"" trough the Serial Monitor
* 3. Give them things to do
  * Go to file ""components.h"" the last function called ""check_components"" and crete your own method to controle one component,
  using the output of another one, or by time. You know what to do. (Don't forget to reupload)


### Usage:
After the installation, everything should be running fine. If any port number and/or type is change, it changes in realtime, with need to restart. But there ar some precaution, read **Notes** below!
**Note** Changes are not automatically updated, the user needs to update using the command *save*. Data is automatically loaded. 
**Note(2)** It's recomended to not disconnect components from one port and connect to another with arduino running. So, update the data, save it, turn of arduino, change ports and start again.
#### In this example
In this example it uses three components, in this case, two leds and one **potentiometer** (the circuit sketch is at the end)
***The first led*** is controlled by time. At the time *X* it turns on, at the time *Y* it turns off
***The second led*** is controlled using the potentiometer's output.
It can be used as a water dropped controller by hour, using an rtc, and a heater and coller controlled by temperature.
This is just an example. See th sketch ![here](https://github.com/obernardovieira/SmartGreenhouse)

### Contributing:
Everyone is free to contribute. Fork the project, make you changes and pull request. If you find bugs open an issue, or you can fix by yourself just forking, make changings and then pull request. It's complitly free project, so you can download and use it on your own.

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.sergkhram/idbclient.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22io.github.sergkhram%22%20AND%20a:%22idbclient%22)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-purple.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

It is the way to get access to the idb programmatically, using kotlin. You can control Apple devices and simulators from 
your code with this client, which creates a connection to them by grpc. All you need to set up is to install the idb companion
(https://fbidb.io/docs/installation) on your Mac and run it. You can use idb client connection from any architecture.

## Functionality
We provide commands' wrappers to functionality of idb companion(you can check the full list here https://fbidb.io/docs/commands)

## How to
1. Import library from maven:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.sergkhram</groupId>
  <artifactId>idbclient</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.5-RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```
2. Create idbClient: 
```
val idb = IOSDebugBridgeClient()
```
3. Connect companion:
```
val udid = idb.connectToCompanion(TcpAddress(""127.0.0.1"", 10882))
```
4. Execute request:
```
val result = idb.execute(
    LogRequest(
        predicate = {false}, 
        timeout = Duration.ofSeconds(10)
    ),
    udid
)
result.forEach(::println)
```

To assist plant lovers & hobby gardeners, as well as greenhouse or garden keepers, Melon Green project is an open-source farm, garden and greenhouse automation controller system (hardware & software), which is aimed to be easy to use, affordable and multipurpose.   


### How does it work?
In summary, Melon Green is a [board](Documentation/1_Melon_Green_Board_[DIY].md) (based on AVR microprocessors) with an [operating software](Documentation/2_Upload_Melon_Green_to_AVR.md), which gets [your orders (settings)](Documentation/3_Serial_Command_Line_Interface.md), detects events in its environment, and toggles agricultural machinery (like irrigation pumps, solenoid valves, heaters, humidifiers, etc.) on or off, whenever it's needed.  
Melon Green Keeps Date & Time, Senses Temperature, Humidity, Soil Moisture, Rain (Detection) & Room/Sun Light Intensity. It can operate irrigation system/facilities, grow light supplier, heater, fan/cooler and humidifier. Melon Green has also some experimental functionalities to mix feeding solution (e.g. diluting concentrated liquid fertilizer).

# dankmemer-farm

Simple script to farm Dankmemer coins with multiple accounts at once.

**Requires:** `Discord Tokens` | `requests` module

## Disclaimer

**SOME COMMANDS NOLONGER WORK. THE SCRIPT IS NOLONGER ABLE TO AUTO-TRANSFER MONEY FROM A ALT ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT! ALL OTHER COMMANDS STILL WORK AND CAN BE FULLY CUSTOMIZED!**

I don't take responsibility if you get banned from a server or if your Tokens get locked

You can run this script with 15 accounts at once before getting rate limited.

**All accounts need access to the channel ID you provide. Make sure all accounts are in the server and have send message permission**

## Usage
This script was build for [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

```
py main.py
```

How to use.
------------
**1.** Create a folder.

**2.** Place the python file in the folder.

**3.** Place a text file (`tokens.txt`) with discord Tokens in the folder.
**Call the file ""tokens.txt""**. If you change the name, the script won't find your Tokens.

**4.** Edit the script and change the following variables. They are indicated with ""CHANGE THIS"".

`channel_id` -> Set this to the ID of the channel you want to farm in.

`id` -> Set this to your user ID. The bots will send their money to this account.

**All your Tokens need access to the channel, so make sure they are joined, and have send message permission.**

**5.** Run the script with `python3 main.py`

**6. Profit**

## Support
Open a github issue

You can join my Disocrd [server](https://daddyissue.org)



## FAQ
> **Do i need multiple accounts?**

No, you can run this with as many accounts as you like. Note that Discord will rate limit you if you send too many API requests.

> **The file closes after i open it**

You have to run the file via the command prompt / terminal. If you don't know how to do that, ask for help in [my discord server](https://daddyissue.org)

> **How do i download Python**

You can download the latest version of [Python3 here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
After downloading, run the file, and make sure you click the checkbox `add to path` as it will help you out later.

> **Can i get banned**

Yes. You can always get banned. Blacklisted by dankmemer or banned by discord. It's very unlikely tho.

> **All the commands are saying they failed**

Make sure your tokens are valid and that all accounts have permission to send messages in the channel you supplied. If you still get errors, open a Github issue
> **How do i get channel id's and user id's**

You can enable developer settings in Discord like this: `settings -> advanced -> developer settings` then right-click a channel or user and click `copy id`

> **How do i get my Discord token**

I can't explain this here, but **google it**

## A command center for Mochimo miners

Mochimo Farm Manager aggregates statistics from your miner in a simple web interface


### What is Mochimo ?

[Mochimo](https://mochimo.org/) is a quantum proof, scalable, ASIC-resistant POW cryptocurrency.
You can download the Mochimo miner from the official [repository](https://github.com/mochimodev/mochimo).


### What is Mochimo Farm Manager ?
The nature of Mochimo blockchain (1 CPU = 1 Vote) requires to setup several miner through virtualization/dockerization in order to fully use the processing power of a multi-core CPU. An alternative solution is to setup multiple low resource host (usually rented through a cloud provider).
Whatever solution you choose, the end result will be multiple independent miners which makes monitoring very tedious.

Mochimo Farm Manager brings all your miner together in a simple web interface (both standard HTML and API). A large panel of monitoring features is available:

- Aggregation of mining statistics (HPS, Block Solved, Height & Difficulty, running processes, etc)
- Remote start/stop capabilities
- Expected Time to Reward calculation (expected time before solving a block given the current HPS of the farm). 
- Customizable network consensus calculation (bx.mochimo.org, miner specific, farm wide)
- Detection of lagging miner and automatic restart
- Detection of stopped miner and automatic start
- Automatic reboot of a miner after specified uptime is reached
- etc...

*Tip*: You don't need to run the full Mochimo Farm Manager to compute Network Estimates and/or the Expected Time to Reward. Use the `estimate` command. 
```
java -jar mochimo-farm-manager-version.jar estimate --height 2423 --diff 38 --hps 200000
Height: 2423.0
Block Reward:   5.483720450999266 MCM
Difficulty:     38.0
Estimated Network HPS:  815,661,444.94
Mining HPS:     200,000.00
Contribution:   0.024519977159798145 %
Estimated Time to Reward:       15 days, 22 Hrs, 20 Minutes, 28 Seconds
```




### How does Mochimo Farm Manager works ?

Mochimo Farm Manager is performing an [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) connection to each miner in the farm on regular intervals. Once the connection is established, it will remotely execute several command to get the status of the miner (CPU load, running processes, etc) and will close the connection. There is no need to run it on the miner's host, your day to day PC will do just fine.


### Download, Install & Configuration

All product and company names are the registered trademarks of their original owners. The use of any trade name or trademark is for identification and reference purposes only and does not imply any association with the trademark holder of their product brand.*

<br/>

##### :exclamation: Use a dedicated user to run and monitor your miner. Avoid naming it 'mochimo'. Do not use `root`.

<br/>

##### Part 1 - Configure the miner

1. Edit **start.sh** and set the path to the bin folder of the miner (ex: `/home/mysuer/mochi/bin`)
2. Upload **start.sh** to your miner's host. Even though the location does not matter, I recommend the bin folder
3. Give executing permission to **start.sh** `chmod +x start.sh`
4. Run `./start.sh` on the miner's host. This command will create a file name `miner.log` that contains the output of the running miner. You will not be able to interact with the miner at this point but you can still monitor it by reading the content of `miner.log`. Use the command `tail -f -n100 miner.log` to read the log (it will update automatically when a new line is written)


##### Part 2 - Configure Mochimo Farm Manager

1. Install [Java](https://java.com/en/download/) (version 8 or higher)
2. Download the latest release of Mochimo Farm Manger [here](https://github.com/0rtis/mochimo-farm-manager/releases). *Note*: the executable `jar` `mochimo-farm-manager-version.jar` is only available in the release package. If you clone the repository, you will need to build the `jar` yourself with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
3. Create a farm configuration file based on the example `example_mining_farm.json`:
	* `networkConsensus`: specify the method to compute the network consensus
		1. `bx.mochimo.org`: uses https://bx.mochimo.org/ (this is the default method)
		2. `farm`: average statistics from each miner
		3. `miner MINER_ID`: use statistics from miner MINER_ID
	* `id`: unique ID of the miner
	* `host`: ip and port for ssh connection. example: `192.168.1.2:22`
	* `user`: username for SSH connection
	* `password` or `privateKeyPath`: SSH authentication can be made with password or a path to private key
	* `startCommand`: start command of the miner. Set the path to **start.sh** that you uploaded to the host in Part 1 
	* `stopCommand`: stop command of the miner. If not specified, a `kill` command is send
	* `logCommand`: command to retrieve miner's log. Edit the existing command by replacing `/home/myuser/mochi/bin/miner.log` by the path to **miner.log** (there is two instance to replace)
	* `policy`: policy can be set for automatically restart the miner on specific events. A `policy` is composed of triggers:
		1. `maxLag LAG`: reboot the miner if the difference between its height and the network consensus height is greater or equal to LAG
		2. `maxDowntime AMOUNT`: start the miner if it has been down more than AMOUNT of time. AMOUNT can be seconds, minutes or hours (ex: `30s`, `5M`, `3H`)
		3. `maxUptime AMOUNT`: reboot the miner after AMOUNT of time
		
        
        Triggers can be combined to create a policy. For example -> `""policy"":""maxLag 3, maxDowntime 1H, maxUptime 12H""`:
        - Reboot if the height difference reaches 3
        - Start if downtime reaches 1 hour
        - Reboot if the uptime reaches 12 hours
        
    	Check the formatting of your config file in a [JSON validator](https://jsonlint.com/) (Remove sensitive information before doing so). A badly formatted config file will generate an error when starting the farm manager (`com.google.gson.JsonSyntaxException`)
    
4. *Higly Recommended*: encrypt your configuration file `java -jar mochimo-farm-manager-version.jar encrypt plain_text_config.json encrypted_config.json`
5. Start the farm manager `java -jar [path to the mochimo farm manager jar] start [path to your config file] [path to the html folder]` <br/> For example `java -jar ""C:/Users/ortis/Downloads/mochimo-farm-manager-0.5/mochimo-farm-manager-0.5.jar"" start ""C:/Users/ortis/Downloads/mochimo-farm-manager-0.5/my_farm.json"" ""C:/Users/ortis/Downloads/mochimo-farm-manager-0.5/html""`
6. Access the dashboard http://localhost:8888

There are several start option available. Make sure to check them out `java -jar mochimo-farm-manager-version.jar start -h`

Mochimo Farm Manager also provides a REST API:
* http://localhost:8888/status : farm statistics
* http://localhost:8888/miner?id=minerId : miner statistics
* http://localhost:8888/command?id=minerId&cmd=commandToExecute : execute remote command `cmd=start`, `cmd=stop`, `cmd=restart`

A bot written in Python using image processing to auto-farm Metin stones. The bot may not be suitable for slow computers as it needs CPU power to process images and detect objects in it. Otherwise it will be painfully slow or may not even work properly.

## How it works
- Logins to your character.
- Teleports to the correct map.
- Rotates the camera looks for a Metin stone.
- Breaks the stone and collect items.
- Checks if the player is killed, stuck, or kicked.

### Notes
- Rubinum seems to have prevented such scripts from sending input to the client. So currently it seems the bot doesn't work anymore.
- The bot may not work for every server especially in its current version. It was created for Rubinum. The client must give you the ability to save your login credentials, your player must have a ring that teleports you to the place you want to farm and a map that is made specifically for stone-breaking. The bot isn't advanced enough to run around searching.
- Configuration for this bot is a bit complex so it may be difficult to understand.
- Recommended game resolution: 1024x768. 800x600 makes the UI elements overlap each other and causes problems on detection. And larger resolutions will increase the time of image processing.
- Your character should have a horse and ride it for the bot to work properly.
- The bot can handle multiple clients at the same time.
- The bot uses libraries that only work on Windows.
- The bot is still not finished. However, it may or may not be continued. There are many configurations that are hardcoded and the modularity is poor.

## Configuration
First of all, I need to explain the config files. In order to configure the bot properly, you need to understand how exactly it works.

We have 3 directories: clients, maps and relatives.

### relatives
Note: The current version doesn't support multiple resolutions as they are hardcoded. So you can skip the current guide if you want unless you are going to change the code yourself.

This file contains some screen coordinates for specific resolutions. If you want to use one of the two that are already there you can leave the file as it is. This configuration basically creates an example of a hypothetical client that is going to be used to calculate the relative position on your screen.

For example: If our hypothetical client's top left position was in (895, 270) position, where would the mini-map be? Let's say it's on (1903, 286) Where would the the stone hp be? Let's say it's on (1408, 293). So if your actual top left position is on (862, 315) the program can guess where the these positions are by finding the relation of them. This is done by the following code:

### bmath.py

    def get_relative(top_left, new_top_left, def_pos):
        dif = (def_pos[0] - top_left[0], def_pos[1] - top_left[1])

        pos = (new_top_left[0] + dif[0], new_top_left[1] + dif[1])

        return pos
        
- `top_left` is the config's file top left position of the client. It is used to find all relative positions.  
- `new_top_left` is the top left position of your actual client.  
- `def_pos` is the configs position we want to find the relative one.  
- `[0]` is the x position on screen and `[1]` is y. So by writing `new_top_left[0]` we mean the x value of your client's top left position.

So, to find the position of the mini-map, we have:

    top_left = (895, 270)  
    new_top_left = (862, 315)  
    def_position = (1903, 286)

Replacing the values:

    dif = (1903 - 895, 286 - 270) = (1008, 16)
    pos = (862 + 1008, 315 + 16) = (1870, 331)

So in this example, the mini-map's position would be at (1870, 331). This applies to all positions that are included in this configuration file.


### Create your own config of relatives

Now that we know how it works, let's see how to create our own config file for other resolutions.

First of all, you need to take a couple of screenshots. One of your login screen, one of your game screen while having a mob or a stone as a target so the health bar at the top is visible and one while being dead. You also need an image editor or any other software that you can find cordinates by pointing your cursor in the image. [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/index.html) is good enough and also free. Now let's explain some things:

- `top-left` is of course your screen's top left position. Not the window but the very top left pixel of your game screen. It is recommended to get it right so it doesn't cause miscalculations.
- `window-size` is your client's window size. Basically the game resolution however, the height should be the without including the bottom bar. Give it some extra 50-100 pixels offset as well because you won't need that part of your screen the image process. See the already existing values to get an idea.
- `stone-bar-close` is the x button on the health bar. This is basically the main issue with the 800x600 resolution as it may overlap with the event buttons next to it.
- `mini-map` is the button that closes the minimap at the top right of your screen.

For the stone hp the bot creates a rectangle around the hp value and detects the text inside it. So in order to take the value we need a top left position and the rectangle size:
- `hp` is the top left position.
- `hp-rectangle` is the rectangle size. This may not be necessary to change it.

The same method applies here. The bot detects if the player died by trying to find the revive here button.
- `revive-here` is the top left position of the revive button.
- `revive-rectangle` is the rectangle size.

- `account1-12` is the saved accounts on the login screen. If the client doesn't support saved accounts you may put some safe value that will not affect anything on click. The bot, by the way, will get stuck.
- `channel1-8` is for channel selection. Add whateer values if the channels are less. Add the emptier channels if the channels are more.

The following ones are for Rubinum2 only. They are used on map configuration to set the navigation of that specific map through the menu. If you can make it work somehow on other servers, good.
- `next` is the next page option.
- `ork` and `red-forest` are map names. Self explanatory.
- `area1-8` are specific areas on each map.

### maps
This file contains map settings. This file is much simpler.

- `name` is the name of the map. This is used to set which map a specific client will go to search for stones. See clients.
- `stone-sample` contains the directory of stone pictures which will be used to detect the Metin stone you want to search for. You can add to that directory as many samples as you want. In the current version, you have to screenshot the name of the stone and not the texture. If you want to detect the texture, make sure to get only small samples for more accuracy. Look the content of the `icons` folder to get the idea. Furthermore, make sure to change the code accordingly: open `actions.py` and find the function `select_target`. There's a line `loc = (loc[0], loc[1] + 80)`. 80 is the offset of the click downwards. If you're using the name as the target keep it as it is or change it to a different offset if 80 doesn't work on you. Put 0 if you are using textures as samples. Note: The sub-folders that exist in the folder are not being used. You can use them to store more samples while not using them. At the current version, you cannot use the name in one case and texture in another.
- `object-detection` currently doesn't work. However, it would be used to change the object detection method in case one doesn't work. This is a bit of an advanced option so keep it as it.
- `hl` basically means high-low. Some object detection methods give high values to best matches and some the opposite. So this says the bot which of these cases to look for. Advanced option.
- `threshold` is a threshold that helps the bot determine if the best match of the detection is actually the object being searched. Again, advanced option. Leave it as it is.

- `navigation` is the clicks you have to do to navigate to the specific map. You can add as many as you want and also name them whatever you want. It doesn't matter.

### clients
This is the config files for the clients you want to use. Each file is used for a different client.

- `account` includes some settings for each account. If enabled is fales the bot ignores this client. Id is the client's position on the saved logins. channel is the channel you want to login. username is only used in the console to let you know which client is being used at the moment. map is the map you want to go.
- `position` is used to tell the bot where your player is being placed in character selection. Currently doesn't work so make sure it's at the front.
- `navigation` has some settings to help your bot navigate through your client. task-bar is the position of the client's window on the Windows task bar. Make sure to not combine the same windows into one in the task bar settings. top-left is your clients top left position. Use the guide at the relatives to see how to get it (Create your own config of relatives). ring is the position of the map menu at the bottom bar. Supported values (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`).
- `skills` is the same as ring but for skills. Add the skills like Aura of Sword or buffs or whatever that you need to have your character prepared. Add as many as you want. Also, the name doesn't matter. It's just an identifier.
- `horse-skills` is, of course, for horse skills. Currently only slash is supported that is used to unstuck your character if they're being surrounded.

## Run

### Requirements
- You need to install Python 3.7 or newer.
- Open cmd and using `pip`, install the following libraries:
 
    - pillow
    - cv2
    - opencv-python
    - pyautogui
    - numpy
    - keyboard
    - imutils
    - pytesseract

### Start the bot
Before you run, make sure you you have opened the clients you want to use in their login screens. Run the bot by typing `python main.py`. After that, don't touch your keyboard and don't click anywhere. Do it only if you want to stop the bot. To do so, quickly open the cmd window and press `Ctrl` + `C`.

The bot will run for 5000 times in total. That means each time it catches a player farming, it counts +1. In `main.py` change the `max_loops` value if you want to change the value or replace the `while loop < max_loops:` line with `while True:` to run the program infinitely.

There are also two extra scripts:
- `cords.py` which you can use to click anywhere on your screen and get the coordinates. It uses only the `pyautogui` library.
- `xp.py` is a very simple bot that automates xp farming by automatically pressing `space` and every 10 seconds `2` to activate a cape. I uses only the `keyboard` library. You can change the button if you want inside the code:
    - `binput.press_button('2')` is to press the cape. Supported values (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `f1`, `f2`, `f3`, `f4`).
    - `sleep(10)` is the frequency for each cape in seconds.
    - `task_bar = (1291, 1062)` is the position of your client in the task bar. It is used for the bot to bring the window at the top.

Question answering (QA) is a computer science discipline within the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing (NLP), which is concerned with building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language. 

![Alt text](output/qa.png?raw=true ""Question answering"")

There are two domains in question answering.  
1 - Open domain question answering  (ODQA)  
2 - Closed domain question answering (CDQA)  

## Open domain question answering  (ODQA)
The ability to answer factoid questions is a key feature of any dialogue system. Formally speaking, to give an answer based on the document collection covering wide range of topics is called open-domain question answering (ODQA). The ODQA task combines the challenges of document retrieval (finding the relevant articles) with that of machine comprehension of text (identifying the answer span from those articles). An ODQA system can be used in many applications. Chatbots apply ODQA to answer user requests, while the business-oriented Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions leverage ODQA to answer questions based on internal corporate documentation. The picture below shows a typical dialogue with an ODQA system.

![Alt text](output/odqa.png?raw=true ""Open domain question answering"")

## Closed domain question answering (CDQA)
When no restriction is made on the domain of the questions we are talking about open domain question answering. Instead, when questions are bound to a specific domain we are talking about closed (or restricted) domain question answering (CDQA). Here we are providing a paragraph or a document with a question. The CDQA system will extract the answer to the question by analysing the given paragraph or document;

![Alt text](output/cdqa.png?raw=true ""Closed domain question answering"")

Here I am explaining different approaches for both open domain question answering and closed domain question answering.

# Dead by Daylight XP/Rift Farm

In DBD you get 1 XP per second capped at 10 minutes, so this script will get you around 4950 XP (500 XP = 1 Rift Fragment) per hour (during my tests).

Remember that you can get banned even thought I haven't heard about AFK bans.

## Warnings

**[!] This script may not work with your monitor! You can open `screenshot.png` file and change values at line 39.**

**[!] You can't use your pc while using this script! The game has to be focused.**

## Features

- Auto queue

## Roadmap

- Statistics

- Text recognition area selector.

## Installation

- If you don't know what git is you can [click here to download the zip](https://github.com/Pazdikan/dbd-xp-farm/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unpack it.

## Usage
- Run the game, select the killer and stay on the screen with ready button.
- Run the `start.bat` file.

You can bring perks like [Corrupt Intervention](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Corrupt_Intervention) and [Hex: Ruin](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Hex:_Ruin) to slow down the game (for full 10 minutes XP)

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->
## Configuration

This is a list of configurable options in the `config.json` file and what they mean.

| Configurable             | Description                                                                                                                                                                  | Default | Datatype |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|
| `lastProcessedArticleID` | Saves the last processed article ID to prevent repeated processing. Do not modify this unless you know what you are doing.                                                   | 14      | int      |
| `articlesPerSession`     | Number of articles the script will process every time you run it. Once it processes that many articles, it will stop and exit.                                               | 100     | int      |
| `threads`                | Number of threads to run. More threads means that the script will be able to solve more articles concurrently, but will also use more system resources.                      | 4       | int      | 
| `headless`               | If set to true, the browser will be invisible which increases performance. It is recommended to turn this on for quicker solving, especially when multiple threads are used. | false   | bool     |

Client software for 3d printers interfacing with AutoDrop3D. This software will let you connect your printer to the https://autodrop3d.com cloud.


This is the client software for the autodrop3d printer system.
This software automatically retrieves gcode print jobs from the autodrop3d server and sends the gcode via serial to the printer connected to the raspberry pi.

There are additional features to make automatic part ejection possible by toggling the GPIO pins of the raspberry pi using wiringpi. It is also capable of using filament run out detectors with out any modifications to printer firmware.


![Image description](hookup.png)

#Instructions 
1) Hook up push buttons, LEDs and other items to GPIO header on the raspberry pi. 
    pin numbers are using the board pin header numbers for the raspberry pi
    

    A minimal setup dose not require all pins listed to be used. 

    | Required | Type   | Function        | pin # |

    |          |        |                 |       |
    

    
2) Download prebuilt raspberry pi image image from the following link
https://github.com/Autodrop3d/autodrop3dClient/releases/download/latest/autodrop3dimage-20201128.zip

3) Extract the ZIP file and use etcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or similar softwar to write the image file to a 16gb sd card.

4) Boot the raspberry pi with the SD card.

5) Once booted press the config button. This will switch the raspberry pi in to wifi config mode and make the pi broadcast out a wifi access point.

6) Connect to the wifi network ""autodrop3dConfig"" with the password of ""autodrop3d"". Once connected goto http://192.168.4.1:8080

7) On the configuration page enter your wifi network credentials and save the configuration. Pres the config button connected to the pi to switch it back in to wifi station mode and connect to your local wifi.

# Components:

> These are some of the important components in this app!

- **Image Gallery**
   - Very common gallery system needed in all apps.
- **Angular Animations**
  
<br>


## Image Gallery

The out of box and responsive image gallery made by modifing angular2-image-gallery.


To change the images in **[assets/img/gallery](https://github.com/JunkieLabs/treeform-angular-webapp/tree/master/src/assets/img/gallery)**.
Follow these steps.

- Install [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) in your system. 
- Add Images in any folder except gallery inside assets/img  folder.
- Craete command in pacakge.json file. For example

```json
    ""convert:newImages"": ""node ./image-convert.js --gName=newImages ./src/assets/img/newImages"",

```
- In above command newImages is a new folder. And [image-convert.js](https://github.com/JunkieLabs/treeform-angular-webapp/blob/master/image-convert.js) file is the script. After conversion one new folder will be there in assets/img/gallery.

<br>

## SCSS: Styling


> No CSS in any style related file ! The design is fully design using scss structure.



All the basic and common scss class has a prefix selector *tb-* to distinguish it from other angular material related classes. you can find the styles in [theme/tb](https://github.com/JunkieLabs/treeform-angular-webapp/tree/master/src/theme/tb)

<br>



<br>


# FAQ:

### Does this project require bootstrap?



>  No! There isn't a requirement of this library. The design is implemented only using angular material and SCSS styles.

This project is copied from [sashimiswap](https://github.com/SashimiProject/sashimiswap) and modified to work with
non-mintable tokens.

# Quickstart

## Installation

```
npm install
```

## Run tests

```
npm test
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file with keys

```
MNEMONIC=""...""
INFURA_ID=""...""
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""...""
```

* Deployment to rinkeby is done via [Infura](https://infura.io/).
* Create an [Etherscan API key](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) for contract verification.

_Forks of this project should also modify `config.json`. Decimals aren't considered in the configuration._

## Deployment

### Ganache

[Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) is a personal Ethereum blockchain for development and
tests.

```
truffle migrate -- --network development
```

### Rinkeby

To deploy on the [Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.io/) Ethereum testnet, make sure your wallet has enough ETH to pay for the
GAS.

[Faucet 1](https://testnet.help/en/ethfaucet/rinkeby) | [Faucet 2](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

```
truffle migrate -- --network rinkeby
truffle run verify -- --network rinkeby
```

You may also want to verify the ERC20Mock and LPMock contracts on Etherscan.

```
node_modules/.bin/truffle verify ERC20Mock
node_modules/.bin/truffle verify LPMock
```

_Verification may fail because of rate limits. Just try again._

### Ethereum mainnet

```
truffle migrate -- --network mainnet
truffle run verify -- --network mainnet
```

The account that is used to create the Farm contract should have a sufficient amount of (LTO) ERC20 to fund the
contract. Alternatively; to manually fund, remove the 'fund' property from the configuration.

# How it works

The `Farm` contract will distribute ERC20 tokens to participants relative to the number of LP tokens deposited to the
contract. These ERC20 tokens aren't minted. Instead, the contract needs to be funded.

## Creation

The address of the ERC20 token, the reward per block, and the starting block are specified in the constructor of the
`Farm` contract.

## Fund

The contract needs to be funded before the start block. 

To fund the contract, the `Farm` must be allowed to withdraw the amount of ERC20 using the `approve` method of the ERC20
contract.

Call the `fund` method with the appropriate amount The end block is calculated as

    endBlock = startBlock + (funds / rewardPerBlock)

It's possible to add funds with the farm is running and increase the end block.
 
If the end block is reached, the farm is closed and it will no longer be possible to add funds.   

## Adding liquidity pairs

Tokens are distributes amount users that has deposited specific LP tokens. These LP tokens are distributed by the
Uniswap contract for providing liqidity. _Other LP tokens could be used as well._

Each LP token has a specific contract address which can be found on the [Uniswap exchange](https://info.uniswap.org/).

Use the `add` method to add a liquidity pair for which the farm will pay out a reward.

It's possible to add liquidity pairs at a later time. The reward is shared over all pairs.

### AllocPoint

The `add` method takes an `allocPoint` parameter. When adding multiple pairs, this decides the portion of the reward
shared for that LP token.

**Example:** the farm is configured for 3 pairs with an `allocPoint` of resp 6, 12, 18. The
total alloc points is 36. 1/6th of the tokens is distributed under participants that deposited the pair with 6
alloc points: (`6 / 36 = 1/6`). 

It's possible to change the alloc points at a later time via the `update` method.

## Deposit and withdraw

To participate in farming, users must deposit LP tokens using the `deposit` method.

Before using this method, the farm must be allowed to withdraw the LP tokens. This is done via the `approve` method on
the LP token contract.

The current deposit can be check using the `deposited` method. 

Participants can withdraw their LP tokens at any time using the `withdraw` method.

## Reward

Each participant has a pending reward which is hold by the farm. The pending reward can be checked using the `pending`
method.

Any change to the deposit of the participant (with `deposit` or `withdraw`), will pay out the pending reward. It's
possible to do a zero withdraw to just receive the pending reward.

# Better ad farmer for AI Dungeon
A new, better & safer advertisement farmer & bypass for AI Dungeon.

Yes, I am [u/Forever1April](https://www.reddit.com/user/Forever1April) and I still advertise this. I think I did a good job anyway.

## Important
There are no ads in AI Dungeon anymore. It's a win, guys.

AIDBF v2.4x is the last version of AIDBF. Development stopped because it's already perfect and who cares anyway?

[AI Dungeon Farmer](https://github.com/Alluseri/ai-dungeon-farmer) still works, so if AIDBF breaks, use that instead. You remember how, right?

[We couldn't get it banned in 24 hours :(](https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/ygjppv/can_we_get_this_acc_banned_in_under_24_hours/)

## Usage
Android users will need to use dorynode or termux.

For browser users:
1. Install TamperMonkey(GreaseMonkey NOT TESTED!).
2. Copy the contents of either provided `.js` file(`ai-dungeon-better-farmer.min.js` recommended) into clipboard.
3. Create a new TamperMonkey script and paste the copied contents into the script content(overwrite everything!).
4. Ctrl+S.
5. Enable it if required.
6. Open any adventure play of yours and, if you don't see the additional buttons on your hotbar, refresh the page.
7. Click `+10 ACTIONS` or `+10 ACTIONS [FAST]`(fast mode might get the counter out of sync).
8. Your updated actions will be visible at the top right.
9. To use the newly acquired actions, you'll have to refresh the page again.
10. Enjoy!

### Dorynode commands
1. `cd /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/io.tempage.dorynode/files`
2. `cd aidbf`
3. `npm test`/`node .`

---

## Interfaces

You can customise the products, producers and sellers within the farm library. In order to do so, you will need to conform to the following types and interfaces:

### Producers

```JavaScript
[
  {
    name: 'bakery',
    cost: 1000,
    multiplier: 1.05,
    produces: {
      name: 'cookie`
      rate: 0.1
    }
  }
]
```

**Keys:**

- `name` | `{string}` - The name of the producer.
- `cost` | `{number}` - The cost of the producer without decimal places. $1 is stored as `100`, in this example the bakery would cost $10.
- `multiplier` | `{number}` - The compound cost multiplier of the producer, as you buy more of the producer the cost exponentially increases. Set to `1` for no increase.
- `produces` | `{object}` - Object of Produce:
  - `name` | `{string}` - The product name it produces, this must match exactly to an associated product's name.
  - `rate` | `{number}` - The amount it produces per tick. This number can be a decimal. 0.1 would mean it adds 0.1 cookies to the inventory per tick.

### Products

```JavaScript
[
  {
    name: 'cookie',
    value: 100
  }
]
```

**Keys:**

- `name` | `{string}` - The name of the product
- `value` | `{number}` - The value of the product without decimal places. $1 is stored as `100`, in this example the cookie's would be $1.

### Sellers

```JavaScript
[
  {
    name: 'stall',
    cost: 1000,
    multiplier: 1.05,
    products: {
      name: 'cookie`
      rate: 1
    }
  }
]
```

**Keys:**

- `name` | `{string}` - The name of the seller.
- `cost` | `{number}` - The cost of the seller without decimal places. $1 is stored as `100`, in this example the store would cost $10.
- `multiplier` | `{number}` - The compound cost multiplier of the seller, as you buy more of the seller the cost exponentially increases. Set to `1` for no increase.
- `products` | `{object}` - Object of produce:
  - `name` | `{string}` - The product name it sells, this must match exactly to an associated product's name.
  - `rate` | `{number}` - The amount it sells per tick. This number has to be a whole number (no decimals).

## 🎨 Customising the farm

The farm class can take in a custom set of Producers, Products and Sellers. These custom sets must conform to the shape/interface detailed:

- [Producers](#producers): Things that produce products
- [Products](#products): The products being produces
- [Sellers](#sellers): The things that sell the products

You can be quite creative in the theme you choose. It does not just have to be about farms, it can literally be anything!

An example of a customised ""farm"":

```JavaScript
import FarmLib from '@aaronvanston/farm-lib'

const customProducers = [{
  name: 'gold mind',
  cost: 10000,
  multiplier: 1.10,
  produces: {
    name: 'gold_ore',
    rate: 0.1,
  },
}]

const customProducts = [{
  name: 'gold_ore',
  value: 100,
}]

const customSellers = [{
  name: 'smelter',
  cost: 10000,
  multiplier: 1.02,
  products: {
    name: 'gold_ore',
    rate: 1,
  }
}]

const logger = (farmInfo) => console.log(farmInfo)

const farm = new FarmLib({
  producers: customProducers,
  products: customProducts,
  sellers: customSellers,
  handleTick: logger
})
```

### Extending default lists

In addition to creating your own you can extend the current default set to include you own. To access the default lists, you can import them from the `farm-lib` as named imports.

```JavaScript
import FarmLib, { producers, products, sellers } from '@aaronvanston/farm-lib'

// extend, change, remove etc
const customProducers = {
  ...producers,
  // NEW PRODUCER
}

const farm = new FarmLib({
  producers: customProducers,
})
```

# Workestrator

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Yaty/workestrator.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Workestrator is a library to distribute tasks to child processes. It is written in TypeScript and use ES2017 features.
This project is highly inspired by [`node-worker-farm`](https://github.com/rvagg/node-worker-farm) and add some new features.
Typescript Documentation : [https://yaty.github.io/workestrator/](https://yaty.github.io/workestrator/)

`npm install --save workestrator`

## Features

1. Concurrency options
2. Durability / Resilience : when a call fails it will be re-queued automatically (according to the farm options).
3. Async/Await support out of the box
4. Events
5. Serializers : You can choose among several serializers according to the data types you send to the workers. You can also write your own :)
6. Broadcasting

## Usage

```js
const workestrator = require(""workestrator"");

const farm = workestrator.create({
    module: ""/absolute/path/to/the/worker/module.js"",
});

try {
    await farm.run(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
    await farm.runMethod(""foo"", 1, 2, 3); // returns ""bar:1:2:3""
} catch (err) {
    console.log(""Oh ... it failed :("", err);
}
```

And the module is :

```js
module.exports = function(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
};

module.exports.foo = function(a, b, c) {
    return `bar:${a}:${b}:${c}`;
};
```

## API

### Workestrator

#### workestrator.create(options)

Create a new farm.

```js
const workestrator = require(""workestrator"");

const farm = workestrator.create({
    module: ""/absolute/path/to/the/worker/module.js""
});
```

##### `options`

Options is an object, the default values are :

```
{
    fork: {
        args: process.argv,
        cwd: process.cwd(),
        env: process.env,
        execArgv: process.execArgv.filter((v) => !(/^--(debug|inspect)/).test(v)), // without debug and inspect
        execPath: process.execPath,
        silent: false,
    },
    killTimeout: 500,
    maxConcurrentCalls: Infinity,
    maxConcurrentCallsPerWorker: 10,
    maxIdleTime: Infinity,
    maxRetries: 3,
    numberOfWorkers: require(""os"").cpus().length,
    serializerPath: workestrator.serializers.JSON
    timeout: Infinity,
    ttl: Infinity,
}
```

- **`module`** (*mandatory !*) : Absolute path to your module.
- **`fork`** : Fork options used for each worker ([see Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options))
- **`killTimeout`** : The amount of time in ms for a worker to exit gracefully before killing it like butchers with SIGKILL.
- **`maxConcurrentCalls`** : The maximum number of calls in the farm queue, i.e. : calls being processed by workers + calls waiting in the queue.
- **`maxConcurrentCallsPerWorker`** : The maximum number of calls a worker can execute concurrently.
- **`maxIdleTime`** : The maximum amount of time a worker can live without receiving a call. It will kill the worker and restart another one according to your policy.
- **`maxRetries`** : How many times a call should be retried before failing once and for all, it will throw a CallMaxRetryError with the original error in the `reason` property if this is reached.
- **`numberOfWorkers`** : The amount of workers in the farm.
- **`serializerPath`** : Absolute path to the serializer, Workestrator provides two serializers (JSON for basic data types, CBOR for complex data types). [See `Serializers` section.](#serializers)
- **`timeout`** : A call will have to finish under `timeout` ms. It will throw a TimeoutError. It will be retried according to the farm options.
- **`ttl`** : The amount of calls a worker can execute. The worker will be killed, his tasks will be redistributed to other workers. A new worker will be created.

#### workestrator.kill()

Kill all farms.

```js
workestrator.kill();
```

### Farm

#### farm.run(...args)

Run the default exported method in your module with arguments. Async.
Returns what's returned by the default method.

```js
try {
    const res = await farm.run(1, [], """");
    console.log(""Result :"", res);
} catch (err) {
    console.log(""Oh no :'("", err);
}
```

#### farm.runMethod(method, ...args)

Run a specific method in your module. Async.
Returns what's returned by the method.

```js
try {
    // bar is a method exported with : module.exports.bar = function ...
    const res = await farm.runMethod(""bar"", 1, [], """");
    console.log(""Result :"", res);
} catch (err) {
    console.log(""Oh no :'("", err);
}
```

#### farm.broadcast(...args)

Run the default exported method in every worker with arguments. Async.
Returns an array with the first element being the succeeded calls and the second element the failures.

```js
const [successes, failures] = await farm.broadcast(1, [], """");
console.log(""Successes :"", successes);
console.log(""Failures :"", failures);
```

#### farm.broadcastMethod(method, ...args)

Run a specific method in every worker. Async.
Returns an array with the first element being the succeeded calls and the second element the failures.

```js
// bar is a function exported with : module.exports.bar = function ...
const [successes, failures] = await farm.broadcastMethod(""foo"", 1, [], """");
console.log(""Successes :"", successes);
console.log(""Failures :"", failures);
```

#### farm.kill()

Kill the farm.

```js
farm.kill();
```

## Serializers

According to the data you send and receive to your workers you might need to use a different serializer.
Data needs to be serialized in order to be sent to the worker process.

Two serializers are available :
1. JSON (default, Node.js internal serializer), supported types :
    - boolean
    - number (without -0, NaN, and ±Infinity)
    - string
    - Array
    - Object
2. [CBOR](https://github.com/hildjj/node-cbor), supported types :
    - boolean
    - number (including -0, NaN, and ±Infinity)
    - string
    - Array, Set (encoded as Array)
    - Object (including null), Map
    - undefined
    - Buffer
    - Date,
    - RegExp
    - url.URL (Legacy URL API)
    - [bignumber](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js)

For performances you might want to check [the benchmark](./benchmarks/serialization).

You can also build your own serializer. You need to extends the Serializer class :

```js
 const {Serializer} = require(""workestrator"");

class MySerializer extends Serializer {
    encode(data) {
        // do some encoding
        return encodedData;
    }

    decode(data) {
        // do some decoding
        return decodedData;
    }
}

module.exports = MySerializer;
```

Then set the farm options accordingly :

```js
const farm = workestrator.create({
    module: ""/absolute/path/to/the/worker/module.js"",
    serializerPath: ""/absolute/path/to/MySerializer"", // you can use require.resolve to get the absolute path
});
```

JSON serializer path is in `workestrator.serializers.JSON`.

CBOR serializer path is in `workestrator.serializers.CBOR`.

## Events

You can listen to events from a worker of from the farm directly. They both extends Node.js EventEmitter.
All those events are already being used by Workestrator. You do not have to implement anything, it works out of the box.
I wanted to expose events to have the possibility to add logging but I'm sure they are other use-cases :)

### Farm

```js
farm.on(event, callback)
```

#### online

When a new worker is created within the farm.

```js
farm.on(""online"", (worker) => {
    // ...
});
```

#### message

When a worker is sending a message to the farm.

`data` looks like this :

```
{
    callId: number;
    res?: any;
    err?: Error;
    workerId: number;
}
```

```js
farm.on(""message"", (worker, data) => {
    // ...
});
```

#### disconnect

When a worker disconnect.
See [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_disconnect)

```js
farm.on(""disconnect"", (worker) => {
    // ...
});
```

#### error

The `error` event is emitted whenever:
- The process could not be spawned, or
- The process could not be killed, or
- Sending a message to the child process failed.

See [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_error)

```js
farm.on(""error"", (worker, err) => {
    // ...
});
```

#### close

When a stdio streams of a worker have been closed.
See [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_close)

```js
farm.on(""close"", (worker, code, signal) => {
    // ...
});
```

#### exit

See [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/child_process.html#child_process_event_exit)

```js
farm.on(""exit"", (worker, code, signal) => {
    // ...
});
```

#### ttl

When `ttl` is reached.

```js
farm.on(""ttl"", (worker) => {
    // ...
});
```

#### idle

When `maxIdleTime` is reached.

```js
farm.on(""idle"", (worker) => {
    // ...
});
```

## Logging

You can enable logging by using an environment variable : `DEBUG=workestrator:*`

## Why I created this ?

I was looking for a project to use TypeScript, so the idea was to reproduce `node-worker-farm` and add some new features. It actually went pretty smoothly and I'm happy with the result ;)

Raspberry Pi + Nerves based AirAtomized.Farm controller prototype

Currently I use it in a air atomized aeroponic system prototype to control misting schedule. More to come (I hope so).
It works but is very far from any release-kind state.

The following description is very rough, sketchy and probably will be outdated soon enough.

## Modules

- Firmware: Nerves-specific part to allow the main component run on the Raspberry Pi device (RPi3 in my case)
- Peasant: the main part with the core component and the Phoenix LiveView-based UI

## Conceptions
It was intended to be a temporary solution until I made the bigger complex out of the cloud management system and a number of thin IoT controllers just to test an air-atomized aeroponics hardware with real plants. But it might be useful in its current (single fat IoT controller) form.

As I have never worked with such devices before I'm just trying to find better and convenient ways to make it functional therefore some design and implementation decisions can be controversial. If you have any suggestion on how to make things work better please share.

In general there are two main conceptions currently:

### Tool
A tool is a specific [probably hardware] device which a ""peasant"" use to have a specific ""farm"" work done. Each tool has a number of tool-specific actions and fire tools-specific events.

To describe a tool I've decided to use power of Elixir Protocols. Each tool is a struct (actually it is an Ecto model under the hood) made out of [Peasant.Tool.State](peasant/lib/peasant/tool/state.ex) base module, each action is a named after the specific action protocol, each tool must have supported actions protocols implementations. The only exception at the moment is the Attach action which has `for: Any` implementation.

An example of a tool is the [Peasant.Tools.SimpleRelay](peasant/lib/peasant/tools/simple_relay.ex) with [TurnOn](peasant/lib/peasant/tools/simple_relay/action/turn_on.ex) and [TurnOff](peasant/lib/peasant/tools/simple_relay/action/turn_off.ex) actions. It handles a simple relay module (via GPIO pull up\pull down).

All available tools and their actions are recognizing via specific namespaces analysis and protocol enumeration, so Protocol consolidation must be on. The required namespaces should be set in [config.exs](peasant/config/config.exs) (search for `config :peasant, Actions` option).

TODO: Implement a ""chain of tools"" when it is possible to introduce tools which are using other tools resources in a way the parent tools can control own resources availability: for example, a simple relay require a GPIO pin, and currently there is no way to control if a new Simple Relay wants to work with the same GPIO pin as one of the already added replays. If we add a GPIO tool first then we can link it with a simple relay instance after the first `attach` so it will deny the second `attach` with an another relay.

### Automation

Automation is a list of tools actions, like a cyclic schedule. 

For example, one of my current automations:

![Automation Screenshot 1](images/automation-001.png?raw=true)

![Automation Screenshot 2](images/automation-002.png?raw=true)


More main part implementation details is in the `peasant` (README)[peasant/README.md], but it can (and most possibly is) outdated.

## Supported tools (devices)

- [X] Simple GPIO-pin controlled relay 
- [ ] ds18b20 1wire temperature sensor

## UI
UI is based on the Phoenix LiveView. 

Currently it allows to 

list Tools:

![Tools list](images/tools-001.png?raw=true)

list current, add new automations:

![Automations list](images/automation-003.png?raw=true)

start, stop a specific automation, add, delete, pause or alter automation steps.

UI doesn't have any tests as of yet.

## OTA Updates

The project uses [Nerves Hub](https://www.nerves-hub.org/) for automatic OTA firmware updates.

## Other
Please don't forget to change required `firmware` configs. You should at lease create `firmware/config/target.secret.exs` file with salts:

```elixir
import Config

config :peasant, PeasantWeb.Endpoint,
  secret_key_base: ""YOUR SECRET KEY BASE: use `mix phx.gen.secret`"",
  live_view: [signing_salt: ""YOUR SIGNING KEY: use `mix phx.gen.secret 32`""]
```

Also the project uses VintageNet WiFi Wizard to configure wifi: it creates a WiFi network with SSID `peasant_wifi` if no networks were configured before, you can connect into it and enter your main SSID\password settings.

You can use try to use `http://peasant.local` URL to connect to the UI or connect with ssh to the Nerves command prompt.

The following text is almost unaltered original Nerves poncho example README. 

## Hardware

This example serves a Phoenix-based web page over the network. The steps below
assume you are using a Raspberry Pi Zero, which allows you to connect a single
USB cable to the port marked ""USB"" to get both network and serial console
access to the device. By default, this example will use the virtual Ethernet
interface provided by the USB cable, assign an IP address automatically, and
make it discoverable using mDNS (Bonjour). For more information about how to
configure the network settings for your environment, including WiFi settings,
see the [`vintage_net` documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/vintage_net/).

## How to Use this Repository

1. Connect your target hardware to your host computer or network as described
   above
2. Prepare your Phoenix project to build JavaScript and CSS assets:

    ```bash
    # These steps only need to be done once.
    cd peasant
    mix deps.get
    cd assets
    npm install
    ```

3. Build your assets and prepare them for deployment to the firmware:

    ```bash
    # Still in ui/assets directory from the prior step.
    # These steps need to be repeated when you change JS or CSS files.
    node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode production
    cd ../
    mix phx.digest
    ```

4. Change to the `firmware` app directory

    ```bash
    cd ../firmware
    ```

5. Specify your target and other environment variables as needed:

    ```bash
    export MIX_TARGET=rpi3
    # If you're using WiFi (not necessary as WiFi should be configured via wizard):
    # export NERVES_NETWORK_SSID=your_wifi_name
    # export NERVES_NETWORK_PSK=your_wifi_password
    ```

6. Get dependencies, build firmware, and burn it to an SD card:

    ```bash
    mix deps.get
    mix firmware
    mix firmware.burn
    ```

7. Insert the SD card into your target board and connect the USB cable or otherwise power it on
8. Wait for it to finish booting (5-10 seconds)
9. Open a browser window on your host computer to `http://peasant.local/`
10. You should see a ""Tech'n'Plants Peasant"" main page

Project presented in the Software Engineering course (Universidade de Aveiro), 2018.

The main goal was to develop a system capable of helping the farmers to monitor its farm, using different types of sensors.
The system collects the data from the sensors in farms and shows them in real-time, also allowing to define alerts based on the data coming from the sensors.

The platform was made using SpringBoot (Java) and followed DevOps techniques.
Several technologies were used to follow a micro-services arquitecture, like Docker, Kafka, Kafka streams, ReactJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Jenkins, Cucumber, TICK Stack, ELK Stack, among others.

PVMAPS lets you simulate the energy yield potential of solar farms anywhere in the world. 

Current version supports the following solar farm configurations: (i) systems with fixed-tilted c-Si monofacial and  (ii) systems with vertical bifacial modules with ground-sculpting.

The simulator requires MATLAB (version > 2016a) to be installed on your computer. 

For an example of how to use the simulator, open the 'run_singleLocation.mlx' in this folder  with MATLAB.

For theory underlying the code is discussed in **“Principles of Solar Cells: Connecting Perspectives on Device, System, Reliability, and Data Science” by Professor Alam and Khan  (https://doi.org/10.1142/12139).**

## What's this?
This project consists of a device equipped with moisture and light sensors with the facility to grow greenhouse and indoor plants inside of it as well as a mobile app and a cloud server. While growing a plant, the users can leave the headache of watering and lighting them regularly entirely to the device. With the powerful software running inside the app, users will be able to monitor and control the water and lighting that their plant recieves, as well as view monthly overall performance graphs of the plants, get tips, set to do lists for each device and much more.

## Prerequisites
* A smartphone running Android 8.0+
* A good internet connection
* Dummy credentials for a [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com) channel. If you don't wanna create an account for yourself, use our credentials:
  * ID: 1315722
  * Password: FWSEJN2A2UOMPZ6H
* Optionally, set up the cicuit as explained in the cicuits section 

## Setting up the app
1. Install the app on your android device by following [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ok9KaMp1aSh3Tp1zmp3DB-eL4I84cjbG/view?usp=sharing) from the device to start the installation automatically.
2. Open it and grant all necessary permissions
3. Add a device using the dummy credentials or by creating a ThingSpeak channel with 4 fields and then using it's credentials. While creating a channel, please follow the same pattern as that of our [demo channel](https://thingspeak.com/channels/1315722).
4. Select the device that you added
5. Now, you can interact with your device through Grovi, a virtual assistant or by directly switching values from the app.
If you want way more granular control over the app or want to build it from source, check out the [directory structure & contribution guide](https://github.com/vishalkrishnads/Grovit/blob/master/.github/Code%20Structure.md).

## Setting up your microcontrollers (optional)
1. Complete the connections as per the [circuit guide](https://github.com/vishalkrishnads/Grovit/blob/master/.github/Circuitry.md) and upload the `microcontroller.ino` found in the `microcontroller/` directory in this repo.
2. Power up the cicuit

## Testing
Now, you should be able to switch the Lights and water tap ON & OFF from the app itself. If you have set up the microcontrollers, once they've connected to Wi-Fi, you should be able to see the lights and water pump responding to your commands from the app.

## Grovi
Grovi is our virtual assistant built into the app itself. It can do many things such as controlling the light and water pump, tell you the weather and do much more. You can activate Grovi for each farm from within the details of that farm by clicking on the green mic button. You can ask her things like:
* Turn on the lights
* Take care of everything
* What's the climate?

## Features
The app has many features to assist gardeners which includes, but is not limited to:
1. To Do Lists
2. Ability to add tips from expert farmers for the not-so experienced ones to follow
3. Monthly Analytics & graphs for water usage and lighting history
4. Ability to implement account based data saving and cloud storage within the app

# PLOWMAN

![PLOWMAN screenshot](/doc/screenshot.png)

A procedural farming game inspired by [Piers Plowman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piers_Plowman).

🚧 *PROCEED WITH CAUTION* 🚧

🏗 *PROJECT UNDER CONSTRUCTION*  🏗

# Overview

> In a summer season when the sun shone softly
>
> I wrapped myself in woolens as if I were a sheep;
>
> In a hermit's habit, unholy in his works,
>
> I went out into the world to hear wonders
>
> And to see many strange and seldom-known things.

The dreamer will seek, among other things, the allegorical characters Dowel (""Do-Well""), Dobet (""Do-Better""), and Dobest (""Do-Best"").

Grow crops in a procedural world. Earn rewards for undertaking wholesome actions. Barter with nearby civilians.

If you do too much evil, the adventure ends.

In ""the real world"", specific interactions, item placement, and NPC spawns should be randomized.

Dreams which tell the story of Piers Plowman are scripted by hand.

## Running the game

You can run the game using Godot engine, version 3.1+.

Binaries for various systems are made available on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Terkwood/PLOWMAN/releases).

## About the Project

The Code is written in [P5JS](https://p5js.org/). I also coded a [Squirrel 🐿️ that lives in the Forest](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Squirrel) and searches for Acorns, using the [P5.Play-Library](https://p5play.org/) which in turn uses the [Planck Physics Engine](https://piqnt.com/planck.js/).

## Initialization

- Generate a Background out of Grass-Tiles
- Generate a number of Chickens (You can change ""numberOfChickens"" to get more / less Chickens)
- Generate a number of Bees (You can change ""numberOfBees"" to get more / less Bees)
- Generate a random Pattern of Plants / Flowers
- Generate Food-Piles at random Places
- Draws the Fence

## 🐔The Chickens🐔

- The Chickens will search for Food
- When they find Food, they'll eat it
- When the current Food is gone, the Chicken will search for more Food
- Sometimes a Chicken will take a short break, standing still, to be more natural-looking

## 🐝The Bees🐝
- The Bees fly all over the screen, from right to left 🐝
- Bees fly at random Speeds on their X-Axis. Some are slower, some are faster
- To look more natural, the Bees oscillate on their Y-Axis
- When a bee hits the left edge of the Screen, it dies
- A new Bee is generated in it's place

## 🌾The Food🌾

- Food will spawn in random Locations
- When a Food-Pile is eaten, a new Food-Pile will spawn at a new random Location

- **A**mazon Web Services, a cloud service that can host software.
- **R**eact, a frontend **JavaScript** web framework.
- **M**ySQL, a relational database management system.

## What is FARM?
The FARM stack is more or less an extension of the LAMP stack with these notable changes:
- The middleware framework is explicit (Flask)
- Like the MEAN stack, it includes an application presentation layer (React)
- The environment which the software runs on is instead replaced by PaaS/IaaS cloud computing services (AWS)
- There is no opinion for which operating system to use

### Flask
Flask is used to write the web APIs / middleware that can communicate between the web UI and the web backend / database. This is the core of the entire application that glues the pieces of the full stack application together.

Note that this particular template does not use an ORM, and instead uses the `pymysql` module. This means developers need to write SQL queries, but can maximize the complexity of the queries they need to run on the database.

### Amazon Web Services
AWS is the cloud service which the application can be hosted on. We can host the entire software stack on the following services:
- **AWS Lambda** for hosting our applications on a serverless infrastructure. We can also choose to host our Flask APIs via [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa), making deployment to production exceedingly easy.
- **AWS RDS** for hosting our database. 
- **AWS S3** for storing all sorts of other objects like images and files.

This means that developers can keep everything on one platform and minimize DevOps / IT work.

### React
React is the framework which the web UI runs on. The React application may also be run on AWS Lambda with NodeJS.

This template uses JavaScript / JSX, but TypeScript may be used as well.

### MySQL
MySQL is the relational database which the web backend uses. This can also be hosted on AWS through its RDS service.

## How to Run Locally
To run this web application, the following needs to be done:
1. Setup a local MySQL instance using the schema in `db/`
2. Install modules for the API and UI
3. Run the API and UI locally

### Database Setup
To set up the MySQL instance, follow these steps:
1. Create and connect to a MySQL database instance. The most common ways to do this are with MySQL Workbench or `mysql` on the Linux command line interface.
2. Run `sample.sql` within the instance. It will create a schema called `SampleInventory` and then initialize a table called `Inventory`.

### API Setup
The codebase for the Flask API can be found in the `api/` directory.

#### First-time Setup (macOS)
1. Create a Python virtual environment with `virtualenv farm-stack` after navigating to that directory.
2. Activate it with `source farm-stack/bin/activate`
3. Navigate to `api/` and run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all Python modules necessary for the API.
4. Open `dbcreds.py` in the `api/` directory and edit database credentials as needed.

#### Running the API
1. Activate the virtual environment from above.
2. Run `python3 app.py` to run the API on `http://localhost:8080`.

### UI Setup
The codebase for the React UI can be found in the `ui/` directory. This template uses `yarn` as its package manager; it is crucial that developers do not mix other package managers like `npm` when adding new modules.

Note that packages like `react-bootstrap` are missing from this template.

#### First-time Setup (macOS)
1. Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies required.

#### Running the UI
1. Run `yarn start` to run in development mode.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on the browser.

# compatabily
currently, the easter event allows the farming of insta-monkeys. 
there are 2 scripts, 1 for insta and monkey money farming, and one just for money farming.
use the no money one for only money, and for collection events, use the onther one.
# will i get banned for using this!?!?!??!
most likey not. if you are still sceptical, run steam in offline mode.
# How do i farm insta monkeys!!!!!
right now the insta farming one only works if there is a BTD6 event that has the insta-monkey loot crates.
# Why is insta farming so slow!?
currently I have only one recorded game, more shall come in the future.

An ansible collection used to create a farm of virtual machines and control these with tasks categorized in different provision phases orchestrated by Ansible.

- **What**: Create a farm composed by multiple VM for different platform and targets

- **Where**: into any personal or professional available hypervisor hosts of a network

- **Why**: to create a CI/CD or any use case workflow of a single or multiple projects using the same farm structure

- **How**: by definiting some repeatable deploy jobs to create a VM and provision it with some repeatable CI/CD and testing jobs

- **When**: anytime a developer, a webhook or any type of periodic job request it

This collection allow ""**What**"", ""**Where**"", ""**Why**"", ""**How**"" according to your project needs.
The ""**When**"" is up to you :-) .

The roles of this collection focus on:

- Create VM definitions from different configuration files separating platform-specific data and target-specific data
- Provision an hypervisor host with VMs of different VM definitions
- Provision a VM (guest) host with **repeateable** and **cachable** provision phases by using **snapshots**
- **Don't require root privileges** whenever possible and for the use main use cases of this collection don't require root privileges by default.

The main use case for this collection is to create a VM farm made of different platforms and targets to distribute repeateable and cachable provision phases over these like project builds and testing scripts.

This collection is flexible so you can use the features it provide also for other purposes.

All roles of this collection uses some common terms:

- The `VM configuration` is a convenient object which describes a permutations of all platforms and targets pairs that we need as virtual machines and each of those are going to be generated in the form of `VM definition` object after parsing some `platform and target definitions` files.
- The `VM definition` object describes the characteristics of a VM about the hardware it emulates, the firmware or OS that is installed onto it and other parameters like credentials and network host configuration. It's a combination of `platform` and `target` definitions.
- The `platform` definition (synonym of OS) is the definition of the used OS, disks, network, credentials, VM components that may be required by the OS. This specify also how a resource should be processed and installed later into libvirt.
- The `target` definition (synonym of machine, architecture of machine) is the definition of emulated hardware components in each `VM definition`, like CPU, RAM, machine type, emulator, etc ...

The Hypervisor and VM provisioning
----------------------------------

the `VMs configurations` should be defined in the hypervisors inventory and these configurations vars should be then provided as input of the `parse_vms_definitions` role such that it generates the `VM definitions` items in a `virtual_machines` list.

These `VM definitions` should be prepared with the `init_vm_connection` role first, installed using the `kvm_provision` role later and provisioned using the `guest_provision` role finally

### Standard Usage and How it works

- For each host of hypervisors
  - ( optional: Assign `VMs configurations` to the hypervisor host using `roles/vm_dispatcher` )
  - Provide all `VMs configurations` as input of `roles/parse_vms_definitions`
    - This will generate a list of `VM Definition` items called `virtual_machines`
  - Each `vm` item of `virtual_machines` should be provided as input of:
    - `roles/init_vm_connection`
      - to add a new ansible inventory host entry to the global inventory
      - to configure the connection to allow the controller to connect to the VM
        - Eventually defining a libvirt network and a DHCP entry for connection such that the vm should be connected to it
      - After that
        - each VM host is added as ansible inventory host
        - the `VM definition` is added as `vm` inventory host var
        - the hypervisor's `inventory_hostname` is added as `kvm_host` inventory host var to keep a reference of its hypervisor node.
        - Each VM host are added to the following ansible groups:
          - `vms`
          - `""{{ vm.metadata.name }}""`
          - `""{{ vm.metadata.platform_name }}""`
          - `""{{ vm.metadata.target_name }}""`

- For each host in `vms` should run:
  - Delegated `roles/kvm_provision` to `kvm_host`, to define and install the `VM definition` stored in `vm` inventory host var
  - `roles/guest_provision` to provision the VM with the guest lifecycle

The VM Guest lifecycle
----------------------

The lifecycle of the provisioned VM runs the following workflow:

0. **Startup** 
   - Start the VM
   - Wait until connection is ready

1. **Init** use case phase
   - Restore to a '**init**' snapshot if exists
   - otherwise fallback to restore or create a '**clean**' snapshot and run the **init** phase:

      1. **dependencies** pre-phase
         - Run dependencies tasks (`{{ import_path }}/dependencies.yaml`)
      2. use case phase: 
         - Run init tasks `{{ import_path }}/init.yaml`
         - Create 'init' snapshot

2. **Main** use case phase: 
   - Run main tasks `{{ import_path }}/main.yaml`

3. **Terminate** use case phase: 
   - Run end tasks `{{ import_path }}/terminate.yaml` whether the main phase succeeds or fails

4. **shutdown**
   - Shutdown gracefully first the VM, otherwise force it
 
Where `import_path` is a subpath that match with the most detailited phase file location, according to the target and platform type of the VM.
The `import_path` is the one in the following priority list path which contains a phase file:
- `""{{ ( phases_lookup_dir_path, vm.metadata.platform_name, vm.metadata.target_name| path_join }}""`
- `""{{ ( phases_lookup_dir_path, vm.metadata.platform_name ) | path_join }}""`
- `""{{ phases_lookup_dir_path }}""`

**Why:** A use case may needs specific tasks/vars for a target on platform or only platform; for instance:

- *debian_11* folder (`vm.metadata.platform_name` value in `platforms/debian_sid.yml`)
    - *amd64* folder (`vm.metadata.target_namevalue )
      - tasks or vars files, ... specific for *amd64* targets in *debian_11* platforms
    - *arm64* folder (`vm.metadata.target_namevalue )
      - tasks or vars files, ... specific for *arm64* targets in *debian_11* platforms
- *fedora_36* folder (`vm.metadata.platform_name` value )
    - *amd64* folder (`vm.metadata.target_namevalue )
      - tasks or vars files, ... specific for *amd64* targets in *fedora_36* platforms
    - tasks or vars files, ... specific *fedora_36* platforms but any target
- tasks or vars files, ... generic for any platform and target which file does not exists with a specific `import_path` sub path

The `import_path` is useful when some dependencies have different alias in some platform's packets manager, or user needs ""ad hoc"" tasks/vars for some others use cases.

Support and Requirements

Read the documentation of each role for specific role's requirements.
The following tables shows support and requirements for the full collection.

- Required requirements are minimal and allow the collection to work but you will need at least some of recommended requirements to use in most cases
- Recommended requirements are used inside some builtin templates, target definitions and callback-tasks for common use cases

**Note: QEMU or KVM are recommended** for the following reasons:

- The collection support `qemu:///session` URI by default only when the `VDE` and `user` (userspace connections) virtual networks types are supported by the hypervisor.
- **[Since libvirt 9.0.0](https://libvirt.org/news.html#v9-0-0-2023-01-16)** the support of `passt` as network interface backend for [userspace connections](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#userspace-slirp-or-passt-connection) has been added but it's [unstable](https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/issues/462), and so the VM template will use the network type `user` with that backend **since libvirt 9.2.0** only.
- **Prior libvirt 9.2.0** The `VDE` and `user` virtual networks are supported only when custom network interface can be added via the XML libvirt template through the libvirt [QEMU namespace](https://libvirt.org/drvqemu.html#pass-through-of-arbitrary-qemu-commands) for now. So other hypervisors may require specific extra configuration like definining other VM XML template.
- the [SSH connection plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ssh_connection.html) support may be achieved with `qemu:///session` only when SSH port of the VM is reachable from the hypervisor. The `user` network interface built with the **QEMU** namespace allow to specify a port forward with the `hostfwd` option or alternativelly using port forward with `passt`; but the first one is not supported by libvirt XML format for other hypervisors, and the second one is not supported on libvirt versions prior than `9.2.0`.
- the [community.libvirt.libvirt_qemu connection plugin](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/libvirt/libvirt_qemu_connection.html) is supported only for local (ansible controller) hypervisor and **only if** you pre-install the **QEMU Guest Agent** on VM OS. The use of `ssh+qemu` URIs has not been tested.

Attempting to optimize crop placement in stardew valley.

I'm pretty sure this is an np problem.

This is an imense amount of different configurations that need to be checked. Moving this to cuda would be advantageous, atleast for the validation of a farming configuration. I'm running into memory issues, so something like c/++ is probably required. Any tips for figuring out a configuration is going to be sub optimal before exploring it further would be extremely advantagous.

# Problem Description

We have a player on a square grid. The player can move up, down, left, and right on the grid. They can not move in a diagonal. The player can also only water crops above, below, left, and right of them. They can not water in a diagonal. The player has a plot of land for farming represented as n by m matrix, where n and m are integers and greater than 0 and n can but not have to be equal to m. The goal is to maximize the number of crops on a nxm plot of land so that they can still be watered by the player. If a crop is not watered by the player it dies. The player has a plot of land for farming located in a plot of land they own. They can walk around the perimeter of farm land and enter their field at any point they'd like. This means a 5x5 grid is actually a 7x7 with the outer layer having no crops. At any cell in the grid it can be marked as either an `x`, which means it is free for the player to walk on, or a `c` where a crop has been planted and the player is not able to walk on.

## Medium Difficulty

Crops need to be surrounded by a scare crow or they can be potentially eaten by crows. The likelyhood of being eaten by crows changes with the number of crops present and is hard to deduce by the behaviour described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/7bndnd/does_anyone_know_exactly_how_crows_work/). Scarecrows can protect crops with an 8 cell radius.

## Hard Difficulty

There exists 3 different sprinkler systems in the game, each being better than the last. The cells they cover is dictated by `.` and a cell uncovered is dictated as `o`. If the sprinkler covers a given area then the player does not have to water it.

# Strategies

| symbol | description |
| -------| ----------- |
| x      | Clear area  |
| c      | Spot for a crop |

## Bruteforce

There's absilutely no way this is scalable. The only pruning going on is stopping the search if the board can not be traversed by the player. After being smart with a job system the time reduced from ~2m30s to ~30s on 8 core computer.

Running a 6x6 board causes me to run out of memory and have the program crash. Even if we had enough memory to run this, it still took a 5x5 30s to run. 6x6 - 5x5 = 36 - 25 = 11 new tiles to explore, each with the option to either be a crop or a square the player can walk in. That's 2^11 more solutions multiplied by the time it takes to explore the first 25. This ends up with 2^11 * 30 = 61440s = 1024m = 17 hours of running.

Total Crops: 21

c c x c c
c c x c c
c c x c c
c c x c c
c c c c c
```

## Pruning based on niave best guess layout

The next idea I came up with is using some strategy to come up with a pretty good layout, but not optimal. Then with this layout we know when exploring solutions, if it ever becomes impossible to become better than the guess, then we can stop exploring. The best guess algorithm for layout took the largest side, and would lay crops along it in pairs of 2, so if we had a 5x5 grid, then our best guess would return:

```
c c c c c
c c c c c 
x x x x x 
c c c c c 
c c c c c 
```

Which is 20 crops, close to the optimal 21 crops.

### Results

This actually ended up helping immensely, and allowed me to run a 6x6 for the first time.

c c c x c c
x x x x x c
c c c c c c
c c c c c c
```

This current best guess does not scale however. If we could figure out the optimal number of crops before starting this run then it would help tremendousely, as all the program would have to do at that point is try placing them. After figuring out the optimal placement had 28 crops in a 6x6, I just made the best guess function return 28 to see the speed improvements. It went from taking 7m37 to JUST 2 SECONDS. Picking a number greater than 28 stops in less than 2 seconds with an incomplete board.

x c c x c c
c c c x c c
x x c x c c
c c c x c c

```

I took this and hard coded the guess to 40 for a 7x7 board. The board never finishes so I'd knock down the hard coded guess by one until the board finished. As a result I finally got a valid board with 12 minutes of runtime.

7x7
```

c c x c x x c
c c x c c c c
c c x c c c c
c x x x x x c
c c c c c c c
c c c c c c c
```

From this we see that even if we know the optimal number of crops for any board, coming up with a valid configuration will still take way too much time on larger boards. Which warrants the need for better strategies to be implemented along with this.

## Pruning based on uncovered regions

If a region is every left wholy empty then it can be shown that it can always be optimized. For example if a configuration contains a 3x3 region that is always empty, then we can always improve it by placing a crop in the center

```
x x x   can be improved to    x x x
x x x  ====================>  x c x
x x x                         x x x

```

I am making the assumption that this also applied to a 2x2 grid, but I can't prove it in my mind. However I have not seen a solution yet that ever contains a empty 2x2 grid in it. So I check to see if a grid ever contains an empty 2x2 with no crops, and if it does then I prune it. Doing this reduced the 7x7 grid by 8 minutes (12 minutes to 4 minutes). But is far from what's needed if I want to start evaluating 8x8 grids.

## Smaller optimizations

I realized im doing a breath first search to determine if a board can be traversed by the player even if I just added an empty square. Since adding empty squares will always ensure the board is traversable, I stopped doing the BFS. I also stopped initializing some arrays every expansion and am keeping up with arrays long term. Doing these two things dropped the time for a 7x7 by a minutes, taking a total of 3m36s to compute now.

This is a custom component for [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) that adds support for the Miracle Grow [AeroGarden](http://www.aerogarden.com) Wifi hydroponic gardens.

## Background

Overhaul of work done by [jacobdonenfeld](https://github.com/jacobdonenfeld/homeassistant-aerogarden) who picked up the torch from [ksheumaker](https://github.com/ksheumaker/homeassistant-aerogarden) who was inspired by a [forum post by epotex](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/first-timer-trying-to-convert-a-working-script-to-create-support-for-a-new-platform).  Utilizes the non-public Aerogarden API to read and write information for gardens added to a user's Aerogarden account.

## Data available

A device will be created for each Aerogarden registered in a user's Aerogarden account.  A device has the following sensors associated with it:

### Binary Sensors

* Light - `On` if garden light is on; `Off` otherwise
* Needs Nutrients - `Problem` if garden needs nutrients; `OK` otherwise
* Needs Water -  `Problem` if garden needs water; `OK` otherwise
* Pump - `Running` if garden pump is running; `Not running` otherwise

### Manual Installation

Copy `custom_components/aerogarden` into your Home Assistant `$HA_HOME/config` directory, then restart Home Assistant

## Initial Setup

Add an integration entry as normal from integration section of the home assistant settings.  You'll need the following configuration items

* **Email**: The e-mail registered with your AC Infinity account.
* **Password**: The password for this account.

![Initial-Setup](/images/initial-setup.png)

## Additional Configuration

![Additional-Configuration](/images/additional-configuration.png)

## Note about the Aerogarden API

This integration uses a non-public API to fetch information; the same API that is used by Aerogarden devices.  This API has had a number of outages this last year, which leads to issues using this integration.  Please make sure this status badge is reporting green before opening any issues, as a red status would indicate problems with the API and not the Integration

A program that will farm and create commits on your GitHub account.

## Introduction
This project was created simply to farm GitHub commits on your account for 3 reasons:
<br>
1. Keep your account active.
2. Look cool.
3. Flex on your friends the fact that your life is just non-existent.

## Results
A long time ago I have create a very simple version and tested it on an alternative account and these were the results:
<br>
<br>
![112,000 commits on GitHub](src/results.jpg)

## How it works?
You might wonder what is the formula used by this program
<br>
This program does a simple operation using the built-in Python module `random` to generate a random integer from 1 to 10.
After choosing a number, if the number is 1, 2 or 3 it waits 15 seconds then chooses another number.
The rest of the numbers correspond to a progrmamming language that the program writes a simple script with to output ""Hello, world!"" then publish the file on GitHub with the name Temp- then a random salt then the file type of that programming language.
<br>
Here are the programming languages the numbers correspond to:
<br>
<br>
4. C++
<br>
5. C
<br>
6. Python
<br>
7. Jupyter
<br>
8. JavaScript
<br>
9. TypeScript
<br>
10. Brainfuck
<br>

## How to use
Using this program is very simple.
If you look in the files of this repository you will find a file called `main.py` containing the code.
All you have to do is create an empty folder, create a python file inside of it and insert the code, change the username with yours and write the name of an empty repository on your account to be used then run the program using any Python interpreter.

1. Install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and run the installer.
2. After setting Git Bash, enter the command `git config --global user.name ""Your Name""` and replace Your Name with your actual name.
3. After running that first command run the other command `git config --global user.email ""user@domain.com""` and replace user@domain.com with the email you used to sign up for GitHub.
4. Copy the contents of the file `main.py` from this repository.
5. Create an empty repository on your account (preferably with the name `commit`).
6. Create an empty folder on your computer dedicated to this program.
7. Create a Python file in that new folder and paste the program's code inside of it.
8. Change the username inside (currently written mine) and change the GitHub repository to the name of the GitHub repository you created.
9. Run the program using any Python interpreter.

*The program should now work. If any errors or issues occur, don't hesitate to create an issue here in this repository.*
<br>
<br>

**WARNING: DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT IN THE DESKTOP OR ANY DIRECTORY SIMILAR TO THAT. PLEASE CREATE A FOLDER DEDICATED TO THIS FARM TO PREVENT ISSUES WITH YOUR COMPUTER OR RANDOM FILES APPEARING ON YOUR COMPUTER.**

IrisFarmBot - автоматический бот для фарма ирис-койнов


## Этот бот больше не работает, эта версия больше не поддерживается! Новый, улучшенный IrisFarmBot находится в [IrisFarmBotWeb](https://github.com/MrSmitix/IrisFarmBotWeb)
Если техничка вам не интересна и вообще вы на этом сайте в первый раз, можете сразу подключаться к фарму на [IrisFarmBot.ru](https://IrisFarmBot.ru/)

## А как это работает?

Данный бот просто автоматизирует отправку комментария с текстом `Ферма` к [посту](https://vk.com/iris_cm?w=wall-174105461_35135). В принципе вы можете делать это и в ручную, но зачем?

## Инструкция по запуску

Для работы бота можно использовать бесплатный сервис [Heroku](https://heroku.com), далее в инструкций будет рассматриваться запуск именно на нём. Но так же бота без проблем можно запустить на собственном пк или сервере.

Инструкция:
1. Зарегистрироваться на [Heroku](https://heroku.com) и создать приложение.
2. Скопировать репозитой к себе в профиль и изменить настройки в файле [settings.py](https://github.com/MrSmitix/IrisFarmBot/blob/main/settings.py) если это требуется.
3. Во вкладке `Deploy` в панели управления приложением выбрать `GitHub`, найти репозиторий с этим ботом и подключить его к приложению нажав кнопку `Connect`.
4. Во вкладке `Settings` найти `Config Vars` и добавить новую переменную окружения с KEY `TOKENS` и VALUE `ВАШ ТОКЕН` (или несколькими токенами через запятую `токен1,токен2,токен3`) (получить токен можно на [vkhost](http://vkhost.github.io)).
5. Во вкладке `Deploy` нажать на кнопку `Deploy Branch` и дождаться сборки проекта.
6. Далее потребуется [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) который нужно установить
7. Авторизоваться в Heroku CLI
```shell script
heroku login
```
8. Запустить бота
```shell script
heroku ps:scale clock=1 --app НАЗВАНИЕ_ВАШЕГО_ПРИЛОЖЕНИЯ_В_HEROKU
```

Через заданный в `DELAY` промежуток времени (по умолчанию 4 часа и 15 секунд) бот начнёт работать, и каждые `DELAY` секунд будет получать вам ирис-койны. Но не чаще чем раз в 4 часа.

## Проверка работы бота

Вы можете проверить то что бот работает просмотрев его логи командой
```shell script
heroku logs --tail --app НАЗВАНИЕ_ВАШЕГО_ПРИЛОЖЕНИЯ_В_HEROKU
```
В случае если по какой-то причине бот перестал работать, вы так же можете узнать причину просмотрев логи.
ВАЖНО! При стандартных настройках приложения комментарий будет удаляться, как и уведомление от группы Iris. 

## Отключение бота

Для отключения бота достаточно просто удалить приложение в Heroku, что можно сделать нажав на кнопку `Delete app...` во вкладке `Settings`. Удаление репозитория не отключит бот!

Или выполнив команду
```shell script
heroku ps:scale clock=0 --app НАЗВАНИЕ_ВАШЕГО_ПРИЛОЖЕНИЯ_В_HEROKU
```

## Очень интересно но ничего не понятно, можно как-то попроще?

Можно, вы можете получить токен на [vkhost](http://vkhost.github.io) и прислать его мне [ВКонтакте](https://vk.com/mrsmitix) или [Телеграм](https://t.me/MrSmitix) с просьбой подключить к фарму ирисов. И я добавлю его в своего уже запущенного и рабочего бота. Но настоятельно рекомедую НИКОГДА и НИКОМУ не сообщать свой токен, так как по сути это тоже самое что и логин с паролем от вашей страницы.

## General Information
- This project was created as a first project for the Software Engineering Immersive Program at General Assembly
- The purpose of this project was to reproduce a game mechanic (inspired by the &copy;Tamagotchi) of using timers to showcase the pet's current state and trying to keep it alive through actionable items that increment the pet's hunger, happiness, and sleepiness stats.

<hr> 

## Version
- Tiny Farm - version 1.0

## Features
The current features:
- Choose the type of farm animal you want to raise
- Six different options: goat, sheep, pig, cow, chicken, bunny
- Name your farm animal

When the user presses the start button, the game screen transitions into a screen asking for the user to choose one of six farm animals by clicking on their associated picture (chicken, bunny, cow, goat, sheep, pig). Upon clicked, the animal's icon will light up and the user must enter a name for the animal in an input-field. The user must enter a valid name (not empty string) for the confirm button to work and bring them to the game screen.

3. After submitting, the screen will transition to the game screen showcasing revealing the baby animal who is sleeping. The user may wake the animal by clicking on the image of it. The timer on the message section will show time kept alive and start counting up, the age of the animal will start at 0 and increment over time as well. 

4. Upon reveal, the hunger, happiness, and sleepiness meters of the animal appears along with 3 new buttons on the bottom of the screen (feed, cuddle, and sleep). The meters begin to decrease by different rates and the user must interact with the buttons in order to feed, cuddle, and make the animal go to sleep. When the buttons are pressed, the corresponding metric to the actionable button will increase depending on the type of animal.

5. As the time passes and the animal will be animated across the screen, moving left and right. While the animal is still alive, the animal will start growing (two stages: baby -> adult), 3 minutes of being kept alive the animal will grow to full adult size.

6. If animal is kept alive in adult size for 2 more minutes (total game time and time kept alive reaches 5 minutes), then the game will be over and the animal will be sent to a loving barn, so the player gets the Game Over - Successful screen and can choose to raise another animal by pressing the reset game button.

7. At any point if the hunger, sleep, or happiness, meter reaches 0, the animal passes away and the Game over - RIP screen appears where the player can press the reset game button to reset the entire game from the beginning.

Data parallel and stream parallel skeletons implemented in erlang.

## compilation, debug and cleanup
Once you have moved to ske-pi's root directory, you can compile all sources to object code.


` make all ` or ` make ` may be used to compile with debug mode turned on.

In this mode, some information regarding inter-process communication (and timeouts, if any have occurred), as well as function calls for each skeleton will be saved to a log file (located inside the *ske-pi/logs* directory by default).

` make all DEBUG= ` or ` make DEBUG= ` will compile with debug mode turned off.

` make clean ` may be used to remove the directory containing all the object files and keep the log files.

` make cleanall ` will remove both object files and the log files generated previously.

## usage examples
Each module has its own usage function printing a brief description and giving a simple usage example.


Once you have compiled ske-pi, you may:
* start the Erlang shell with ` cd ebin; erl ` from ske-pi's root directory
* call the usage function for a given skeleton. Via the Erlang shell, use the following command:
```
> <module_name>:usage().
```

* additionally, you may test the stream parallel skeletons' performance using an example with a default configuration. Like so:
```
> test_stream:benchmark().
```

* similarly, you may run the data parallel skeletons example. Write:
```
> test_mapred:benchmark().
```

* the above is also available for the skeletons implementing the google mapreduce skeleton. Try it with:
```
> test_mapred_google:benchmark().
```

* for the stream parallel skeletons example, it is possible to configure the length of the list, the length of the chunks onto which the list is split, the number of worker processes and the number of schedulers used (N.B. dependent on the machine used to run the tests)
* you may also configure the length of the list, the length of chunks and the number of schedulers used for the data parallel skeletons example
* for the google mapreduce example, you may input the name of a directory containing your own test files, an atom to be used to perform an unix grep-like operation on the test files and the number of scherdulers used (please note that the directory with your own test files **must** be located inside ske-pi's top directory and it **must** be in string format)
* the erlang shell may be exited with the following command: ` q(). `

## acknowledgements
The stream skeleton (*stream.erl*) is taken and then modified from the [skel](https://github.com/ParaPhrase/skel) library for the [ParaPhrase Project](http://calvados.di.unipi.it/paragroup/projects/).

Author: Eric Latham

Email: ericoliverlatham@gmail.com

## Description

I initially developed this program as a team leader for a final project in a software engineering course taught by [Dr. Ramaraju Rudraraju](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramarajur/) at [UAB](https://www.uab.edu/) with the help of Tahseen Robbani, Wesley Hataway, Daniel Swinney, and Hardik Patel.

This program is a prototype for a farmer utility application built with [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javase-clienttechnologies.htm) as an exercise in using design patterns such as [entity-control-boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-control-boundary), [composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern), [visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern), and [adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern).

![screenshot](img/screenshot.png)

## Classes

### Entity Classes

- **ItemComponent** class (composite, pro-transparency)
  - **Item** class
  - **ItemContainer** class
- **ItemComponentVisitor** class
  - **AggregatePurchasePriceVisitor** class
  - **AggregateMarketValueVisitor** class
- **AnimatedDroneInterface** class
  - **AnimatedDrone** class
  - **TelloDroneAdapter** class (adapts **TelloDrone** to **AnimatedDrone**)
- **TelloDrone** class (provided by Seth)

### Boundary Classes

- **Dashboard** class (main)

### Control Classes

- **DashboardController** class

### Other Classes

All classes other than `TelloDroneAdapter` in [the physical drone module](src/entity/adapter/physical) were provided by [Seth Lewis](https://gitlab.cs.uab.edu/jesusaur) from his [drone library](https://gitlab.cs.uab.edu/jesusaur/CS420_520_Drone_Library) in order for the adapter design pattern to be completed.

### Class Diagram

![Class Diagram](img/class_diagram.png)

## Features

### Farm Items Tree View

I used a [TreeView](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/TreeView.html) object to allow the user to add, edit, and remove `Items` and `ItemContainers` from the [Farm Map](#farm-map).

### Farm Map

I used a [Group](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/Group.html) object to contain and display the shape of each `Item` and `ItemContainer`, as well as the drone icon that is used in the [drone animation](#drone-animation).

### Drone Animation

I used an [ImageView](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/image/ImageView.html) object to display the drone icon in the farm map and [SequentialTransition](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/animation/SequentialTransition.html) objects to animate the drone icon for two different flight simulations:

- `Item`/`ItemContainer` visits
- full farm scans

Note that the drone animation feature is intended to mirror what a real drone would do on a real farm if commanded by the `TelloDroneAdapter` class. However, the `TelloDroneAdapter` is untested on real drones and currently only exists for simulation purposes.

### Automatic Save/Load

#### Description

I implemented a bonus feature that does the following things:

- automatically saves the root `ItemContainer` of the `Dashboard` every time a component is added, updated, or deleted
- automatically loads the previous saved root `ItemContainer` when the `Dashboard` is re-opened

This feature allows the `Dashboard` to ""remember"" its previous state so that the user does not have to recreate all of the desired farm items each time they run the application.

#### Implementation

To implement this feature, I added static methods in the `ItemContainer` class for saving and loading `ItemContainer` objects via JSON serialization and deserialization.

```java
public static void saveJSON(ItemContainer itemContainer, String filePath);
```

I used the `saveJSON` method in the `DashboardController` class to save the root `ItemContainer` as a JSON string in a file named `rootItemContainer.json` whenever changes were made by the user.

```java
public static ItemContainer loadJSON(String filePath);
```

I used the `loadJSON` method in the `DashboardController` class to load the previous root `ItemContainer` (saved as a JSON string in `rootItemContainer.json` by `saveJSON`) whenever the `Dashboard` and `DashboardController` objects are initialized (which is whenever the application starts).

In both `saveJSON` and `loadJSON`, I leveraged the power of [the Gson library](https://github.com/google/gson) to serialize and deserialize `ItemComponent` objects to/from JSON. `Gson` is a popular tool used for Java object-JSON serialization and deserialization, and I found it easy to use, especially with the help of its excellent documentation.

Also, I added the required `Gson` jars as dependencies in the project so that there would be no need to import `Gson` manually when building and running the project.

Этот скрипт создает и настраивает твинки для `CS 1.6` через программу `Sandboxie`. Установите один игровой клиент,
настройте `config.json` и `userconfig.cfg`, затем он сгенерирует нужное количество копий клиентов, а так же настроит за
вас `Sandboxie`.

Возможности:

* Разные ники и SteamID.
* Массовое открытие, закрытие и сворачивание твинков.
* Автоматическое подключение к серверу.
* Обход анти-афк плагинов.
* Указание задержки между запуском твинков.
* Указание количества желаемых твинков.
* Настройка твинков через файл конфигурации `userconfig.cfg`.
* Возможность модификации клиента. Установка читов, кастомные лого и прочее.

Варианты использования:

* Фрикилл на джайлах. Чтобы другие игроки не переводили вас за заключенных можно заполнить баланс охраны твинками.
* Фарм на серверах с лвл системой.

## Предварительная настройка

1. Установите `Node.js`.
2. Установите `Yarn` командой в терминале:

```shell
npm install -g yarn
```

3. Установите `Sandboxie-Plus`.
4. Может понадобиться добавить `cs-twinks-creator` в исключения антивируса. Это нужно из-за того,
   что `SteamID Changer By OSTROG` как и большинство читов распознается как вирус. Он никогда не вызывал у меня проблем,
   но так как исходный код закрыт, используйте его на свой страх и риск.

## Требования к игровому клиенту

Не каждая сборка `CS 1.6` подходят для создания твинков. От используемой сборки требуется:

1. Запускаться через песочницу `Sandboxie`.
2. Работать со `SteamID Changer By OSTROG`.
3. Исполнять файлы конфигурации, такие как `userconfig.cfg`.

## Проверенные игровые клиенты

Пожалуйста, дайте знать если вы найдете новый клиент. Следующие клиенты полностью подходят для создания твинков:

* [Counter-Strike 1.6 Clean English](https://xn----7sba0bce7bg3c.xn--p1ai/product/44-Counter_Strike_16_Original_ENG.html)

## Создание твинков

Перед запуском убедитесь что проделаны шаги по предварительной настройке. Учтите что скрипт перезапишет
настройки `Sandboxie`, если вы не хотите потерять их сохраните вашу конфигурацию.

1. Если вы хотите использовать собственный клиент `CS 1.6` поместите ваш клиент в директорию `user-data/clients/CS`.
   Иначе пропустите этот шаг. **Первоначальный клиент будет оставаться неизменным**
2. Настройте параметры запуска клиентов и их количество в файле `user-data/config.json`. Смотрите описание настроек
   ниже.
3. Настройте файл конфигурации `user-data/userconfig.cfg`, который содержит наиболее распространенные команды для
   первоначальной настройки клиента. Вы можете закомментировать или раскомментировать существующие настройки.
4. По желанию поместите модификации клиента в папку `user-data/mods` (вх, кастомные лого и прочее). Эта папка уже
   содержит `SteamID Changer By OSTROG` и будет слита с каждым твинком при их создании. Если вам нужна папка `cstrike`,
   создайте ее внутри `mods`.
5. Откройте терминал в директории `cs-twinks-creator` и выполните команду, чтобы установить зависимости проекта:

```shell
yarn install
```

6. В директории `cs-twinks-creator` выполните команду, чтобы запустить копирование и настройку твинков:

```shell
yarn run bootstrap
```

7. Чтобы открыть все твинки, запустите сгенерированный `start.bat` или выполните команду в
   директории `cs-twinks-creator`:

```shell
yarn run start
```

## Очистка системы

Для очистки твинков, сброса настроек `Sandboxie` и удаления `start.bat` выполните команду в
директории `cs-twinks-creator`:

```shell
yarn run cleanup
```

## Конфигурация (config.json)

* startTimeout — задержка после запуска каждой копии клиента
* windowedMode — запускать в оконном режиме
* lowGraphics — запускать с низкой графикой
* highPriority — запускать с высоким приоритетом
* shuffleClients — перемешивать клиенты
* activeClients — количество клиентов к запуску (min = 1, max = 32)
* clients — список клиентов (можно указать постоянный nickname и steamId)
  * nickname — никнейм (например - nickname: ""Player"")
  * steamId — steamId (например - steamId: ""8483213"")

## Failed to initialize authentication interface

Для решения этой ошибки проделайте следующее:

1. Запустите `regedit.exe`.
2. Найдите и удалите `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Valve`.
3. Если у вас есть `Steam`, придется перезайти в аккаунт.

## Как закрыть все твинки?

Вы можете убить все процессы `hl.exe` через контекстное меню `Sandboxie` нажав на `Завершить все процессы`.

## Как свернуть все твинки?

Вы можете свернуть / развернуть все программы в `Windows` горячей клавишей `Win + D`.

## Боты, искусственный интеллект

Если вам нужны умные игровые боты, обратите внимание на программу `XFakePlayers`.

1053,documentation,FarmDyn,FarmDyn,https://github.com/FarmDyn/documentation,https://api.github.com/repos/FarmDyn/documentation,Source code for the FarmDyn documentation 📚,"# FarmDyn Documentation
This is the manual for the FarmDyn documentation.
In this document the process on how a) to work on the documentation and b) build the website or PDF version of it will be described.

Please feel encouraged to play around with the documentation: There's nothing that can go broken (everything is under version control), and you'll see that writing Markdown is a breeze!

The latest version of the documentation will be available on
[http://www.ilr.uni-bonn.de/em/rsrch/farmdyn/FarmDynDoku/index.html](http://www.ilr.uni-bonn.de/em/rsrch/farmdyn/FarmDynDoku/index.html)

## Installation

No need to install. Just head to

`N:\em\work1\Pahmeyer\FarmDyn\FarmDynDoku\FarmDyn`


## Getting up and running
The documentation lives in the docs folder. Instead of a Word document, the documentation is written in Markdown. Markdown is a simple markup language. That means, instead of clicking buttons for making a text bold, italic or else, you can do it through simple commands. Please don't be afraid, as writing in Markdown does require almost no learning and should be as easy to use as Word. The main benefit over a Word file is that we can easily create a Website and a PDF from the same documentation source (among other benefits). You can read more about Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started).

Every chapter of the documentation is in it's own file with the file extension `.md`. The `.md` files can be opened and edited with any text editor of your choice (e.g. Notepad, KEdit, TextMate), however, it is recommended to use [Atom](https://atom.io/), because it has many built in features that help you to write in Markdown. The following hints and shortcuts will assume the usage of Atom.

### Starting a development version of the website with live updates
When working on the documentation, it is helpful to see the changes in realtime. This way you can also check if your formulas were typeset correctly or if images appear the way they should.

You can get a quick and nice preview by pressing `ctrl-shift-m` when you have a Markdown file open in Atom. However, this will not show you exactly how the website will look like.

In order to start the development website simply double-click the `startDevServer.cmd` file.

![Location of the startDevServer.cmd file](assets/folder_overview_devServ.png)

A new browser window (or tab, if the browser was already opened) will appear saying ""This Website is not available"". Now switch back to the command prompt window that was openend by `startDevServer.cmd` (it's the black icon in the taskbar) and wait until it says `Serving on http:...`.

![The command prompt window stating that the website is served](assets/cmd_window.png)

This will take 0 - 2 minutes. Now reload the browser window, and the Website will be displayed.

#### Changing the structure of the website
The structure of the website is determined by the contents of the `mkdocs.yml` file.

![The mkdocs.yml file contains all information relevant for the structure of the website.](assets/folder_overview_yml.png)

Everything indented after the `pages:` directive will be rendered as a page on the website.

The notation works as follows
```
- This will be the navigation headline: TheMatchingMarkdownFile.md
```

The file names will be relative to the `docs` folder.

See the following contents of the `mkdocs.yml` file for working examples of relative paths:
```yml
pages:
    - FarmDyn: index.md
    - About: about.md
    - Introduction: introduction.md
    - Dynamic Character: dynamics.md
    - Risk and Risk behavior: risk.md
    - GHG Accounting: ghgAcc.md
    - Coefficient Generator: coeffGen.md
    - Technical Realization: technical.md
    - Graphical User Interface: gui.md
    - References: References.md
    - Appendix: appendix.md
    - The Template Model:
       - Introduction: template/introduction.md
       - Herd Module: template/herd_module.md
       - Feeding module: template/feeding_module.md
       - Cropping, Land and Land Use: template/cropping__land_and_land_use.md
       - Labour: template/labour.md
       - Stables: template/stables.md
       - Other Type of Buildings: template/other_type_of_buildings.md
       - Farm Machinery: template/farm_machinery.md
       - Investments, Financing and Cash Flow Definition: template/investments__financing_and_cash_flow_definition.md
       - Manure: template/manure.md
       - Synthetic Fertilizers: template/synthetic_fertilizers.md
       - Plant Nutrition: template/plant_nutrition.md
       - Environmental Accounting Module: template/environmental_accounting_module.md
       - Biogas Module: template/biogas_module.md
    - Staff:
       - Development: staff/development.md
```
will be rendered on the website like the following:

![The navigation bars on the FarmDyn website](assets/website_nav.png)

As the example shows, all top level indents will be rendered under the **FarmDyn** tab (all vertical links, see FarmDyn, About, Introduction, etc.). A new tab, e.g. **The Template Model** (horizontal links), is introduced by `- The Template Model:` without specifying a file name afterwards. Now all sub-pages of the Template Model tab need to be on the next indentation level, as shown above.

It is good practice to store all markdown files belonging to a certain tab in a subfolder in the `docs` directory (see `template` or `staff` folders.)

### Building the website and publishing it online
If you're happy with the changes you made, you can directly publish the website online. In order to do so, just double click the `buildWebsite.cmd` file.

![The buildWebsite.cmd file will publish the documentation under [http://www.ilr.uni-bonn.de/em/rsrch/farmdyn/farmDynDoku/](http://www.ilr.uni-bonn.de/em/rsrch/farmdyn/farmDynDoku/)](assets/folder_overview_buildSite.png)

Obviously, this will only work if you have WRITE access to `\\agpserv2\ilrweb\em\rsrch\farmdyn\FarmDynDoku`.

### Building a PDF / Word document
In case you would like to create a printable (publishable) version of the documentation, just double-click the `createPDFFile.cmd` or respectively `createWordFile.cmd` file.

![These two cmd files will create either a printable PDF or Word Version of the documentation.](assets/folder_overview_doc.png)

The resulting documents can be found in the `print` folder once the conversion is done.

#### Changing the structure of the document
The structure of the print documents can be changed by adapting the `tableOfContents.txt` file in the `print` folder.

The following `tableOfContents.txt` file
![Overview of the tableOfContents.txt file](assets/tocFile.png)

will result in the following table of contents in a PDF
![Excerpt of the Table of Contents in the PDF](assets/tocPDF.png)

As you can see, each file path given in the `tableOfContents.txt` file will turn out to be a top-level heading in the Table of Contents, with the sub-level headings specified in those files.

You may notice a couple of things here: in the first line, a file called `print/frontMatter.yml` is referenced. This file will ONLY be used when a PDF file is created (not Word), and stores all information which will be displayed on the first page of the PDF (e.g. Title, Authors, Abstract ...).

Another thing of interest is the next line `docs/index_print.md`. Sometimes, it may be appropriate to have some information on the website that does not need to be in a printable version. In this case, the original `docs/index.md` file features an overview image of the FarmDyn results exploiter. In case we do not want the image to be in the printable version, we can create a copy of the `index.md` file and append the wording `_print` for future reference. In this file, we delete the reference to the image (or may do other alterations). By referencing this other file in the `tableOfContents.txt` file, we now have the chance of adapting the printable version to our needs, while mostly using the same ressources as the website.

### Updating code blocks
In the past, code blocks were simply copied into the documentation by hand. However, as the code frequently changes, this turned out to be cumbersome. We automated this process by using a little program called [embedmd](https://github.com/campoy/embedmd).

Unlike all other edits, the code blocks won't be updated automatically (neither with the live dev server nor the building of the website).
You can update all code blocks in the documentation by double-clicking the `reloadCodeSections.cmd` file.


![The reloadCodeSections.cmd file updates all code blocks in the documentation.](assets/folder_overview_code.png)

Further details on how to use the program are outlined in the [**Code blocks**](#codeblocks) section in the **Basic Markdown writing reference** outlined below.


## Basic Markdown writing reference
The most important reference for working with Markdown is the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
Also, many things will be self-explanatory when you look through the existing files.
In the following, I will copy (and add to) some of the things that are written in the cheatsheet.

### Headings
You can create a new heading by beginning a line with a `#` (or more depending on the level). Make sure to leave a blank line afterwards.

This markdown:
```
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6

```
Outputs:

# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

###### Heading level 6


### Emphasis
You can write in *italics* or **bold** by doing the following
```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
```
Outputs:
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

### Lists
(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```no-highlight
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

### Tables
Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and *Markdown Here* supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

```no-highlight
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
|:--------------|:-------------:|------:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
|:---------|:----------|:-----------|
| *Still*  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |
```

| 1        | 2         | 3          |


### Images
```no-highlight
Images can be placed just like links, but they have an ! at the beginning.

Inline-style:
![alt text](docs/media/image1.png ""Logo Title Text 1"")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: docs/media/image1.png ""Logo Title Text 2""
```

Inline-style:
![alt text](docs/media/image1.png ""Logo Title Text 1"")

### Code blocks
<a name=""codeblocks""></a>

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code on the other hand can be inserted as follows:

<pre lang=""no-highlight""><code>```GAMS
p_test = 2;
```
</code></pre>

which will result in:

```GAMS
p_test = 2;
```

When referencing code from the FarmDyn model, we use a small program that automatically pulls the code from the files. This way the documentation stays in sync with the latest model updates.

The syntax for pulling in the code blocks is as follows:

<pre lang=""no-highlight""><code>
[embedmd]:# (N:/path/to/gamsFile.gms GAMS /startingPoint/ /endPoint/)
</code></pre>

Where the startingPoint and endPoint need to be [regular expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference). Don't worry, you can copy the most common regular expressions that you will need down below.

Let's say we want to insert the `herdSize_` equation from the `general_herd_module.gms` file in our documentation. In order to do so, we would insert the following markdown

<pre lang=""no-highlight""><code>
[embedmd]:# (N:/agpo/work1/FarmDyn_QM/gams/model/general_herd_module.gms GAMS /herdSize_[\S\s][^;]*?\.\./ /;/)
</code></pre>

In plain English, this tells the program: Look through the general_herd_module.gms file, until you find a line that begins with 'herdSize_' and ends with '..', while ANYTHING may be in between the two. If you found this starting line, copy everything until the first semi-colon ';'.

Once you added such a markdown statement, make sure to double click the `reloadCodeSections.cmd` file as described above. The program will then pull in the code block and update all other ones.

#### Most common code blocks
Keep in mind that the regular expression will always return the FIRST entry it found in the file. That said, your regular expression needs to be precise enough that it is matched only once in the file. Otherwise a code block will be pulled in which you did not want to see at the desired position. In that case, just delete it and try again! It is sometimes even helpful to copy the content of the file to [regex101](https://regex101.com/) and try your regular expression there.

##### A whole function

<pre lang=""no-highlight""><code>
[embedmd]:# (N:/path/to/gamsFile.gms GAMS /EquationName_[\S\s][^;]*?\.\./ /;/)
</code></pre>

##### Parameter value assignment

<pre lang=""no-highlight""><code>
[embedmd]:# (N:/path/to/gamsFile.gms GAMS /p_someParam(""domain1"",""domain2"",domain3)  = 1/ /;/)
</code></pre>

##### Sets or Tables
<pre lang=""no-highlight""><code>
[embedmd]:# (N:/path/to/gamsFile.gms GAMS /set setName/ /;/)
[embedmd]:# (N:/path/to/gamsFile.gms GAMS /table tableName/ /;/)
</code></pre>

### Footnotes

#### Inserting the reference
The footnote reference is enclosed in square brackets and starts with a caret, followed by an arbitrary label which may contain numeric identifiers [1, 2, 3, ...] or names [Granovetter et al. 1998]. The rendered references are always consecutive superscripted numbers.

Example:

```md
Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2]
```

Result:

Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2]

#### Inserting the content
The footnote content is also declared with a label, which must match the label used for the footnote reference. It can be inserted at an arbitrary position in the document and is always rendered at the bottom of the page. Furthermore, a backlink is automatically added to the footnote reference.

**on a single line¶**
Short statements can be written on the same line.

Example:

```md
[^1]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

Result:
See at the bottom of the page
[^1]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.


**on multiple lines**
Paragraphs should be written on the next line. As with all Markdown blocks, the content must be indented by four spaces.

Example:

```md
[^2]:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod
    nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor
    massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.
```

Result:
see at the bottom of the page
[^2]:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod
    nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor
    massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.

### Equations
Typesetting equations in Markdown is done using the powerful LaTeX notation. Already know LaTeX? Then directly go to Step 2. If not, no worries, just keep on reading.

1) A lot of Visual Equation Editors are available online. A really simple, but powerful one is [Gruppy](https://guppy.js.org/site/). Just type your equation in the ""Click to start typing math!"" field and once done, copy the LaTeX output which is shown below.

2) In the Markdown file, inline math is written by using single dollar signs:

```md
this will be some inline math $2+2=4$ and it will look really pretty
```

outputs:

this will be some inline math $2+2=4$ and it will look really pretty

Equation blocks (on a new line and centered), will be surrounded by two dollars:

```md
this will be a block equation

$$2+2=4$$

and it will look really pretty
```
outputs:

this will be a block equation

$$2+2=4$$

and it will look really pretty


### Admonition blocks
Admonition is an extension included in the standard Markdown library that makes it possible to add block-styled side content to your documentation, for example summaries, notes, hints or warnings.

Admonition blocks follow a simple syntax: every block is started with !!!, followed by a single keyword which is used as the type qualifier of the block. The content of the block then follows on the next line, indented by four spaces.

```md
!!! note
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod
    nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor
    massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa.
```

will result in

![An admonition block](assets/admonition.png)

Beware that these blocks won't appear in the printable documents (at least at the time of writing).

You can read more about how to set up admonition blocks [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/extensions/admonition/).

This is a ROS package for the CMP9767M course of Lincoln University. The focus area that we have chosen is **navigation**. The aim os this work is to develop a robot that can autonomously navigate between obstacles (both static and dynamic), identify different kinds of weeds and then spray at them in the Gazebo simulation environment. To achieve a precise localization we have used **amcl**, and with the help of **move_base** we can freely navigate in our map by using the action client-server interface. We identify the different types of weeds using contours and compute their final position in the ""map"" frame by correcting it, using the camera's intrinsic parameters. To spray the weeds we call a service that only considers the last 500 detected weeds to reduce computations.

### Prerequisites

To use this package you need to have: 
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* OpenCV 4.5.1
* ROS Melodic

### Setup

To use our package you first have to install the L-CAS Ubuntu/ROS software distribution. To do so, do:
1. ```sudo ls``` (this is just to cache you admin password for the next steps)
2. ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl``` (curl is required for the next step)
3. ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LCAS/rosdistro/master/lcas-rosdistro-setup.sh | bash -``` (should install everything required)

Then clone the main CMP9767M package, and our package in your catkin workspace:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/harismats/CMP9767M
git clone https://github.com/harismats/weeding_bot_CMP9767M
cd ..
catkin_make
```

After you are done with that with no erros, do:
```
pip install scipy==1.2.0
```

In case any other package is missing, you can install it with:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-<package_name>
```

### How to run

To run our system, do the followings in different terminals in this sequence:
1. ```roscore```
2. ```roslaunch weeding_bot our_sim.launch``` (wait for the whole simulation to load before running the next step's command)
3. ```roslaunch weeding_bot system_nodes.launch```

Provide a farm pattern capable of adjusting its parallelism degree based on whether the system is performing worse or better
than a given service time. Hence, the pattern aims at achieving (consistently) the service time taken as input.
The pattern is tested providing a collection of tasks such that the tasks in the initial, central and
final part all require a different average time to be computed (e.g. 4L in the first part, L in the second part
and 8L in the third part) and the task collection execution time is considerably longer than the time needed
to reconfigure the farm.

I created this project during my Bsc. Computer Science Final Year(2019-2020) program. Submitted as a final year project.


Caution: Many folders and files are not uploaded,above. Only some folders are uploaded. So download the above folder for reference.As the project will not work.

Hello!

The project was created using php, javascript, mysql. Xampp was used to host this project . Why xampp? XAMPP is an abbreviation for cross-platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP and Perl, and it allows you to build site offline, on a local web server on your computer.

Description:

    The project was created with an intention that if a farmer wants to sell their farm produce like fruits, vegetables , seeds or diary products like milk, etc or if they want, they can sell them online using this website, also provide information like nutritious value and stuff related to the products easily using this website.
    The customer just have to register and login themselves and can buy any product easily, online. They can view the blogs , gain information and buy products if they want. 
    
Components:

1.Index file.(Home page)
2.Login/Register
3.Product and service Categories like (vegetables, Milk, Fruits, Seeds, and additional option of rooms available.). 
4.The admin(Farmer) can describe the product , put up images about the product, quanity,etc.
5.Dashboard: To view total sales,sales for current day, number of products, number of users. The admin can add new users, categories and product.
6.View Cart for customers
7.Check-out online.



To run the project:
1. Install xampp/wampp , but for this project I used xampp and for xampp, after installation start xampp-control panel and start 2 buttons apache and mysql.
2. Go to phpmyadmin(or click on the admin section in front of apache of xampp control panel ) and open phpmyadmin page .
3. When phpmyadmin server page is opened, click on new tab, write the database name(if you have a sql file(farm.sql like this format) write that name eg. farm)and select create button.
4. After that import the sql file / create the desired tables.
5. Make project/ unzip the project/ copy paste the whole project inside the xampp>htdocs folder and paste your folder e.g for me , my location was C:\xampp\htdocs\farm 
6. To run project make sure the folder path is correct ,your xampp-control panel is open and both the actions in front of Apache and mysql and started. IF working properly green colour will be highlighted in both of their names.
7. After everything is done. Write eg. localhost/farm or whatever your filename is and run the file in the browser.(any browser).
8. If any error occurs .. Very common.. Mysql error. Now this might occur if you have password set for mysql and while creating project you have not passed the correct mysql password, or sometimes because of mysql's presence your xampp might not work, so check thoroughly (errors) and copy paste them and google properly.

P.S i did this project earlier and used the older version of xampp, so version difference error might occur.

DIY Erdbeerfarm auf dem Dach einer Fertiggarage

Hier entsteht eine Beschreibung für mein Projekt ""Erdbeerfarm auf dem Garagendach""

## Motivation
Ich besitze ein Reihenhaus im Osten von Bremen. Da das Grundstück relativ klein ist, und ich nicht viel Platz für 'Nutzpflanzen' habe, kam mir die Idee den Platz auf dem Garagendach doch auch zu nutzen. Die Grundidee entsprang einer Bierlaune, doch inzwischen wirft die kleine Farm gute Erträge ab, und ich plane schon den Ausbau. 

## Version 0.2 - aktuelle Version

Die Version 0.2 besteht aus 8 Blumenkästen. Die Bewässerung erfolgt über einen 210 Liter Tank in der Garage mit einer Tauchpumpe. Die Steuerung der Pumpe wird mit einem Shelly Plug S realisiert. 


* [Materialliste für Version 0.2](vers_0.2/bom.md)
* [Beschreibung](vers_0.2/beschreibung.md)

## Version 0.1
Die Version 0.1 bestand aus 4 Blumenkästen mit integriertem Wasservorratsbehälter. Die Blumenkästen enthielten jeweils 3 Erdbeerpflanzen. Automatisiert war hier noch nichts. Ich musste immer mit einer Trittleiter auf die Garage klettern und die Blumenkästen von Hand bewässern.

Since it is my first game, it was bound to be coded horribly from the very start. However, it works, and that's all that mattered back in the Jefferson Years.","# Farming In The Jefferson Years

I created this game in 2018, during the time that I was in AP Programming A, a time before my teacher taught me what a ""class"" or ""array"" was. My US History teacher created this game to show how much of a gamble farming used to be during the Westward Expansion, and I decided to port it to Java in one day, over nine long hours. This game is a simple one. Just buy some livestock or seeds and hope that you can make a profit by selling your items at the end of the year after prices have fluctuated. However, unlike in a stock market simulator where prices fluctuate for everyone, the prices that you, the farmer, must pay to buy livestock and seeds each year are fixed. I wish you good luck, farmer, for you are going to need it.

C.R.O.P.S. : CRoissance Optimale des Plantes en Sol. Gestion des capteurs et stockage dans CouchDB

## C'est Quoi?
Colecte des donnees environementales pour unbe croissance optimale des plantes
et stockage de ces donnees dans une base de donmnee de type couchDB

Le systeme est base sur les capteurs suivants:
 - Le capteur DHT22 permet la mesure de la temperature ambiante
   ainsi que du niveau d'humiditee ambiante
 - Le capteur CSMS V1.2 permet la mesure de la quantitee d'eau dans le sol.
   CSMS: 'Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor'
 - Le captteur BMP085 permet la mesure de la pression et de la temperature
   (de maniere semblet'il plus precise aue le DHT mais je ne l'ai pas encore verifie)
 - Le capteur TSL2561 Permet de mesurer la lumiere recue par les plantes
 
 le tout controle par un microcontroleur de type ESP32 avec wifi integre le ""LoLin d32-Pro"" et utilisant un afichage e-Paper LOLIN_IL3897.
 
 - main.cpp       : Contiens le code a flasher sur l'EPS32 et qui vas collecter les donnees
 - cropsDB.ipyndb : Contiens le notebook Jupyter permetant de visualiser et d'analyser les donnees
 
## Pour quoi ?
Il y as deux idees deriere ce developement:
- Tester differents capteurs pour une agriculture plus digitale et voir ce que l'on peux tirer de l'analyse des donnees mais tout de meme a bas cout et partager avec tous les moyens de le metre en oeuvre (l'ensemble du systeme de captation des donnees coute moins de 50$)
- L'autre question est est'il possible de produire en appartement avec eclairage artificiel tout en emetant autant voire moins de CO2 que des produits issus du suipermarche.

Ce Developement c'est effectue au Fablab Artilect https://artilect.fr/ et as ete presente pour la premiere fois durant le Fablab Festival 2019 https://fablabfestival.artilect.fr/
 
## Coment l'installer?

### Instalation de la partie capture des donnees
pour pouvoir fonctioner il vous faudra soit avoir un acces a CouchDB soit instale sur votre ordinateur soit une en ligne de style CloudAnt dont la version Lite (Gratuite) devrais etre sufisante: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant) 

le code main.cpp est prevu pour etre utilise avec PlatformIO sur atom
* Il vous faudra installer Atom: https://atom.io/
* Ensuite platformIO: dans Atom aller dans settings > Pakages > et instaler ""platformio-ide""
* Dans platformIO Home, aller dan libraries et instalez les libraries suivantes:
  * Adafruit BMP085 
  * Adafruit GFX
  * Adafruit Unified Sensor
  * Adafruit TSL2561
  * ArduinoJson (Par Benoit Blanchon)
  * DHTesp (Par Bernd Giesecke)
  * NTPClient (Par Fabrice Weinberg)
  * TimeLib (Par Paul Stoffregen)
  * La librarie LOLIN_EPD (Par Wemos) est aussi necessaire mais n'est pas disponible en installation automatique il faudra aller la chercher ici: https://github.com/wemos/LOLIN_EPD_Library et copier le repository dans le repertoire lib de votre projet.
* Modifier le main.cpp afin dy introduire vos parametres WiFi et CouchDB dans les definitions

Remote control and timer for sprinkler system.
The pumpcontroller for the sprinkler system is a DAB ESC 4 T, which has a s/w connection for turning on and off the pump which I will be switching with a relais connected to a Raspberry Pi.

## The concept
### Remote
Because it is hard to find the correct spot for the sprinkler at once, the farmer spends a lot of time walking back and forth between the sprinkler and the pump controller. Being able to switch the pump remotely can save lots of time and miles.

### Timer
Waiting for the moment to switch off the pump isn't exactly time well spent, with this program the farmer is able to set a timer to two pre-defined times remotely and go home.

## Hardware
- 4 channel 433Mhz RF remote with receiver
- Raspberry Pi B+ (yeah, the oldie)
- 5V relais 1-channel high-active
- Green and red buttons with switchable LED
- 2 x 16 LCD with I2C backpack
- KEYES040 rotary encoder

### Schematics
![schematics, also available in gpio configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/53645714n/rainmaker/master/Rainmaker.png ""Schematics"")

## Raspberry Pi
### Enable I2C
For the I2C backpackfor the lcd screen we need to enable I2C. Type:
```
sudo raspi-config
```

In the menu, select '5 Interfacing options' and then 'P5 I2C'. Choose Yes when asked: 'Would you like the ARM I2C interface to be enabled?'

### Setup HW-clock
Follow this guide: https://trick77.com/adding-ds3231-real-time-clock-raspberry-pi-3/
Use sudo a bit more often (everywhere) and reboot between step #3 and #4.

### Software
Install python and git if you haven't already and then clone the repository and install the dependencies.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/53645714n/rainmaker.git
pip install -r rainmaker/requirements.txt
```

### Setup
If you wired everything exactly like I did, skip this and go to run the program.
```
nano rainmaker/rainmaker.py
```

### Run the program
```
python3 rainmaker/rainmaker.py #this will start the script
tail -f rainmaker.log #this will show you what it's doing.
```
Type 'kill -9 [PROCESS]'  to kill the script where [PROCESS] is the number returned after the python3 command.

### Auto start
Move the systemd service file I created to the systemd folder and change it's permissions by doing the following.
```
sudo mv rainmaker/rainmaker.service /lib/systemd/system/rainmaker.service
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/rainmaker.service
```
After this, reload the daemon and enable the service
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable rainmaker.service
```
Reboot and check the service:
```
sudo systemctl status rainmaker.service
```

## Manual
The program will start at boot and log any events to rainmaker.log in the home folder.

### Buttons
The green and A buttons turn on the pump indefinately
The red and B buttons turn off the pump and interrupt any timer set
The C and D buttons set a timer for a set time (standard 60 and 120 minutes)
Pushing the rotary encoder opens the timer menu, the first time you enter is the start time, the second time (after pushing again) is the end-time. Pushing a third time starts the timer. Witht the red button you can exit the menu any time and interrupt the timer.

### LED's
| Green | Red | *Function* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On | Off | Pump is off |
| Off | On | Error occured, view logging |
| Blinking | On | Pump is on indefinately |
| Blinking | Blinking | The timer is enabled |
| Off | Blinking 0.2 seconds | In timer menu, push to exit |

The US pork integrated industry includes pig farmers, transportation companies, hog processing plants, distributors, and retailers.
The Hog processing plants around the country got affected during the early months of the Covid-19 Pandemic due to Covid-19 outbreaks inside the plants that led to a reduction in pig processing capacity of about 45% (Marchant-Forde and Boyle 2020).
The reduction of hog processing capacity at the plant level caused a backlog of ready pigs to market around the country swine’s farm sector.
The pig inventories sudden increase caused reduced hog prices and a disruption of normal livestock production.
This study focuses on the disruption of the swine producers by the Covid-19 Pandemic at the Hog Farming level due to the closure of Hog Processing Plants down the supply chain. The study investigates how contract farming, the farm’s marketing plan, the farm’s size, and the type helped to manage the risk associated with the closure of the Hog Processing Plants. To develop this study, we used the farm classification developed by USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) which classifies USA’s Farms (EIBN, 2018).

**Hypothesis (H1)**: The reduction of hog processing capacity negatively impacted the implementation of the swine farm’s daily standard operating procedures (SOPs).

**Hypothesis (H2)**: A swine farming operation under a production contract was positively associated with a better emergency plan to reestablish business continuity and daily standard operating procedures (SOPs) at the swine farm.

**Hypothesis (H3)**: A team of swine nutritionists and veterinary resources helped to manage the oversupply of ready pigs to market at the swine farming operation under a production contract.

This study uses data from swine farmers around the country. The data collection's main goal was to explore the factors that caused the disruption of the swine producers by the Covid-19 Pandemic at the Hog Farming level.

The questionnaire intends to collect the following information: (1) farm’s demographic data; (2) data on production, operation, and the number of hogs harvest per day, (3) monthly farm’s operational mode during 2020; (4) farm’s operational contract type; (5) data on each farmer’s knowledge on swine diet adjustment to reduce growth and farmer’s participation in the webinar by the swine’s industry to manage diets during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Testing the Hypotheses

The case study used a [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/995CQV3) of 10 questions. The [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/995CQV3) was posted using the surveymonkey.com website platform. The [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/995CQV3) was sent to a total of 46 individual farms within the United States. In addition, the [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/995CQV3) was posted to 11 Facebook Groups with a total of 64,800 members as per Facebook-provided data. The [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/995CQV3) questions were collected between April and May 2021. The online [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/995CQV3) can be accessed [here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/995CQV3). The ten survey questions and variable combinations can be seen below, See Table 1.

![My Image](BAN-701-Table1-R.jpg)

Due to limited time and a lack of networking within the swine industry. The sample size is only 13 participants. However, the survey was able to help us to collect important information that compares to data available through the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) which classifies USA’s Farms (EIBN, 2018).

As an example, the survey was able to identify that 62% of the people who answered the survey were from Small to Midsize Family farms, See Table 2. This quantity is mirroring the distribution of farms by the value of products shown on the USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) (EIBN, 2018).

![My Image](BAN-701-Table2-R.jpg)

According to our data analysis, we were able to accept all of the following hypotheses:

The Hypothesis (H1) was accepted as the p-value of 1.315e-05 is less than the 0.10 needed for a confidence interval of 90%. The code used to calculate Hypothesis (H1) values can be found here: [Mod_13_Part2_Analysis_Hypothesis_H1](Code/Mod_13_Part_2_Analysis_Hypothesis_H1.R)

In addition, as you can see in Table 3, the Oversupply variable results show that farmers agree that a variation in the number of harvest hogs lead to an increase in the inventory level during the first half of 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, (Marchant & Boyle 2020).

![My Image](BAN-701-Table3-R.jpg)

As per Table 3, a total of 14 participants, or 36% of the participants agreed that disruption on the normal levels of hogs occurred during the first half of 2020.

The Hypothesis (H2) was accepted as the p-value of 2.169e-06 is less than the 0.10 needed for a confidence interval of 90%. The code used to calculate Hypothesis (H2) values can be found here: [Mod_13_Part2_Analysis_Hypothesis_H2](Code/Mod_13_Part_2_Analysis_Hypothesis_H2.R)

The Hypothesis (H3) was accepted as the p-value of 1.028e-05 is less than the 0.10 needed for a confidence interval of 90%. The code used to calculate Hypothesis (H3) values can be found here: [Mod_13_Part2_Analysis_Hypothesis_H3](Code/Mod_13_Part_2_Analysis_Hypothesis_H3.R)

As you can see in Table 4 below, a higher percentage of participants agreed that the Hog diet played an important role in their inventory management during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, (Freese, 2020) & (Ep13-Pipestone, 2020).

This is the repository for my second year Operating Systems Lab project. I was required to give an implementation of the farm pattern in c.

The project is made up of two processes: the masterworker and the collector. The masterworker is a multithreaded entity responsible for setting up an AF_UNIX socket connection (i.e. acting as a server), for asynchronous signal handling and for distributing tasks among its worker threads. Whilst the collector is a process forked by the masterworker and its job is to connect to the socket (i.e. acting as a client), to gather the results sent by each worker via socket connection and to print the results.

Inter-process communication is achieved via the use of a stream socket of the AF_UNIX family, as mentioned before, and via an unnamed pipe. They, respectively, handle the transmission of results from the worker threads to the collector process and the delivery of signals from the masterworker's signal handler thread to the collector.

The workers are created from within the master thread and put into a pool. Communication between the master and the worker threads is achieved by using a concurrent structure storing filepaths representing tasks: the bounded buffer. The master puts tasks into the buffer and each worker removes one task from it at a time. Each worker then proceeds to open the file located at the path represented by the task, performs a simple computation on its contents and sends the result to the collector.

Input validation and error checking is performed throughout and a rudimental system for tracing is employed. Additionally, some data structures written specifically for the project are unit-tested for correctness.

For more information, please build the program (see section below) and run the command `farm -h`. 

Feel also free to have a look at the Makefile and the source files.

## possible usages: 
* `make (all)` -> builds the executables
* `make test` -> executes the test.sh script
* `make test1` -> executes the default configuration in verbose mode with valgrind
* `make test2` -> same as above but a configuration file is passed as an argument
* `make test3` -> executes ./farm -n 2 -q 4 -t 2000 test/*.dat -d test -v
* `make test4` -> executes the signals.sh script
* `make sample_report` -> same as test1, but saves the stderr and stdout in ""./logs/report.log""
* `make error[1,2]` -> tests some configuration files that may generate errors
* `make error3` -> tests some user inputs that may generate errors
* `make clean(all)` -> gets rid of all files created with the previous commands

A tool for meadow care, e.g. it can be pulled across a field after manure has been spread if it is still too clumsy. The better it is distributed, the more plants benefit from the muck, and the less likely it is to mow into possible chunks later.

It also serves to spread earth hills created by mice (also - questionably - easing the life of those as they have an easier time getting material out).

=======================================

In 2005 I was a young lad. I'd self-taught myself a few programming languages including BASIC, Delphi and DIV. It was at this time I decided to try out web development.

As it turns out, the whole web thing caught on, and I somehow made a career out of it.

**The TIBZ Farm** is the first project that I ever wrote for the web. I've  decided to tweak the code and open-source it for its 12 year anniversary.

In a nutshell
-------------

The project started life as the simplest interactive website I could imagine: a single input field that would put your input into the database and regurgitate it back to other users.

This sounded too bland. Flashing colours and wobbling words were added. The rest is history.

What is a TIBZ and why does it live on a farm?
----------------------------------------------

The project was originally called ""The AutoTIBZ"". Tibz was an in-joke with some guys at school, with whom I'm still great friends with to this day. None of us can explain what it really means, just that it sounded funny at the time. The ""farm"" is just the most random domain I could register in 2015 when I did a bit of spring cleaning of my servers.

NSFW; terrible, horrific content
--------------------------------

The internet of 2005 caught on to this site. Like any site that allows anonymous content, it has not been used for many pleasantries. Currently there is no censorship, and all user contributed content is **horrific, disgusting, racist, perverted, sick**, beautiful art. It's wonderful to think that my code has contributed such commentary to the internet for over a decade.

Sub-projects
------------

For fun and to flex my web developer muscles, I'm going to do the following sub-projects with The TIBZ Farm, whenever I get time:

+ [x] Update the code and open-source it
+ [ ] Package the project as an app for mobile devices
+ [ ] Create a Twitter bot
+ [ ] NSFWipsum dummy text generator

Users can also claim the rewards generated during staking.,"# Simple DeFi Yield Farming Exercise

Cómo usar Granjas (Yield Farming) en PancakeSwap
https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/yield-farming/how-to-use-farms

### Caso de uso

En este ejercicio, implementarás un proyecto DeFi Simple Token Farm.

La Granja permite al usuario hacer depósitos y retiros de un Token LP simulado.
Los usuarios también pueden reclamar las recompensas generadas durante el staking. Estos tokens de recompensa son el token de la plataforma: nombre: ""Token DApp"", token ""DAPP"".

El caso de uso del contrato Simple Token Farm es el siguiente:

- Los usuarios depositan Tokens LP `deposit()`
- El usuario puede cosechar o reclamar recompensas `claimRewards()`
- El usuario puede retirar (unstake) todos sus Tokens LP `withdraw()` pero aún reclamar recompensas pendientes
- Cada vez que se actualiza la cantidad de tokens LP apostados, primero se deben recalcular las recompensas
- El propietario de la plataforma puede llamar al método `distributeRewardsAll()` regularmente para actualizar las recompensas pendientes de todos los usuarios que están apostando (staking).

### Contratos

- LPToken.sol: Contrato de token LP, utilizado para staking.
- DappToken.sol: Contrato de token de la plataforma, utilizado como recompensa.
- TokenFarm.sol: El contrato de la Granja.

## Requerimientos

1. Crea un nuevo proyecto _Hardhat_, agrega el contrato proporcionado
2. Implementa todas las funciones, eventos y todo lo mencionado en los comentarios del código en el contrato
3. Despliega los contratos en un entorno local

### Bonus: 1 Modifier

Crea funciones `modifier()` que validen: 1. si el llamante de la función es un usuario que está apostando 2. si el llamante de la función es el propietario del contrato
Añade el modificador en las funciones que lo requieran.

### Bonus: 2 Struct

Crea una `Struct{}` que contenga la información de staking del usuario y reemplace los siguientes `mapping()`

```
mapping(address => uint256) public stakingBalance;
mapping(address => uint256) public checkpoints;
mapping(address => uint256) public pendigRewards;
mapping(address => bool) public hasStaked;
mapping(address => bool) public isStaking;
```

Por un nuevo `mapping()` de `(address => structUser)`.
Modifica las funciones correspondientes de acuerdo a este nuevo `mapping()`.

### Bonus: 3 Tests

Crea un archivo de tests para el contrato SimpleBank que te permita probar:

1. Acuñar Tokens LP para un usuario y hacer un depósito de esos tokens
2. La plataforma distribuye correctamente las recompensas a todos los usuarios que están apostando
3. El usuario reclama recompensas y verifica si se transfirieron exitosamente a su cuenta
4. El usuario des-apuesta todos los tokens LP depositados y reclama recompensas pendientes, si las hay

### Bonus: 4 Recompensas variables por bloque

1. Transforma las recompensas por bloque en un rango, permite al propietario cambiar ese valor.

### Bonus: 5 Tarifa de retiro ( Withdrawal fee)

1. Cobra una tarifa al momento de reclamar las recompensas.

# The Community of Contributors: How it Works

### About

[OpenFarm](http://openfarm.cc) is a free and open database and web application for farming and gardening knowledge. One might think of it as the Wikipedia for growing plants, though it functions more like a cooking recipes site.

The main content are Growing Guides: creative, crowd-sourced, single-author, structured documents that include all of the necessary information for a person or machine to grow a plant, i.e.: seed spacing and depth, watering regimen, recommended soil composition and companion plants, sun/shade requirements, etc. In this Freebase platform, gardeners can find answers to questions like &ldquo;How do I grow tomatoes?&rdquo;

### Start by Joining Existing Contributors

To start the discussion, get involved, and meet OpenFarm core community of contributors, we strongly recommend joining [our Slack room](http://slack.openfarm.cc/)! This is where you'll find the latest conversation about Openfarm and the most active contributors.

Check also the [FAQ](http://openfarm.cc/pages/faq) for some frequently asked questions about contributing (Angular, Issue Trackers, IRC Channels).

Check the [ongoing issues](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/projects) that need work on in the priority list.

### Look for Something You Want to Work On

For [front-end](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/projects/1) and [back-end](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/projects/3) code contributions, we aim at maintaining and prioritizing the Github issues through Github Projects, the Trello-like web-based project management board of Github: [OpenFarm Projects](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/projects).

## Development

### Getting Started (The Easy Way)

You should use Vagrant to get the OpenFarm system running on your computer. It will avoid having to install the things listed in The Hard Way below.

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/).
2. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
3. Open your terminal.
4. `$ git clone https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm.git` - this tells your computer to fetch the data stored in this repository using git.
5. `$ cd OpenFarm` - change to the OpenFarm directory.
6. `$ vagrant up` This will take a long time. We're downloading a whole bunch of stuff. Go make yourself a pot of coffee, or brew some tea. If something goes wrong at this point, reach out to us directly via GitHub issue.

#### Accessing Vagrant

Once Vagrant is set up on your system, you might want to actually access it. For example, if you want to start up the server (though vagrant up should run `rails s` for you):

8. `$ vagrant ssh` - this makes you access the new virtual server we just created to run OpenFarm on.
9. `cd /vagrant` - the `vagrant` directory is mirrored in your own computer. If you add a file there, you'll see it appear here.
10. `rails s` - actually run the Rails server!
11. you should now be able to access OpenFarm on your local system at http://localhost:3000. If all went well, you will have a seeded database and can use the account `admin@admin.com` with password `admin123`.

The above is still being patched, so please reach out to us if something went wrong!

### Getting Started (The Hard Way)

You will need to install [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) [v6.5.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.5/release-notes-6.5.0.html), and [Mongodb](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/) before you can get an OpenFarm server up and running on your local machine. Once you have these prerequisites to get started with a local copy of the project, run:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm.git
$ cd OpenFarm
$ bundle install
$ rake db:setup
$ echo ""ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE'] = '$(rake secret)'"" >> config/app_environment_variables.rb
$ echo ""ENV['GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY'] = ''"" >> config/app_environment_variables.rb # or get an actual API key at https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE&reusekey=true&pli=1
$ rails s
```

Then, visit [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) in your browser to see the OpenFarm web application running on your local machine. If all went well, you will have a seeded database and can use the account `admin@admin.com` with password `admin123`.

**Note about ElasticSearch**: Some Linux users have noted issues installing ElasticSearch onto a host machine. One workaround is to install ElasticSearch via Docker:

```
sudo docker pull elasticsearch:6.5.0
sudo docker pull mongo
```

```
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144 # <= Some linux users must run this
sudo docker run -p 9300:9300 -p 9200:9200 elasticsearch:6.5.0
sudo docker run -p 27017:27017 mongo

```


**If you had any problem** installing bundles getting up and running etc see the [Common Issues Page](https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm/wiki/Common-Issues).

Remember that `/vagrant` folder in the Vagrant VM is largely for convenience, and working in it can cause unexpected behavior with other tools - you should do your work in your own non-vagrant environment. Use the environment you're most familiar with to program, and Vagrant will do the rest.


#### Become a Core Contributor

If you've made two PRs, we'll add you as a core contributor.

For core-code contributors, here are a few basic ground-rules:

* No --force pushes or modifying the Git history in any way.
* Non-master branches ought to be used for ongoing work.
* External API changes and significant modifications ought to be subject to an internal pull-request to solicit feedback from other contributors.
* Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are encouraged for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
* Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.

This application allows you to AFK mine timed Twitch drops, without having to worry about switching channels when the one you were watching goes offline, claiming the drops, or even receiving the stream data itself. This helps both you and Twitch save on bandwidth and hassle. Everyone wins!

### How It Works:

Every ~60 seconds, the application sends a ""minute watched"" event to the channel that's currently being watched - this is enough to advance the drops. Note that this completely bypasses the need to download any actual stream video and sound. To keep the status (ONLINE or OFFLINE) of the channels up-to-date, there's a websocket connection established that receives events about streams going up or down, or updates regarding the current amount of viewers.

### Features:

- Stream-less drop mining - save on bandwidth.
- Game priority and exclusion lists, allowing you to focus on mining what you want, in the order you want, and ignore what you don't want.
- Sharded websocket connection, allowing for tracking up to `8*25-2=199` channels at the same time.
- Automatic drop campaigns discovery based on linked accounts (requires you to do [account linking](https://www.twitch.tv/drops/campaigns) yourself though)
- Stream tags and drop campaign validation, to ensure you won't end up mining a stream that can't earn you the drop.
- Automatic channel stream switching, when the one you were currently watching goes offline, as well as when a channel streaming a higher priority game goes online.
- Login session is saved in a cookies file, so you don't need to login every time.
- Mining is automatically started as new campaigns appear, and stopped when the last available drops have been mined.

### Usage:

- Download and unzip [the latest release](https://github.com/DevilXD/TwitchDropsMiner/releases) - it's recommended to keep it in the folder it comes in.
- Run it and login into your Twitch account using your username and password, and a 2FA key if you have one setup. It's recommended to avoid having to double-take this step, as you can run into CAPTCHA that will prevent you from trying to log in again for the next 12+ hours. You can retry afterwards though.
- After a successful login, the app should fetch a list of all available campaigns and games you can mine drops for - you can then select and add games of choice to the Priority List available on the Settings tab, and then press on the `Reload` button to start processing. It will fetch a list of all applicable streams it can watch, and start mining right away. You can also manually switch to a different channel as needed.
- Make sure to link your Twitch account to game accounts on the [campaigns page](https://www.twitch.tv/drops/campaigns), to enable more games to be mined.
- Persistent cookies will be stored in the `cookies.jar` file, from which the authorization (login) information will be restored on each subsequent run.

### Notes:

- Make sure to keep your cookies file safe, as the authorization information it stores can give another person access to your Twitch account.
- Successfully logging into your Twitch account in the application, may cause Twitch to send you a ""New Login"" notification email. This is normal - you can verify that it comes from your own IP address. The application uses the Twitch's SmartTV account linking process, so the detected browser during the login should signify that as well.
- The time remaining timer always countdowns a single minute and then stops - it is then restarted only after the application redetermines the remaining time. This ""redetermination"" can happen as early as at 10 seconds in a minute remaining, and as late as 20 seconds after the timer reaches zero (especially when finishing mining a drop), but is generally only an approximation and does not represent nor affect actual mining speed. The time variations are due to Twitch sometimes not reporting drop progress at all, or reporting progress for the wrong drop - these cases have all been accounted for in the application though.

### Notes about the Windows build:

- To achieve a portable-executable format, the application is packaged with PyInstaller into an `EXE`. Some non-mainstream antivirus engines might report the packaged executable as a trojan, because PyInstaller has been used by others to package malicious Python code in the past. These reports can be safely ignored. If you absolutely do not trust the executable, you'll have to install Python yourself and run everything from source.
- The executable uses the `%TEMP%` directory for temporary runtime storage of files, that don't need to be exposed to the user (like compiled code and translation files). For persistent storage, the directory the executable resides in is used instead.
- The autostart feature is implemented as a registry entry to the current user's (`HKCU`) autostart key. It is only altered when toggling the respective option. If you relocate the app to a different directory, the autostart feature will stop working, until you toggle the option off and back on again

### Notes about the Linux build:

- The Linux app is built and distributed in a portable-executable format (similar to [AppImages](https://appimage.org/)).
- The Linux app should work out of the box on any modern distribution (as long as it has `glibc>=2.31` and a working display server).
- Every feature of the app is expected to work on Linux just as well as it does on Windows. If you find something that's broken, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/DevilXD/TwitchDropsMiner/issues/new).
- The size of the Linux app is significantly larger than the Windows app due to the inclusion of the `gtk3` library (and its dependencies), which is required for proper system tray/notifications support.
- As an alternative to the native Linux app, you can run the Windows app via [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) instead. It works really well!

### Project goals:

Twitch Drops Miner (TDM for short) has been designed with a couple of simple goals in mind. These are, specifically:

- Twitch Drops oriented - it's in the name. That's what I made it for.
- Easy to use for an average person. Includes a nice looking GUI and is packaged as a ready-to-go executable, without requiring an existing Python installation to work.
- Intended as a helper tool that starts together with your PC, runs in the background through out the day, and then closes together with your PC shutting down at the end of the day. If it can run continuously for 24 hours at minimum, and not run into any errors, I'd call that good enough already.
- Requiring a minimum amount of attention during operation - check it once or twice through out the day to see if everything's fine with it.
- Underlying service friendly - the amount of interactions done with the Twitch site is kept to the minimum required for reliable operation, at a level achievable by a diligent site user.

TDM is not intended for/as:

- Mining channel points - again, it's about the drops: only. The current points you're getting are a byproduct of getting the drops, not the main goal of it.
- Mining anything else besides Twitch drops - no, I won't be adding support for a random 3rd party site that also happens to rely on watching Twitch streams.
- Unattended operation: worst case scenario, it'll stop working and you'll hopefully notice that at some point. Hopefully.
- 100% uptime application, due to the underlying nature of it, expect fatal errors to happen every so often.
- Being hosted on a remote server as a 24/7 miner.
- Being used with more than one managed account.
- Mining campaigns the managed account isn't linked to.

This means that features such as:

- It being possible to run it without a GUI, or with only a console attached.
- Any form of automatic restart when an error happens.
- Docker or any other form of remote deployment.
- Using it with more than one managed account.
- Making it possible to mine campaigns that the managed account isn't linked to.
- Anything that increases the site processing load caused by the application.
- Any form of additional notifications system (email, webhook, etc.), beyond what's already implemented.

..., are most likely not going to be a feature, ever. You're welcome to search through the existing issues to comment on your point of view on the relevant matters, where applicable. Otherwise, most of the new issues that go against these goals will be closed and the user will be pointed to this paragraph.

For more context about these goals, please check out these issues: [#161](https://github.com/DevilXD/TwitchDropsMiner/issues/161), [#105](https://github.com/DevilXD/TwitchDropsMiner/issues/105), [#84](https://github.com/DevilXD/TwitchDropsMiner/issues/84)

## Get started

<br>

### Instalation


```sh
pip install defi
```

<br>

### Impermanent Loss

```python
import defi.defi_tools as dft

# Impermanent loss for stableCoin & -20% return token 
dft.iloss(0.8)
```
> -0.62%



```python
import defi.defi_tools as dft

# Impermanent loss for stableCoin & +60% return token 
dft.iloss(1.6, numerical=True)

```
> 0.027   # Same as 2.7%


<br>

### Buy&Hold vs Stake & Farming strategy


```python
import defi.defi_tools as dft

# Exercise: Get returns after 20 days, assuming token A is a stablecoin, token B perform + 150%
# individual staking pools for both = 0.01% & 0.05% daily
# liquidity-pool farming rewards =0.2% daily & Earn by fees/day = 0.01%
dft.compare(days=20, var_A=0, var_B=150, rw_pool_A=0.01, rw_pool_B=0.05, rw_pool_AB=0.2, fees_AB=0.01)
```

```json
{
 ""buy_hold"": ""75.00%"",
 ""stake"": ""75.60%"",
 ""farm"": ""71.96%"",

[Drive health](https://github.com/guydavis/machinaris/wiki/Drives) is monitored as with `smartctl` on Linux. Notifications can be sent to e-mail, telegram, discord, slack, etc.

![Drives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guydavis/machinaris-unraid/master/docs/img/drives_grid.png)

## Setup

Simplified setup allows you to either import your existing key mnemonic or generate a new one directly in the Machinaris WebUI on first launch:

![Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guydavis/machinaris-unraid/master/docs/img/machinaris_setup.png)

That's for fullnode (default) and farmer modes. However, for [harvester](https://github.com/guydavis/machinaris/wiki/Docker#harvester-only) you only need the farmer's CA certificates and for [plotter](https://github.com/guydavis/machinaris/wiki/Docker#plotter-only) only your pool and farmer public keys.

Immediately on setup, a [fast blockchain download](https://github.com/guydavis/machinaris/wiki/Keys#blockchain-initialization) will get you synced and farming in just hours, rather than the days required by the official GUI client.

## Configuration

Configuration updating for Chia, Plotman, and Chiadog directly from the WebUI.  

![Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guydavis/machinaris-unraid/master/docs/img/machinaris_settings.png)

Summary and details for connections and blockchains highlights your farm's status:

![Connections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guydavis/machinaris-unraid/master/docs/img/geolocation.png)

## Container CLI

While the WebUI is useful for quick and easy access, you also have the full power of a shell commandline (CLI) in the running Machinaris container.  All binaries are available to execute advanced commands:

![ContainerCLI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guydavis/machinaris-unraid/master/docs/img/machinaris_container_cli.png)

To enter an in-container shell, just type `docker exec -it machinaris bash` from the host OS.

## Worker Management

When Machinaris is [deployed to multiple systems](https://github.com/guydavis/machinaris/wiki/Workers) on your LAN, you can control each plotter, harvester, and farmer - all from a central WebUI on the Machinaris controller.  Configuration, monitoring, and alerting are all available in this centralized portal.

![Workers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guydavis/machinaris-unraid/master/docs/img/machinaris_workers.png)

Each worker will run one Machinaris container per blockchain: Chia, Flax, MMX, etc as a fullnode, harvester, or plotter.

## REST API

Machinaris includes a complete [REST API](api/machinaris.postman_collection.json) offering opportunities for integration and extension with other tools.

# SuperGreenOS

SuperGreenOS provides most features used when growing cannabis, all in one package, and controllable from your smartphone, pc, mac, linux, toaster, plumbus, whatnot...

It is the official firmware for the [SuperGreenController](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenController).

## Who is this document for

This document is for developpers that want to start playing with there controller's internal stuffs, or just setup their own hardware.
This repository is based on [SuperGreenOSBoilerplate](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenOSBoilerplate), please read the doc here first.

## Features

Here's what it can (or will) do:

- Lights on and off schedules
- Up to 6 separate led channels (you can put multiple leds behind one channel)
- Up to 3 separate timers, for full-cycle setups (veg + flo)
- Monitoring a wide range of sensors
- Data sent to a MQTT server
- Produce alerts based on sensor values
- Allows remote control
- Manual ventilation control
- Automatic ventilation control based on temperature and humidity
- `Stretch` mode, allows to choose how much you want your plant to stretch or thicken
- `Sunglass` mode, so you don't burn your eyes when you work on your plants
- More to come..

This is the firmware that runs the [SuperGreenController](https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenController).

# Workspace setup

If you haven't already done it, you'll to setup esp-idf's toolchain and sdk.

They have a very good quickstart [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html).

## Clone repo, build and run

Now you should be able to clone and build the firmware:

```

git clone https://github.com/supergreenlab/SuperGreenOS.git
cd SuperGreenOS
./update_templates.sh config.controller.json
./update_htmlapp.sh config.controller.json
make -j4

```

The plug your controller or any esp32 based board and run the commands:

```

make -j4 flash monitor
./write_spiffs.sh

```

The first command flashes the firmware, the second writes the embedded admin interface on the tiny file system (~20KB available).

# How to use

Once the firmware is flashed you can access the controller's wifi network, once connected go to http://192.168.4.1/fs/app.html,
this will display the html embedded admin interface, which allows you to easily modify any of the controller's parameter.

## Deployoment to Ethereum network and Verification

For private Ethereum test network make sure Ganache is running on HTTP://127.0.0.1:7545
* First configure `truffle-config.js` with your infura key and mnemonic key. You can reate files in top dirrectory under names `.infuraKey` and `.secret` and paste your keys in there
* If you planning to publish your project on github make sure you `.gitignore` your keys 
* Compile smart contracts with `truffle compile`
* Deploy to your local (Ganache) network run: `truffle migrate --reset ` or for Ethereum test network (Rinkeby) run: `truffle migrate --network rinkeby --reset` or change `rinkeby` to `ropsten`
* To verify contract code on Ethereum test network add your Etherscan API key to `.ethKey` and for (Rinkeby) run: `truffle run verify TestToken --network rinkeby` or change `rinkeby` to `ropsten`

OpenLeverage Protocol
=================

The OpenLeverage Protocol comprises Smart Contracts in Solidity for permissionless lending and borrowing assets for leverage trading with DEX integration.

- Through provided API, anyone can create a pair of lending pools for a specific token pair.
- LToken, similar to CToken of Compound, is an interest-bearing ERC-20 token to be received by the fund supplier when they *supply* ERC-20 tokens to the lending pools. The LToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates with a kinked model for borrowers.
- All margin trades will be executed against the liquidity pool of DEX, like Uniswap.
- Risk is calculated with real-time price from AMM.
- Positions are protected with OnDemand Oracle utilizing TWAP from AMM.

Before starting this repo, please read the [OpenLeverage Documentation](https://docs.openleverage.finance), describing how OpenLeverage works.

###### Readme in German can be found [here](README-de.md).

ProSeed adds a bundle of functionality to enhance sowing machines in the game.
With ProSeed you're able to create tramlines (with optional pre-emergence marking), halfside shutoff for creating the perfect tramlines, fertilizer shutoff and active feedback with sounds.

## Publishing
Only Wopster is allowed to publish any of this code as a mod to any mod site, or file sharing site. The code is open for your own use, but give credit where due. I will not accept support for any 'version' of the ProSeed that is obtained from a sketchy mod page. Versioning is controlled by me and not by any other page. This confuses people and really holds back the development which results in no fun for me!


## Special thanks to
Special thanks to gotchTOM and webalizer for allowing me to redo the mod for FS19/FS22!

## Warning!
Please be aware that this is a ***DEVELOPMENT VERSION***!
* The development version can break the game or your savegame!
* The development version doesn´t support the full feature package yet!

#### Multiplayer
This version should also work in Multiplayer.

# Installation / Releases
Currently the development version is only available via GitHub. When a official release version is avaiable you can download the latest version from the [release section](https://github.com/stijnwop/proSeed/releases).

> _Please note: if there's no release version available it means there's no official release yet._

All official releases will be available at the offical Farming Simulator ModHub.

For installing the release:

Windows: Copy the `FS22_proSeed.zip` into your `My Games\FarmingSimulator2022\mods` directory.

## Documentation

### Overview
When a sowing machine is attached the following HUD will be displayed.
![Image](docs/images/hud.png)

In the table below there's a description on what every bottom does.

| Number | Description |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 | Toggle pre-emergence marking (this only toggles the visually cultivated lines and not the actual tramline creation!) |
| 2 | Toggle fertilizer usage |
| 3 | Change the tramline mode (manual, semi and auto) |
| 4 | Change the tramline distance (to fit your followup machines e.g. spreader and sprayers) |
| 5 | Minimize and maximize the HUD display |
| 6 | Change track number (only in semi mode) |
| 7 | Toggle halfside shutoff mode |
| 8 | Toggle interactive sounds |

> **NOTE: Some functions / buttons are only available for certain modes, they will be marked grey when disabled.**

Further there are some visuals that help you guide your seeding process. In the top bar the seed usage and hectare counters are displayed. In order to reset them you can click on the reset button.
In the middle of the HUD the working width of your seeder is displayed together with the marker state. The big orange bar on the bottom displays if the tramline is active or if a part of the seeder is shutoff.

You can position the HUD to any position you desire and the position will be saved.

### Usage

#### Modes
In the table below the possible modes are explained. You can toggle the modes by clicking on the arrows shown at number 3 of the HUD image from above.

| Mode | Description | Supports helper |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Manual | In `Manual` mode the player has full freedom whether to create the tramline or not by simply pressing the buttons `KEY_lctrl + KEY_r`. The option to configure distance or counting tracks are disabled. | no
| Semi | In `Semi` mode the player has to configure the tramline distance by clicking on the arrows (increment is based on the working width). The tracks are counted automatically when the sowing machine is lifted, you can manually correct this in the HUD. Tramlines are created automatically. | yes
| Auto | In `Auto` mode the player only has to configure the tramline distance by clicking on the arrows (increment is based on the working width). Correct the working width of GPS when needed and the tracks will be counted automatically by the GuidanceSteering mod. Tramlines are created automatically. | no

> **NOTE: In order to use the mode `Auto` the [GuidanceSteering](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?mod_id=140328&title=fs2019) mod is required!**

#### How to start
If the number of total amount of lanes is even, always start with a half track otherwise the distance to the edge of the field will not be valid.
E.g. in the HUD above you have a total of 2 lanes `x / 2` so in this case you start with a half line.

Use the halfside shutoff function for creating the first track.
When using GuidanceSteering, the first track of GS must be aligned at the edge of the field and set to zero (`ALT + HOME`).
For the second track shift the GS track by half the working width towards the field edge.

A description of possible working widths and distances is given in this neat PDF file: [proSeed.pdf](https://github.com/stijnwop/proSeed/raw/master/docs/ProSeed.pdf) (Page 1: German; Page 2: English)

#### Using tramline animation
You can trigger an animation once the tramlines are active like so:

```xml
<vehicle>
    <proSeed>
       <tramLinesAnimation name=""tramLines"" speed=""1""/>
    </proSeed>

    <animations>
       <animation name=""tramLines"">
          <part node=""NODE_NAME"" startTime=""0"" endTime=""1"" startTrans=""0 1 0"" endTrans=""0 0 0"" />
       </animation>
    </animations>
</vehicle>
```

___This is a mod folder switcher with extra tools___

- Check mods to ensure that they (probably) work in game
- Check a collection against a save game to see what is used and what is not
- Resolve version differences of mods between collections

__NOTE:__ This will only run under Windows 10 or 11 - If you are still using Windows 7/8/8.1, you really should fix that, but in the meantime, you can run the last version that was supported, [v2.1.4](https://github.com/FSGModding/FSG_Mod_Assistant/releases/tag/v2.1.4)

[Full Documentation Site](https://fsgmodding.github.io/FSG_Mod_Assistant/)

## What this does

At it's core functionality, this is a file manager, and it has the ability to edit FS22's `gameSettings.xml` file to set one of your mod collections as the mod location the game reads.

## At A Glance

![main window](docs/img/mainarea-999.webp)

## What is a Broken Mod?

- If a mod file is named incorrectly and won't load in the game.
  - Suggest it might be a copy if the name looks like a copy
    - and what the name probably should be
  - Suggest you extract it if it looks like a collection of mods

- If a mod is not properly zipped.
  - Suggest that you zip it up
  - Suggest you move the contents of the folder if it looks like a mod pack
  - Suggest you remove the folder if it looks like garbage

- If a mod is not intended for FS22 (e.g. FS19 & FS17 mods)
  - Warn that you can't use it with this version

- If a file exists that is not a mod at all
  - Suggest you remove the file

## Usage

Download the installer for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com//FSGModding/FSG_Mod_Assistant/releases) page - the program will install with 1-click, and auto-run when it's ready.

Fixed APY Staking platform with Lockup and fixed APY, duration and max stake

## Workflow

- Deploy StakingPlatform with the appropriate parameters (See _Constructor_ below)
- Users should deposit their tokens before or during the staking period
- Run `Start()` function launch the staking
- Users can claim their rewards using `claimRewards()`
- Once staking is over users can withdraw their initial deposit using `withdraw()` (`withdraw()` calls `claimRewards()`)

## Constructor

```
   constructor(
        address _token,
        uint8 _fixedAPY,
        uint _durationInDays,
        uint _lockupDurationInDays,
        uint _maxStake,
    )
```

- Address of the ERC20 Token to be used by the Staking platform
- fixed APY rates (must be consistent with the maxStake)
- Duration of the staking (e.g, 365 == 1year)
- Lockup duration (Impossible to withdraw until the lockup period is finish)
- Max tokens that can be deposited by stake holders

## Examples

- Staking platform is deployed with 25% of APY
- _User1_ approve `100000 TKN`
- _User1_ deposit `100000 TKN`
- Staking platform starts
- after 1 day User1 can claim `~68.4750 TKN`
- after 1 year User1 can claim `25000 TKN`, 25% of 100,000 TKN

## `StakingPlatform`

### `constructor(address _token, uint8 _fixedAPY, uint256 _durationInDays, uint256 _lockDurationInDays, uint256 _maxAmountStaked)` (public)

constructor contains all the parameters of the staking platform

all parameters are immutable

### `startStaking()` (external)

function that start the staking

set `startPeriod` to the current current `block.timestamp`
set `lockupPeriod` which is `block.timestamp` + `lockupDuration`
and `endPeriod` which is `startPeriod` + `stakingDuration`

### `deposit(uint256 amount)` (external)

function that allows a user to deposit tokens

user must first approve the amount to deposit before calling this function,
cannot exceed the `maxAmountStaked`
`endPeriod` to equal 0 (Staking didn't started yet),
or `endPeriod` more than current `block.timestamp` (staking not finished yet)
`totalStaked + amount` must be less than `stakingMax`
that the amount deposited should greater than 0

### `withdraw(uint256 amount)` (external)

function that allows a user to withdraw its initial deposit

`block.timestamp` must be higher than `lockupPeriod` (lockupPeriod finished)
`amount` must be higher than `0`
`amount` must be lower or equal to the amount staked
withdraw reset all states variable for the `msg.sender` to 0, and claim rewards
if rewards to claim

### `withdrawAll()` (external)

function that allows a user to withdraw its initial deposit

must be called only when `block.timestamp` >= `lockupPeriod`
`block.timestamp` higher than `lockupPeriod` (lockupPeriod finished)
withdraw reset all states variable for the `msg.sender` to 0, and claim rewards
if rewards to claim

### `withdrawResidualBalance()` (external)

claim all remaining balance on the contract
Residual balance is all the remaining tokens that have not been distributed
(e.g, in case the number of stakeholders is not sufficient)

Can only be called one year after the end of the staking period
Cannot claim initial stakeholders deposit

### `amountStaked(address stakeHolder) → uint256` (external)

function that returns the amount of total Staked tokens
for a specific user

### `totalDeposited() → uint256` (external)

function that returns the amount of total Staked tokens
on the smart contract

### `rewardOf(address stakeHolder) → uint256` (external)

function that returns the amount of pending rewards
that can be claimed by the user

### `claimRewards()` (external)

function that claims pending rewards

transfer the pending rewards to the `msg.sender`

### `_calculateRewards(address stakeHolder) → uint256` (internal)

calculate rewards based on the `fixedAPY`, `_percentageTimeRemaining()`

the higher is the precision and the more the time remaining will be precise

### `_percentageTimeRemaining(address stakeHolder) → uint256` (internal)

function that returns the remaining time in seconds of the staking period

the higher is the precision and the more the time remaining will be precise

# Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

Crop recommendation is one of the most important aspects of precision agriculture. Crop recommendations are based on a number of factors. Precision agriculture seeks to define these criteria on a site-by-site basis in order to address crop selection issues. While the ""site-specific"" methodology has improved performance, there is still a need to monitor the systems' outcomes.Precision agriculture systems aren't all created equal. However, in agriculture, it is critical that the recommendations made are correct and precise, as errors can result in significant material and capital loss.

<!-- PROJECT STRUCTURE -->

## Project Structure

### Smart contracts

The contracts development and testing is done using the Hardhat framework in the smart_contracts folder, for this project there are 3 main contracts :
      <ul>
       <li><b>KryptoPunks.sol :</b></li>
This is the NFT collection contract, i used the ERC721A standard because it has lower gas usage for multiple NFT mint in the same transaction, the contract will allow user to mint items from the collection which are allowed to be staked in the NFT vault.
       <li><b>KryptoPunksToken.sol :</b></li>
The KryptoPunksToken or KPT is the ERC20 token used for distributing staking rewards, it's completly controlled by the stakingVault contract which is the only address allowed to mint new tokens to stakers.
       <li><b>NFTStakingVault.sol :</b></li>
The staking vault contract is at the center of this application, it allows users to stake their KryptoPunks items and calculate the KPT rewards accumulated for each item based on the staking period. When a user wants to unstake or claim the accrued rewards from his NFTs, the contract is responsible for minting the KPT tokens to the user by calling the KryptoPunksToken contract.
      </ul>

<b>The architecture of the application</b> is illustrated in the diagram below :

![staking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83681204/185807295-76ab7ea9-3f46-49bb-bf26-c43fa9de7002.png)

### User interface
   
The front end is built with React JS, it allows users to mint new KryptoPunks nfts and stake them in the vault for receiving KPT rewards over time, the app also give a simple admin dashboard for setting minting prices and maximum NFTs minted per tx.

The front-end is built using the following libraries:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Ethers.js:</b> used as interface between the UI and the deployed smart contract</li>
        <li><b>Web3modal:</b> for conecting to Metamask</li>
        <li><b>@reduxjs/toolkit & redux-persist:</b> for managing the app states (account, balance, blockchain) </li>
        <li><b>Material UI:</b> used for react components and styles </li>    
      </ul>
      
The home page is a modern NFT landing page that explains the KryptoPunks project and it's progression roadmap :

![Capture d’écran 2022-08-17 à 22 36 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83681204/185249401-0c9ee430-3e8a-46d7-949f-48113f434ceb.png)

The mint page allows user to mint new KryptoPunks and it contains all the information about the NFT collection (total supply, minting cost,...), and the details about the nfts held by the user (items owned, items staked, total reward accumulated,...).

![Capture d’écran 2022-08-17 à 22 48 18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83681204/185249853-36e1c15f-4f26-4aea-a060-604cb56cc52f.png)

On this page the user also finds a list of all the items he owns, which can be directly staked & unstaked from there and claim the reward that was accrued :

The dashboard can only be accessed by the nft contract owner from the account window by clicking on the account button in the top of the page, it gives the owner the possibility of withdraw the contract balance, changing nft minting parametres or changing contract state (paused):

<!-- USAGE GUIDE -->
## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Please install or have installed the following:
* [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
* [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) Chrome extension installed in your browser
* [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) for local smart contracts deployement and testing.

Clone this repo with the command :
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kaymen99/KryptoPunks-nft-staking-dapp.git
   cd KryptoPunks-nft-staking-dapp
   ```

### Contracts

As mentioned before the contracts are developed with the Hardhat framework, before deploying them you must first install the required dependancies by running :
   ```sh
   cd smart_contracts
   yarn
   ```
   
Next you need to setup the environement variables in the .env file, this are used when deploying the contracts :

   ```sh
    RINKEBY_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=""your etherscan api key""
    RINKEBY_RPC_URL=""Your rinkeby RPC url from alchemy or infura""
    POLYGON_RPC_URL=""Your polygon RPC url from alchemy or infura""
    MUMBAI_RPC_URL=""Your mumbai RPC url from alchemy or infura""
    PRIVATE_KEY=""your private key""
   ```
* <b>NOTE :</b> Only the private key is needed when deploying to the ganache network, the others variables are for deploying to the testnets or real networks and etherscan api key is for verifying your contracts on rinkeby etherscan.

After going through all the configuration step, you'll need to deploy the 3 contracts to the ganache network by running: 
   ```sh
   yarn deploy --network ganache
   ```
This will create a config.js file and an artifacts folder and transfer them to the src folder to enable the interaction between the contract and the UI

* <b>IMPORTANT :</b> I used the ganache network for development purposes only, you can choose another testnet or real network if you want, for that you need to add it to the hardhat.config file for example for the rinkeby testnet  

   ```sh
   rinkeby: {
      url: RINKEBY_RPC_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
      chainId: 4,
    }
   ```

If you want to test the vault/NFT contracts or the staking process, you can do it by running:
   ```sh
   yarn test
   ```
### Front end

To start the user interface just run the following commands :
   ```sh
   cd front-end
   yarn
   yarn start
   ```

```

## farming (travian plus)

the bot will open given village, selects all farmlists from the array, sends them, and go to sleep.  
this is by far the simplest implementation of a farm bot.

```python
# sends farmlist with index 1 (the one after the starter list)
# in your first village (index 0) in an interval of 60 seconds
kingbot.start_farming(village=0, farmlists=[1], interval=60)

#sends farmlist 1 and 3 in your second village in an interval of 30 seconds
kingbot.start_farming(1, [1,3], 30)
```

**village:**  
index of village _(0 is the first village)_

**farmlists:**  
index of farmlist _(0 is the starter list with only 10 farms)_  
must be an _array_! you can send multiple lists in this interval

**interval:**  
interval of sending the list _in seconds_

you can stack as many of them together if you want.  
it's also possible to send different farmlist in the same village in different intervals.

## sorting out yellow / red farms

**note that this feature is not fully tested yet!**  
_i need someone with alot of big farmlists to test this feature for me_

this line will let the bot automaticly sort out red or/and yellow farms for you.  
it is checking all given farmlists in an interval (_in seconds_) for danger farms.  
if a farm is yellow or red, and you set the equivalent value to `True`, this farm will be placed onto the farmlist with the index given by the paramter `to_list`.  
the starter farmlist is index 0.

```python
kingbot.sort_danger_farms(farmlists=[0], to_list=1, red=True, yellow=False, interval=240)
```

**farmlists:**  
array of farmlist indexes _(start farmlist is 0)_

**to_list:**  
index of the farmlist the 'danger' farms will be put into  
`-1` if you want the farm to be removed instead of moved to another list

**red:**  
`True` if you want red farms to be sorted out

**yellow:**  
`True` if you want also yellow farms to be sorted out

**interval:**  
interval of checking the farmlists _in seconds_

## farmlists as .txt file (no travian plus needed)

this technique is a little bit slower than then one with travian plus.  
the bot will manually launch every attack at the rally point.  
i only implemented this feature for people who doesn't want to pay for the game and still want to farm only around 200 villages.

you have to create a file named `farmlist.txt` in `assets/` folder, which looks like the following: _(attention for separators!)_

```csv
-26;-34;120;0;1,2
-28;-24;70;0;1,2,3,4
-30;-57;300;0;1,2
```

**pattern:**  
x-coordinate **;** y-coordinate **;** time to wait till sending the troops again in seconds **;** index of village **;** index of unit in the horizontal bar **,** amount of units

every line represents one farm. the first 2 values are the x- and y-coordinates.  
the third value is the time _(in seconds)_ the bot waits until it sends the farm again.  
fourth value is the village from where the troops are going to be send off.  
the last values _(comma separated!)_ are the amount and index of the unit which is going to be send.  
you can find out the index when trying to launch a new attack. you will be asked which village you want to attack and which troops you wanna use.  
from left to right, starting at 0, these are the indexes of the units you want to use.  
for example _(gauls)_: 0 = phalanx, 1 = swordsman.  
if you want to send different units, just stack them at the end.  
...0,1,3,4 -> this would send 1 of unit 0 and 4 of unit 3 to this farm.

**attention:**  
_adding a unit index of `-1` will send **all** units with max number to this farm._  
_adding a unit value of `-1` will send **all** units of this type to this farm._

add the following line to your `start.py` script:

```python
kingbot.start_custom_farmlist(reload=False)
```

__reload:__  
if you set this value to `True` the bot will rescan your farmlist file every minute for changing lines  
you can add or remove farms without restarting the script

## celebrations

the bot will start a small celebration in given villages everytime the queue is empty and you got enough resources.  
it will automatically wake up 5 seconds after one celebration in any village is finished.

```python
kingbot.celebrate(villages=[0, 2, 4], interval=1000)
```

__villages:__  
array of villages _(starting at zero)_ in which the bot should start celebrations

__interval:__ _(optional -> default = 1000)_  
just a save interval for the bot to wake up and check wether it can start a celebration  
it will automatically adjust this interval to wake up right after a celebration is finished

## adventures

this enables auto sending the hero on adventures.  
you hero won't die, because they will only start when the hero is above x hp.

```python
kingbot.start_adventures(interval=500, health=35)
```

**interval:** _(optional -> default = 100)_  
time _in seconds_ the hero thread will sleep until it checks for a new adventure again

**health:** _(optional -> default = 50)_  
minimum health _(in percent)_ of hero to start an adventure

## dodge incoming attacks

since everybody hates to get attacked at night, the bot is able do dodge incoming attacks.  
it will send your units to a given village for raid. make sure the village is inactive and valid.

the bot will wake up 10 minutes before the attack lands, so take a target which is at least 5:01 minutes away. (7:00 if you got a map and also send your hero)  
use this method for every village you want to save.

```python
kingbot.dodge_attack(village=0, units=[1, 0, 3], target=[1, 1], save_resources=True, units_train=[2, 4])
```

**village:**  
index of village which the bot is going to check _(starting at 0)_

**units:**  
array of unit indexes which are going to be saved _(starting at 0)_  
insert `-1` _(units=[-1])_ to save **all** available units in this village

**target:**  
first index is the x-coordinate and second for the y-coordinate of the village the bot will send the units for a robbery


**save_resources:**  
`True` if you want to save the resources and NPC it for training troops.  
**attention! this feature will consume your gold, please consider it.**

**units_train:**  
array of unit indexes which are going to be trained **_(starting at 1)_**

## upgrade units in smithy

```python
kingbot.upgrade_units_smithy(village=0, units=[21, 22])
```
__village:__  
index of village _(starting at 0)_

__units:__  
list of units you want to upgrade   
first one with highest priority, last one with lowest  

| roman                  | teuton              | gaul                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1: legionnaire         | 11: clubswinger     | 21: phalanx           |
| 2: praetorian          | 12: spearfighter    | 22: swordsman         |
| 3: imperian            | 13: axefighter      | 23: pathfinder        |
| 4: equites legati      | 14: scout           | 24: theutates thunder |
| 5: equites imperatoris | 15: paladin         | 25: druidrider        |
| 6: equites caesaris    | 16: teutonic knight | 26: headuan           |
| 7: battering ram       | 17: ram             | 27: ram               |
| 8: fire catapult       | 18: catapult        | 28: trebuchet         |
| 9: senator             | 19: chief           | 29: chieftain         |
| 10: settler            | 20: settler         | 30: settler           |

the bot checks if it can upgrade given units in given order. first it checks swordsman in this example and if they are not available or maxed out, it will try to upgrade phalax again.  
you can increase the list as long as you want to.

the bot can't switch smithy pages for now, so make sure the window is big enough to cover 8 slots.   
By default this should be the case, otherwise it will just cover the 4 slots on the front for now.

sleeping time will be the time the academy needs to finish the current research, so the bot won't wake up unnecessarily in the given interval.

## upgrade resource fields / buildings

this function will construct and upgrade building as well as upgrade resources. finish 5 mins earlier is enable by default.
this function will upgrade/construct based on json file that contains queue for upgrade/construct building.
the json file can be edit while this function running, so didn't need to restart the function if you want add new queue to json file.

the json file have **strict structure that need to be fulfilled** if you want to use this function.
this is an example of queue on json file:

```json
{""queues"":[
    {
        ""queueLocation"": ""Village"",
        ""queueType"": ""Construct"",
        ""queueBuilding"": ""Bakery""
    }
    {
        ""queueLocation"": ""Resources"",
        ""queueBuilding"": ""buildingLocation9""
    }
]}
```

**queueLocation:**
there is 2 values for this keyword, `Village` and `Resources`._(case sensitive)_
- choose `Village` if you want to `Upgrade` or `Construct` building.
- choose `Resources` when you want to upgrade resources.

**queueType:**
there is 2 values for this keyword, `Construct` and `Upgrade`._(case sensitive)_
- choose `Construct` for constructing building.
- choose `Upgrade` for upgrading building.

**queueBuilding:**
this keyword filled with building name. if you want to upgrade resources, it point to slot id of resources that you want to upgrade._(case sensitive)_
on the picture below you can see all field slot id's for your reference when upgrading resources.
these stay the same no matter what kind of village you have (even in 15er crop villages).

there is an example json file in assets folder that contain queue for your reference.
there is also building.json file that contains building name for your reference.

```python
kingbot.start_building(village=2, file_name='village_2.json', interval=1800)
```

**village:**  
index of the village the slot should be upgraded in _(starting at 0)_

**file_name:**  
json file that contain queue

**interval:** _(optional -> default = 1800)_
interval for checking queue

**attention! this feature can only be used in international gameworld**

![resource-fields](https://scriptworld.net/assets/king-bot/resourceFields.png)

## robber hideouts

the bot will check for robber hideouts and it will send your units to attack them, it will retry with the same hideout until its destroyed, and then it will move on to the next and so on.

the bot will not perform the attack if the troops are moving, either returning or leaving the village, and thus avoid repeating unnecessary attacks.

```python
kingbot.robber_hideout(village=0, units={10:1, 4:100, 2:-1}, interval=600,)
```

**village:**  
index of village from where the bot will attack the robbers **_(starting at 0)_**

**_(units={10:1, 4:100, 2:-1})_**

**interval:** _(optional -> default = 600)_
interval for checking robber hideouts

## robber camps

the bot will check for robber camps and will send the specified units to attack all the camps at once while there are units available, as well as avoid attacking those already attacked before.

```python
kingbot.robber_camp(village=0, units={10:1, 0:300}, interval=600,)
```

**village:**  
index of village from where the bot will attack the robber camps **_(starting at 0)_**

**units:**  
dictionary of units you want to send to the robber camps **_(starting at 0)_**
the format of the units are expressed as a pair: **{<unit index>: <quantity>}**

hero is ""10:1""
ex: as teuton send hero and 300 clubswinger
**_(units={10:1, 0:300})_**

**interval:** _(optional -> default = 600)_
interval for checking robber camps

## train troops

the bot will train new troops every time interval, if more than one type of unit is specified, the bot will divide the resources by each type of units and try to train as much as possible of each.

```python
kingbot.train_troops(village=0, units=[1, 2], interval=600)
```

**village:**  
index of village which the bot is going to train troops **_(starting at 0)_**

# start options

just an overview. for details check each topic.

| short | long        | arguments      | description             |
| :---: | :---------: | :------------: | :---------------------: |
| -e    | --email     | your_email     | optional for login      |
| -p    | --password  | your_password  | optional for login      |
| -w    | --gameworld | your_gameworld | optional for login      |
| -m    | -           | -              | login manually          |
| -h    | -           | -              | no browser window       |
| -r    | -           | -              | connect to last session |

## provide credentials

```bash
$ python start.py -e email@test.de -p your_password -w your_gameworld
$ python start.py --email email@test.de --password your_password --gameworld your_gameworld
```

if you don't want to store your credentials into a file, just provide them via arguments like this.  
it's also possible to login manually if you dont want to provide your login credentials at all. _see below: login manually_

all of these options are optional, you can always provice some via code, and some via start options, that's up to you.

## headless browsing

```bash
$ python start.py -h
```

if you don't wont a browser window to pop up, or using the script on a dedicated server with no gui, it is possible to run the script in headless mode.  
the console window will inform you about important actions the bot will do.

## login manually

```bash
$ python start.py -m 120
```

if you don't trust my program, even if it' open source, you can login manually and don't even type your email or password anywhere in my script.  
the bot will open the main page of travian kingdoms.  
it will now wait _120 seconds (given time via argument)_ for you to log into your account.  
after you are logged in, just open the gameworld you want your bot to run in.  
if you are finished, just wait for the timer to end, so the bot can do its work.

**note:** _this is not possible in headless mode!_

## remote browser

```bash
$ python start.py -r
```

if the script exists because of an exception, it's possible to re-use the browser session so you don't have to go through the whole login process again.  
just don't exit the browser window and make sure to remove the functions in the script, which the bot already completed in last session.  

__note:__ _debug mode must be enabled!_

## proxy

```python
proxy = '127.0.0.1:1234'
```

if you want to surf the web via proxy, just insert it in `start.py`. this is also possible in headless mode.  
if the proxy is set to `''`, it's going to be disabled. it's also disabled by default.

# faq

**can i play the game while the bot is running?**  
yes. just open a new browser window and leave the bot window in the background. login to your gameworld and keep playing.  
one instance doesn't effect another browser instance. you can also start your script without a browser window.

**can i get banned for using the bot?**  
yes, but the chances are below 1%. it's nearly impossible to detect this bot, because it clicks all buttons just like a human would do.  
also there is browser and sleeping time delay, so they can't event check if the interval is always the same.

__my internet is really slow. the bot is too fast and can't find elements!__  
`settings.browser_speed = 1.0` -> just increase this value. it will adjust __all__ sleep timers.  
you will find that value in `start.py` file.

1131,SmartGreenhouse,obernardovieira,N/A,https://github.com/obernardovieira/SmartGreenhouse,https://api.github.com/repos/obernardovieira/SmartGreenhouse,:leaves: An arduino system for autonomous greenhouse. Only the basic. :four_leaf_clover:,"# SmartGreenhouse

### Description:
A repository with the basic functions to an autonomous greenhouse.
There is no limited number of connected components (e.g. sensors)

### Installation:
There is not specific installation, it just need to be uploaded to arduino. But the data struct need to be configured to make the components work.
**How to configure a new component**
*This is really easy to add, just follow the steps below*
* 1. Increment the number os components
  * Go to file ""datatype.h"" and in ""#define TOTAL_COMPONENTS 3"" change 3 to the number of your components
* 2. Upload the sketch and run it
  * Run the arduino and use the command ""c help"" trough the Serial Monitor
* 3. Give them things to do
  * Go to file ""components.h"" the last function called ""check_components"" and crete your own method to controle one component,
  using the output of another one, or by time. You know what to do. (Don't forget to reupload)


### Usage:
After the installation, everything should be running fine. If any port number and/or type is change, it changes in realtime, with need to restart. But there ar some precaution, read **Notes** below!
**Note** Changes are not automatically updated, the user needs to update using the command *save*. Data is automatically loaded. 
**Note(2)** It's recomended to not disconnect components from one port and connect to another with arduino running. So, update the data, save it, turn of arduino, change ports and start again.
#### In this example
In this example it uses three components, in this case, two leds and one **potentiometer** (the circuit sketch is at the end)
***The first led*** is controlled by time. At the time *X* it turns on, at the time *Y* it turns off
***The second led*** is controlled using the potentiometer's output.
It can be used as a water dropped controller by hour, using an rtc, and a heater and coller controlled by temperature.
This is just an example. See th sketch ![here](https://github.com/obernardovieira/SmartGreenhouse)

### Contributing:
Everyone is free to contribute. Fork the project, make you changes and pull request. If you find bugs open an issue, or you can fix by yourself just forking, make changings and then pull request. It's complitly free project, so you can download and use it on your own.

1134,MarketGardenCropPlanner,gtoleary5,N/A,https://github.com/gtoleary5/MarketGardenCropPlanner,https://api.github.com/repos/gtoleary5/MarketGardenCropPlanner,This project is a free Excel workbook designed to help market gardeners and CSA farmers organize and plan their operations.,"# MarketGardenCropPlanner

What is this tool and what can it do?

This is a business and operations planning tool designed for consumer-supported agriculture (CSA) farms. The basic business model is that customers buy farm products on a subscription basis, with deliveries being made on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. 

This tool attempts to answer the following questions:
1.	What can I plant in my area?
2.	When should I plant these crops?
3.	When will they be ready?
4.	How should I price my CSA shares?
5.	What is the financial outlook of my farm?

To answer the above questions, this tool performs the following functions:
1.	Organize reference data on the Planting Constraints, DS (Direct Seeding) Crop Ref, and TP (Transplant) Crop Ref sheets.
  a.	This reference data is going to vary with the local climate conditions. I would recommend reviewing and updating this data if any of the later calculations don’t pass the sniff test.

2.	Business planning: On the Annual Input sheet, users can adjust the input parameters (highlighted cells) to model the finances of their farm. 
  a.	The Planning Period Start and Planning Period End values are by default set to 1 year. If you want to plan out multiple seasons at a time, you may extend this to 2 or more years.

3.	CSA Share Modelling: After validating the reference data and clicking the Recalculate Availability button on the Intro sheet, the workbook will calculate when your crops will be available (represented by green cells on the Weekly CSA Share Content sheet).
  a.	By default, the workbook will order one unit of each available crop. That is, if you’re tracking tomato yield by the pound and your tomatoes are available for 10 weeks in the season, then each CSA share will be allocated 10 pounds of tomatoes.
    i.	If the ‘one-of-each’ allocation isn’t practical, you may change then ordered quantity by changing the numbers on the Weekly CSA Share Content sheet. Fractional values are accepted.
  b.	As you add and subtract items from your weekly CSA shares, you’ll notice the two summary rows at the bottom of the sheet are keeping track of how much each share is worth. This information is used to calculate the average Weekly CSA Share price in cell B1 of the Annual plan sheet.

4.	Farm Operations Planning: Once you have customized your weekly CSA shares, you can click the Create Farm Plan button on the Intro sheet to generate a consolidated operations calendar along with seed orders, greenhouse and crop schedules, and weekly harvest targets.
  a.	Calendar – This sheet offers a consolidated weekly schedule of Field Prep, Greenhouse, and Field Planting work.
  b.	Weekly CSA Harvest Target – This sheet simply multiplies the Weekly CSA Share Content table by the number of shares offered. 
  c.	Seed Sheet – This sheet calculates the amount of seed needed for each crop this season.
  d.	Greenhouse Schedule – This sheet calculates the number of trays each transplanted crop needs in the greenhouse and on what days they should be started.
  e.	Crop Sheet – This sheet calculates the planting frequency and quantity for each crop in order to meet the weekly harvest targets.
  f.	Field Ops – This sheet calculates the field prep dates for the various planting groups outlined in the Crop Sheet.
  g.	Field Planting Schedule – This sheet provides weekly summaries of the amount of planting needed to meet the weekly harvest targets. Mostly, it is used in the Crop Sheet calculations.

Various programs to manage sensor data from a freshwater prawn grow, and make it available from anywhere in the world, via a minimal UI.

![Get a Skillet... Prawnto](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Terkwood/c37c50d41bcc84b409eeaa555f788ed0/raw/ec42ccbdee0c3f518400253b5e1270f5488f4f1c/prawnto.gif)

We currently support the display of temperature and pH readings onto small LED matrix screens attached to inexpensive ESP8266 microcontrollers.

Temperature and pH levels are read continuously from the prawns' tank using a DS18B20 submersible temperature sensor, and a SEN 0169 pH meter.

## Features

Implements a gated frontend in Rust/webassembly which renders temp & pH levels of tanks.  This can be used to monitor tank levels from afar. 

Provides support for continuous sensing of pH levels using a SEN0169 pH sensor linked to an ESP8266 microcontroller.

Provides basic temperature readings for a given aquarium, using a DS18B20 temp sensor hooked to an ESP8266 microcontroller. 

Displays temp and pH readings on remotely networked LED arrays.

Provides a ""pH Reference Calibration"" webservice which allows pH sensors to query their high & low pH calibration values in millivolts when coming online.

Includes several docker images and config which can be hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. These include:

- ph & temp sensor tracker (listens for temp & pH updates provided by ESP8266 over MQTT and writes them to database)
- led status helper (polls database for the temp & pH of individual tanks, and pushes a formatted message to MQTT; this can be read by LED microcontroller units)
- redis update aggregator (pushes temp & pH level updates to google cloud/pub sub)
- mosquitto setup in docker compose
- redis setup in docker compose (stores miscellaneous data, including tank status for LED display)

Includes basic examples of pH meter readings using an Arduino, and serial communication between an Arduino wired to an ESP8266.

Includes configuration for a google container OS instance.  Runs a small Rocket.rs webserver which can broker temp & pH data requests for the frontend and receive updates to these levels from google cloud pub/sub push mechanism.

1136,Poultry-farming-management-system,Musanza,N/A,https://github.com/Musanza/Poultry-farming-management-system,https://api.github.com/repos/Musanza/Poultry-farming-management-system,The aim of this study was to develop an online poultry farming management system to help poultry farmers manage their farms easily.,"# About Us

Poultry farming is the raising of birds either domestically or commercially for primarily meat or eggs but also for feathers. Chickens, ducks and turkeys are the most raised birds with chickens being the most common raised birds. The chickens which are raised for eggs are called layer chickens, and the chickens which are raised for their meat production are called broiler chickens. Poultry farming business has numerous benefits. As a result many farmers prefer to invest in this business. People generally establish poultry farming for the purpose of producing eggs, meat and generating high revenue from these products. All over the world billions of chickens are being raised as a good source of food from their eggs and meat. Most poultry farming businesses face the challenges of managing the farm this is mostly because of the file system of keeping records and entry of transactions. Currently the poultry farm industry mainly uses the ledgers based system and manual entry for each transaction required, record of eggs, quantity of birds as well as sales and expense record is calculated on separate ledgers. Production percentage is calculated manually for every day production. Feed consumption per day or month is first written and them total is calculated. Sales and expense record as well as profit and loss calculations require a lot of time to go through.

The aim of this study was to develop an online poultry farming management system to help poultry farmers manage their farms easily.

# Objectives

    To automate the manual means of recording poultry farming records.
    To provide a system that can facilitate the update of poultry farming records.
    To develop a system that will aid the presentation of reports pertaining the poultry farming.

The farm monitoring system is a mixture of hardware and software additives. The hardware part includes embedded systems and software program is the Arduino ide.The Arduino ide displays readings from sensors are inserted using the hardware.The special sensors used are temperature and humidity sensor,pir sensor and soil moisture 
sensor. The facts gathered with the aid of the sensors is sent to the Arduino UNO microcontroller ATmega328.The gathered information may be displayed in a Arduino IDE. A GSM module is hooked up with the Arduino to facilitate messaging service which updates the farmers each 10 seconds approximately the climate conditions of the subject.
IV.HARDWARE USED
This project is aided with many hardwares. This proposed technology is an amalgamation of different sensors, microcontroller and communication medium to help the farmers to work on their farms.

A.Arduino uno

Arduino is a microcontroller to control the working of the sensors and manage the working of the device. The Uno version of Arduino is implemented in this project. It was developed by Arduino CC. The Arduino board comes with various number of pins. The pins are categorized as output and input pins. The input pins ac cepts digital as well as analog pins. It has 14 digital pins and 
6 analog pins. It accepts 7 to 20 volts of power for working. It also has an USB port. The Uno was the first version of Arduino to be introduced in the Arduino family. 

B.DHT11 Temperature And Humidity Sensor

The DHT11 Temperature And Humidity sensor is used to sense temperature and humidity present in the atmosphere. It has 3 pins generally. One pin is used for transmitting signals, the next pin is used to receive signals and the last pin is data transfer. It can be used for prolonged time period. It gives approximate results. It regularly sends information to Arduino Uno. The information
consists the signals which contain the values gathered about temperature and humidity. It is reliable on nature. It gives a very fast response. 

C.Soil Moisture sensor

The Soil Moisture sensor is used to sense moisture content in the soil. It checks the volume of water content or moisture present in the soil. The calculations are done in the soil moisture sensor through coefficients. It estimates the volume of water content in the soil. It detects the water content in the soil and gets and sends the analog signals which is shown digitally. It transmits
the the signals containing information or data or values of the condition of soil to Arduino to futher process it and display.

D.PIR Sensor

PIR sensor stands for Passive Infrared Sensor. It detects the movement around it and sends the signals accordingly. It radiates electromagnetic radiation. It hits the object and comes back to the PIR sensor telling that there is presence of an object in a specified range. An led or Buzzer can be attached with PIR sensor so that the hindrance can be detected easily. It will help the farmer to know if any animal has broken into field and is destroying  crops. In this way the farmer can save his crops.

E.GSM Shield
The GSM Shield is used as a method of communication in this proposed technology. The GSM Shield is sed to send text messages to the farmer’s cell phone about the conditions of the temperature, humidity soil and field area. A separate coding has to be done for gsm shield in Arduino. It needs a sim to implement it. The number of the sim has to be fed in the coding. The number would belong to
farmer to which the messages has to be sent. The values detected and transmitted by the sensors to Arduino is sent by the gsm to the cell phone. Hence it uses a network which does not require internet and overcpmes the biggest loop hole of projects of this domain. 
It can also be used to make voice calls. It is bas3d on radio modem M10 Quectel. It incorporates AT Commands. It also has several pins to connect to. It uses TCP and UDP protocol for sending data packets. It uses HTTP which is HyperText Transfer Protocol.


The Farm Monitoring System can be used for destiny factors of agriculture. This would be a relief for farmers since it decreases the load of manual efforts A gadget to      screen moisture levels within the soil changed into constructed and the assignment furnished an possibility to take a look at        the prevailing structures, at the side of their features anddownsides. The stated gadget 
may be used to turn on/off the water sprinkler in keeping with soil moisture levels thereby automating the technique of 
irrigation that is one of the most time ingesting activities in farming. Agriculture is one of the most effort-consuming hobby.     The device makes use of statistics from soil moisture sensors to irrigate soil FUTURE SCOPE
The proposed assignment may be further greater with the aid of including pump to  the       machine to facilitate computerized irrigation. The automated irrigation  device may be triggered when the moisture      content of the soil is going under the brink       stage.  The threshold degree can be decided    in the code written for Arduino. So whenever the fee for moisture goes under the brink
degree, the pump gets mechanically on and       irrigation is performed to an ok  degree.To improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the machine, the noted recommendations can be placed into attention. Alternative of controlling the water pump may be given to the farmer by way of which they are able to turn on or off the pump to be able to start or prevent the manner of irrigation without being there on     farm at that gift time. The farmer can know   earlier about the negative climate situations. In such 
instances farmer might also want to    forestall the machine remotely or routinely. The concept of the usage of IOT for 
irrigation can be prolonged in addition to  other tasks in farming together with farm   animals management, fireplace detection and climate manage.This could limit human intervention in   farming sports.

FS22 Multiplayer Dedicated Server Companion saves all chat data to the current savegame and gives more control over dedicated servers.

This is a mod file for [Farming-Simulator 22](https://www.farming-simulator.com/) dedicated servers and clients to expand features for dedicated servers.  

Note: This is still a work in progress mod.  Not all features listed below are currently active and working as they should.

__Features ans Stuff__
- [Chat Logger](#chat-logger) - Logs player chats and saves them to active savegame as ChatLogger.xml
- [Chat Notifications](#chat-notifications) - Server will respond and post updates in in-game chat window.
- [Auto Admin](#auto-admin) - Admins can set to have them set as admin every time they join server in future.
- [Chat Commands](#chat-commands) - Change settings with chat commands.
- [Expand Link XML](#expand-link-xml) - Expand data output in server's Link XML API.

- [Screenshots](#screenshots)
- [Wanted Features](#wanted-features)
- [Known Issues](#known-issues)
- [Special Notes](#special-notes)

## Chat Logger
- Logs player chats and saves them to active savegame and in modSettings folder as ChatLogger.xml

Chat Logger listens for player chats and collects that data to save in an xml format that can easily be extracted.  

```xml
<chatLogger>
    <chat sender=""Greg"" msg=""Hi Everyone!"" farmId=""1"" fromUserId=""1tMDuQRobBhJvt2UQfsKUvCKQVHvvMJJ3svvjdfasdS4="" timestamp=""2023-01-08 13:27:53""/>
    <chat sender=""Bill"" msg=""Hey Greg!"" farmId=""1"" fromUserId=""1tMDuQRobBhJvt2UQfsKUvCKQVHvvMJJ3svvjdfasdS4="" timestamp=""2023-01-08 12:55:24""/>
    <chat sender=""Jeff"" msg=""Howdy goes it?"" farmId=""1"" fromUserId=""1tMDuQRobBhJvt2UQfsKUvCKQVHvvMJJ3svvjdfasdS4="" timestamp=""2023-01-08 12:55:24""/>
</chatLogger>
```

## Chat Notifications
- Server will respond and post updates in in-game chat window.

Server listens for the following chat text as set in the lang files: 

```xml
<text name=""chat_greetingTrigger01""     text=""hi"" />
<text name=""chat_greetingTrigger02""     text=""hello"" />
<text name=""chat_greetingTrigger03""     text=""hey"" />
<text name=""chat_greetingTrigger04""     text=""howdy"" />
<text name=""chat_greetingTrigger05""     text=""sup"" />
```

Server will respond with the following:

```xml
<text name=""chat_greeting01""            text=""Hey %s!"" />
<text name=""chat_greeting02""            text=""Hi there %s!"" />
<text name=""chat_greeting03""            text=""Hello %s!"" />
<text name=""chat_greeting04""            text=""Good day %s!"" />
<text name=""chat_greeting05""            text=""Howdy %s!"" />
```

Server will notify of the following actions:

Player Becomes Server Admin

> *PlayerName* is now Admin!

Server save game is triggered

> Game Saved Successfully!

## Auto Admin
- Admins can set to have them set as admin every time they join server in future.

Auto Admin will automatically save player data to Admins.xml within the modSettings folder on the server when a player becomes admin.  When player returns to the server, the server will check to see if that player is in the Admins.xml file, and if true, log them in as admin automatically.  

The admin can set the system to forget them with the *#forgetMe* text command, and it will no longer automatically make them admin.  The admin can reenable by typing *#rememberMe* in the text chat.  

## Chat Commands
- Change settings with chat commands.

  - #meAdmin - If user has logged in as admin before, they can use this to make them admin again upon return to server.
  - #meNoAdmin - Removes admin from yourself on current session.
  - #getUsers - Displays all available users on server with ID.
  - #moo - This command prints a text cow because why not.
  - #makeAdmin - Admin can use this command to make another online user an admin.  User ID provided from #getUsers command.
  - #rememberMe - Sets user to auto admin when they log on the server.
  - #forgetMe - Sets user to no longer auto admin when they log on the server.
  - #getFarms - Displays all available farms on server with ID.
  - #makeFM - Add user to farm with user id and farm id.  User ID provided from #getUsers command.  Farm ID provided from #getFarms command.
  - #saveVehicles - Saves locations of all vehicles on the server to a file to be called later with #resetVehicles.

## Expand Link XML
- Expand data output in server's Link XML API.

Currently only admin data from Admins.xml is added to the Link XML.  We do have plans to keep expanding this feature for use with the Farm Sim Game Bot.

## Wanted Features
- MOTH - Message of the day setting to welcome players when they join the server, or on a timer.
- Vehicles locations save and reset ability.  The ability to save where vehicles are parked, then use a command to reset all vehicles to those remembered locations.  Troll cleanup, or put vehicles away when done.
- Vehicle refill - a feature that will auto fill everything on a farm.  Seed, fert, fuel, electric, etc?

## Known Issues
- #meNoAdmin - Remove admin perms.  Does not currently work.  Unable to remove without reconnecting to the server.
- #makeFM - Not complete.  Does not currently work.
- #saveVehicles - Not complete. Does not currently work.

## Special Notes
- We know that it is possible to have discord to server chat, however that requires FTP access to the server.  It is not possible to inject data into the server remotely without updating the savegame and restarting the server.  Farm Sim Game Bot will not support this ability as FTP access can create security concerns.

# FarmGym

FarmGym is a Farming Environment Gym factory intended to model sequential decision-making on farms seen as dynamical system with many entities interacting.
FarmGym offers the possibility to build ad-hoc games by specifying a farm with different entities, different rules and scores.
This enables to consider from very simple to highly complicated environments. 
The following [user-guide](FarmGym.pdf) contains detailed presentation of FarmGym.

## Getting started

The following [user-guide](FarmGym.pdf) contains detailed presentation of FarmGym. 

### Illustrative notebooks

As a first illustration of farm-gym, one can look at the following colab notebooks: the first is an ""Interactive farm"" [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vUkYnRyxNEAgd8cuZKRn6iduroSYSj8O?usp=sharing) the second is a notebook in which we train a basic PPO agent on the same farm [![Open In Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AauxwIGebI11fF1sJgZp9nYx5M1SoPfV?usp=sharing). The first notebook allow a user to be the agent, by inputing manually the actions to play on a 1x1 farm containing beans with pests and weeds. The second notebook is a very basic implementation of PPO on the same farm. These notebooks were made using [rlberry-farms](https://github.com/farm-gym/rlberry-farms) which is a collection of two very simple farms on which one can try some classical RL algorithms with [rlberry](https://github.com/rlberry-py/rlberry) library. 


### Packages
It is recommended to use gym version >= 0.25.2, due to better support of dictionaries to define Spaces.

### Entities 
Minimal entities to define a farm are the Weather, the Soil and the Plant. 
Additional entities can be added, such as Birds, Pests, Weeds, or Facilities (e.g. Scarescrow, Hedge) and Fertilizers.
Each entity offers a list of actions made available to the learner.

### Rules 
The rules typically specify the initial and stopping conditions of the game, the subset of actions allowed for the considered game,
or the number of actions allowed each day.

### Score
The score may incorporate several features such as yield, biodiversity, resource usage, and specifies the cost of each action.

### Games
 Specifying various entities, rules and scores enables to generate various games. 
 FarmGym comes with a bunch of predefined games that can be seen as illustrative examples to build user-defined games.

### Minimal environment
```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.farms_1x1.clay_corn.farm import env

farm = env()

is_done = False
while not is_done:
    obs, reward, is_done, info = farm.step(farm.action_space.sample())
```
Note however that a FarmGym environment implements AO-MDP (Actively-observed Markov Decision Processes), and not just PO-MDP.
This can be recasted into a two-stage PD-MDP, alternating between observation steps and intervention steps.
Using the gym PO-MDP approach, the action space combines all observation-actions and intervention-actions, 
so that asking random actions may generate observation-actions at intervention steps or
intervention-actions at observation steps. 

Alternatively, one may want to separate between observation and intervention times, and asks random observation-action
or random interention-action at the appropriate time. 
We provide such an example below, here using the farmgym_step function instead of step.
```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.farms_1x1.clay_corn.farm import env

farm = env()

is_done = False
while not is_done:
    observation_schedule = []
    observation_schedule.append(farm.random_allowed_observation())
    obs1, _, _, info = farm.farmgym_step(observation_schedule)
    obs_cost = info['observation cost']

    intervention_schedule = []
    intervention_schedule.append(farm.random_allowed_intervention())
    obs2, reward, is_done, info = farm.farmgym_step(intervention_schedule)
    int_cost= info[""intervention cost""]
```
The difference between step and farmgym_step is the format of the action given as input.
Any gym action can be converted into its corresponding farm_gym format using farm.gymaction_to_farmgymaction.

### Logging

To know what happened in the farm at time of death, use the debug log-level

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Rendering
The basic rendering option is to print a farm, which output a text representation of the farm with all entities and available actions.
When rendering is called with farm.render(), the environment produces an image representing the farm at the current day.
Once a game is done, it is possible to assemble all these images into a movie, calling the method generate_video. 
It is also possible to generate a gif using the method generatee_gif.
Further, we store all these figures and the movie in a sub-folder for convenience.
```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.farms_1x1.clay_corn.farm import env
from farmgym.v2.farm import generate_video

import os
import time
time_tag = time.time()
os.mkdir(""run-"" + str(time_tag))
os.chdir(""run-"" + str(time_tag))

farm = env()

is_done = False
while not is_done:
    farm.render()
    obs, reward, is_done, info = farm.step(farm.action_space.sample())
generate_video(image_folder='.', video_name='farm.avi')
```

### Monitoring
A FarmGym environment typically comes with many states. It is possible for the developer to monitor such variables.
It is possible to do usingthe method farm.add_monitoring(var), where var is the list of considered variables.

### Complete gym example
We detail another way to try an environment below. 
The method register_all scans for all environments defined in farmgym and register them to gym.
It outputs the list of names of each environment. 
Then, the method run from  farmgym.v2.games.rungame runs a complete game,
collects rewards and costs, gather all rendered images if asked, and output all this in a sub-folder.
It also tests is the environment is compatible with gym.

```python
import gym
from farmgym.v2.games.register_all import register_all
from farmgym.v2.games.rungame import run_randomactions

env_list=register_all()

env = gym.make(env_list[2],100)
farm = env.unwrapped
run_randomactions(farm,max_steps=100,render=True, monitoring=False)
```

You can find further examples in the tests folder.

### Abstract:
The farm can be technologized with electronic innovation that constantly screens the states of crops, soil, and condition so the crops could be given watering and shed as required. The entirety of this can be controlled and observed online with the utilization of IoT and human-like intelligence can be added to it by training our model with our proposed algorithm. We will make a device that will be interfaced with a water pump and a shed to protect the garden from light and rain, controlled by a single-channel relay. The water siphon and shed are consequently controlled dependent on the estimations of the different natural elements like temperature, moistness, soil dampness, and light power which we can quantify through sensors like Temperature and Humidity sensor (DHT-11), Moisture sensor and LDR Light sensor. Through our research work, we will try to make the model intelligent by storing the previous scanned values in the database and doing the pre-perception based on historic values stored in the learning phase of the working model. We will be using a linear regression algorithm to train our model.

> FarmOS is a web-based application for farm management, planning, and record keeping. It is developed by a community of farmers, developers, researchers, and organizations with the aim of providing a standard platform for agricultural data collection and management.

 We use FarmOS for quickly interfacing with sensors and analyzing their big data 
```
git clone https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS.git
cd farmOS
sudo docker build -t farmos .
sudo docker run -p 80:80 -v ${PWD}/.data/www:/var/www/html farmos
```
You should refer to this [guide](https://farmos.org/development/docker/) on FarmOS official website for more details 
### Configure FarmOS
you can refer to this online [guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/install-farmos/) to help you configure FarmOS installation 
### Add weather station as a sensor on FarmOS
First make sure Sensor Module on FarmOS is enabled , you can enable and add module via the development branch (just really a super user on the local platform), if you're using a hosting service make sure to ask them to enable the sensors module.
### Install & Configure Arduino libraries 
Install the following libraries with your Arduino Library Manager in Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...SoftwareSerial
## Functional Weather Library
### DHT.h/DHT.CPP
you can refer to Adafruit [DHT](https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library) library for DHT doucmentation , however for some reason they don't read temperature & humidity together so we will be using dht.read function with data [] buffer in a new function called renew_temp_hu(DHT ,Float* ,Float*).
### Wind_auto.h/Wind_auto.cpp
built on two classes,	JSNR04T which is an interface class that provides an instance of JSNR04T ultrasonic chip in **Auto mode** , with the needed functions to use the device as wind measurement tool by using the divergence in reading ultrasonic measurements with self-corrected sound speed calculated from air temperature & humidity.
and wind class which preforms the mathematical logic on recorded data to output the needed weather details.

allmiss+=(WindX._aheadmiss+WindY._aheadmiss+WindZ._aheadmiss)*headecho_timeout;
allmiss+= _tempmiss;
//build the diagnostic or unit test according to your needs
```
### Timing 
The cron job activates the script every 10 minutes , the script Use grabserial to catch arduino serial for 30 seconds and restarts the count when it catches the JSON packet bracket and quit when the close bracket is seen while it takes the arduino 10 seconds (100 sample average) to record new readings, the cycle limit can be adopted by reducing the sampling rate.
script usage ( replace !public_key & !private_key with your sensor configuration
```
python3 /home/pi/grabserial/grabserial -d /dev/ttyACM0 -b 9600  -o /home/pi/serialtest.json  -e  30 -m ""^{.*"" -q ""}""

### :sparkles:About Fasaan
Agriculture is very significant in India's economy and jobs. Farmers' most prevalent problem is that they are unable to make informed decisions on which crops are supported in their areas, as well as market and profit prices. As a result, they have lower productivity and profit margins. The goal of this study is to propose an attempt to estimate agricultural output and price using machine learning, which will aid in crop selection based on soil type and meteorological conditions.

Farmers do not have a single point of contact for all of their needs, including crop, market price, soil type, government programs, and the latest news. To make this easier for farmers, a portal based on machine learning is being developed.
 
### :sparkles:About the Project 
Several studies were undertaken recently in India, including the one on DFI, have brought out the problems afflicting the agriculture sector. 

The recommendations of these studies include, inter alia, ensuring timely availability of inputs, an increased focus on measures to enhance the productivity - especially of small and marginal farms, adoption of modern agricultural practices, optimal use of inputs, choice of the right crops through macro and micro-level planning. FASAAN comes from the Hindi terms ""Fasal"" and ""Kisaan,"" which mean ""crops"" and ""farmers,"" respectively. As the name says, we work as a farmer's companion. Farmers play a critical role in both meeting our basic food needs and altering the agricultural environment. Farmers manage agricultural practices to maintain the long-term survival of the entire flora and fauna. 

Agriculture presently occupies one-third of the world's land surface. For a big majority of the world's population, it is the most essential activity since it produces food for people all over the world.

>
> The features include:
> 1. **Gain Insights** - Centralized source of truth for farmers to gain insights into their land. Our software allows farmers to optimally plan farm layouts and maximize efficiency and revenue.
> 2. **Plan Out Field** - The user is able to indicate plots of land where they want to plant and indicate the crop they want to plant there. Based on real-time data about air quality, soil and weather conditions,
> 3. **Real Time Analysis with Environment Impact** - Fasaan will determine how suitable a particular area is for planting a particular crop, and provide a general estimation on the expected value of a plot.
> 4. **Environment Degradation** - Fasaan would determine a Fasaan Score that would determine the degradation the particular farm field is creating because of the crops and irrigation sources
> 5. **AI Based Help** - Fasaan is AI based solution which makes it the best platform to suggest farmers crops and also given them suggestions about not-so-good combinations and crop rotation techniques
> 6. **Crop Yield and Estimation** - Fasaan will help ypu detrermine the growth of your formed field in the platform - how well it performs in all the 4 seasons.  This would help the farmers know about the estimated cost anf fundings to be taken beforehand.

Furthemore it aims to do that in an automatable way with the help of third party mods. For example with a Multi Farm from Forestry, Garden Cloche from Immersive Engineering, Plant Sower and Plant Gatherer from Industrial Foregoing and Phytogenic Insulator from Thermal Expansion.

![An image showing the mods logo](https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/logo_v3.png 'Floralis logo')

As soon as you travel around your world, you'll either find a new type of cactus or a new type of flower, depending on the biome you wander through. Cactus plants can be found in any desert type biome, while flower plants can be found in any other biome but not in desert type biomes. When you look around for a while, you'll see that there is one type of cactus and one type of flower for each type of dye. You'll find them every few chunks in small groups sorted by their color. But take care, the cacti might sting! Besides from looking pretty and attracting bees, they serve another useful purpose. Upon breaking one of either a cactus or flower, they'll drop two respective seeds depending on their plant type and color, one plant petal in their respective color and one plant fiber. Harvesting them with a pair of shears or a silk touch enchanted tool will drop the cactus or flower itself instead, for you to plant or pot it as decoration.

![An animated image showing the process of breaking a cactus and flower plant resulting in their drops spawning](https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/drops_plants.gif 'Plant drops')

If you're lucky enough, you'll find a village with one or more custom fields of either cacti or flowers, again depending on the biome the village is generated in. A field packed with cacti will only generate in desert type villages, while a field packed with flowers will only generate in any other biome but not in desert type biomes. A farmer villager near the field will offer you some trades to either get emeralds for seeds or to get plant petals for emeralds. The type of seeds the farmer villager will trade with you is again depending on the village type. Cactus seeds can only be obtained by farmer villager in desert type villages, while flower seeds can be obtained by farmer villager in any other village type but not in desert type villages.

![An animated image showing the mods villager trades](https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/trades.gif 'Villager trades')

The seeds you just have gotten are pretty straight forward to use, either plant cactus seeds on some sand or plant flower seeds on farmland. Give them time to grow to their full size, which will be indicated by the fully blooming blossom on top of the crop. You wont get back more than the one seed you used to plant the crop as long as they aren't fully grown. When fully grown, they'll drop two respective seeds depending on their plant type and color, one plant petal in their respective color and one plant fiber, just like their natural spawning counterparts. Harvesting them with a pair of shears or a silk touch enchanted tool will drop the cactus or flower itself instead, for you to plant or pot it as decoration. As long as a cactus crop isn't old enough to develop its thorns, it wont hurt you or any other entity.

To finally get the dye, just dry the petals in a furnace. The petals will be dried to their respectively colored dye counterpart.

![An animated image showing the process of drying petals in a furnace to retrieve their respectively colored dye counterpart](https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/smelting_petals.gif 'Petal drying')

In case you stock up too much dye, you can store it in compact storage blocks, one for each type of dye.

![An animated image showing the process of compressing dye to dye blocks](https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/crafting_compress_dye_block.gif 'Dye compression')

Of course you can reverse this progress to get the dye back out of their respective storage blocks.

Plant fibers can be used just like bone meal, to speed up the growth of crops, sow some grass and flowers, or use it as a fertilizer with third party mods. Just like with dye, there is a storage block in case you've piled up to much plant fibers.

![An image showing the process of compressing plant fiebers to plant fibers blocks](https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/crafting_compress_plant_fibers_block.png 'Fibers compression')

Of course you can reverse this progress to get the plant fibers back out of the storage block.

![An image showing the process of decompressing plant fibers blocks to plant fibers](https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/crafting_decompress_plant_fibers_block.png 'Fibers decompression')

Since all blocks and items in this mod are of natural origin, they can be composted using the composter, each type of block and item coming with a different chance of being composted, these are their respective values:

- Cactus: 65 %
- Flower: 65%
- Cactus Seeds: 30 %
- Flower Seeds: 30 %
- Petals: 30 %
- Plant Fibers: 30 %
- Plant Fibers Block: 85 %

The provided config file will let you adjust the way the mod generates its features. You can enable and disable independently whether cacti and flowers should get generated naturally, as well as enable and disbale whether cacti and flower fields should get generated in villages. You can enable and disable village field generation independently per village type. You can also adjust the rarity and density in which natural generating cacti and flowers occur.

You are allowed to use this mod in any modpack, as long as it's credited in some kind of modlist, in case the modpack is public.

1172,jang-seeder-wheel,Fordi,N/A,https://github.com/Fordi/jang-seeder-wheel,https://api.github.com/repos/Fordi/jang-seeder-wheel,OpenSCAD Jang Seed Roller,"# Parametric Seed Roller

This is a parametric seed roller with default parameters and presets for Jang JP or JPH series rollers.

<img src=""https://github.com/Fordi/jang-seeder-wheel/raw/main/Jang_F-12_PLA_Orange.jpg"" width=""320"" alt=""Jang F-12 sample print"" />

You can adjust things like the diameter and borehole to adjust for your printer's tolerances. You can also adjust the number of seed cells and their size.

I started from an existing Jang wheel, took measurements, and implemented a fully parameterized version out of shape primitives.  Then [fernplant](https://github.com/fernplant) was nice enough to add other shapes, and [mandrewcramer](https://github.com/mandrewcramer) helped with the text rendering.  You can thank [Peter Armstrong](https://github.com/peteretep) for making me aware of the J#-6 series (and if _you_ know of a roller that's not covered by a preset, please open an [issue](./issues); I will absolutely give a mention).

The renders of every roller preset are available [on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4462838).

# Usage

Running this command will open up OpenSCAD.  If you open up the Customizer, you'll see a bunch of presets for known Jang seed rollers.

```
openscad seed_roller.scad
```

The following command will render the preset ""Jang M-12"" as ""./stl/Jang M-12.stl"":

```bash
./render.sh ""Jang M-12""
```

To list all the presets:

```bash
./render.sh list
```

The current set of supported rollers are:


* Jang A-6
* Jang AA-6
* Jang B-12
* Jang BL-12
* Jang C-12
* Jang C-6
* Jang F-12
* Jang F-24
* Jang F-6
* Jang G-12
* Jang G-6

* Jang YYJ-6
* Jang YYX-12
* Jang YYX-24
* Jang YYX-36
* Jang Z-Blank

> \* These rollers are works in progress; see Issue #6

To render all the presets into `./stl/`.

```bash
./render.sh all
```

> Note: there are 57 rollers, and they each take about a minute to render, with more or more complex holes taking longer (though, render.sh works parallel up to the number of processors you have).  So you're looking at a nontrivial amount of render time, depedning on your machine.  Mine knocks everything out in about 11 minutes at 8-parallel.

## Windows users

You can grab a windows build of [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html), open `seed_roller.scad`, load the preset you want to render, and generate an STL from the UI.  

To generate _all_ the STL files on Windows, your easiest way would be to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).  Once you've done that, `render.bat` should work just as `render.sh` does (e.g., `render all` will start generating everything).  First run takes some time, as it needs to download the `openscad/openscad` image and install `jq`, but that only takes a minute or two.

As an aside, if you've got Docker installed on Linux or OS-X, `render.sh` will create the container there as well - so if you're having trouble running `render.sh`, installing docker will (essentially) fix the problem for you.

# SeansLifeArchive_Images_Hay-Day
The module for my life story project that contains my Hay Day Gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my weekly Hay Day session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.hayday&hl=en_US&gl=US)

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Hay Day all the way back in 2013. I started off with the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hay-day/id506627515).

I started playing the game again a few times, from 2013 to 2014, then from 2014 to 2018, then again in 2020.

The system is designed for small and private farming purposes which is held under unnatural light and temperature resources. 
It measures the temperature, light intensity and humidity of the interested plants, and gives warning in case that non-optimal conditions are detected for them.
By doing this, the system aims at providing the perfect artificial conditions for those plants to raise.

# Components:

> These are some of the important components in this app!

- **Image Gallery**
   - Very common gallery system needed in all apps.
- **Angular Animations**
  
<br>


## Image Gallery

The out of box and responsive image gallery made by modifing angular2-image-gallery.


To change the images in **[assets/img/gallery](https://github.com/JunkieLabs/treeform-angular-webapp/tree/master/src/assets/img/gallery)**.
Follow these steps.

- Install [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) in your system. 
- Add Images in any folder except gallery inside assets/img  folder.
- Craete command in pacakge.json file. For example

```json
    ""convert:newImages"": ""node ./image-convert.js --gName=newImages ./src/assets/img/newImages"",

```
- In above command newImages is a new folder. And [image-convert.js](https://github.com/JunkieLabs/treeform-angular-webapp/blob/master/image-convert.js) file is the script. After conversion one new folder will be there in assets/img/gallery.

<br>

## SCSS: Styling


> No CSS in any style related file ! The design is fully design using scss structure.



All the basic and common scss class has a prefix selector *tb-* to distinguish it from other angular material related classes. you can find the styles in [theme/tb](https://github.com/JunkieLabs/treeform-angular-webapp/tree/master/src/theme/tb)

<br>



<br>


# FAQ:

### Does this project require bootstrap?



>  No! There isn't a requirement of this library. The design is implemented only using angular material and SCSS styles.

Referenced in https://gamehacking.academy/lesson/4/4.

A hack for Flare version 1.12 that will automatically move the player towards the nearest enemy and then attack until the enemy is dead.

It accomplishes this through a thread that constantly compares the current player's X and Y position to an enemy's position. Depending on the position, the mouse cursor is then set to a certain angle and SendInput is used to send a mouse down event to the game.

After injecting this hack, go in game and hold down the ""M"" key. Your character will then begin running toward the closest enemy and begin attacking them.

This must be injected into the Flare process to work. One way to do this is to use a DLL injector. Another way is to enable AppInit_DLLs in the registry.

#### Context:
>India is a farming country. India is one of the major players in the agriculture sector worldwide and it is the primary source of livelihood for about 58% of India’s population. But India lacks actual scientific farming. This is due to the lack of access to scientific training and methods to the farmers. Scientific farming is a necessity in India, as it is the only way to ensure that the country’s agricultural sector can keep up with the ever-increasing demand for food. India is home to over 1.3 billion people, and with a population growth rate of 1.2%, it is estimated that by 2050, India will be home to 1.7 billion people. This means that the demand for food will continue to increase, and if India does not adopt scientific farming practices, it will be unable to meet this demand. So the adoption of scientific methods and modern approaches towards farming is extremely necessary.
#### Proposal:
>So, we propose KrishiSevak. KrishiSevak is a web app that guides farmers with proper scientific advice and recommendations using the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The farmer can simple open the website, fill in some details and allow location access. KrishiSevak suggests the most profitable and suitable crops to grow at the season, recommend pesticides necessary. If multiple crops can be cultivated, KrishiSevak will calculate annual profit on all possible crops based on the market price and present all the possible farming paths that can be taken in a dashboard format.
KrishiSevak would use machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources such as weather forecasts, soil conditions, crop prices, and other relevant information. It would then provide farmers with insights and tips on how to best manage their farms.",4,4,2,0,farming,"[farming, machine-learning, real-life-problems, service, web-application]",00000

<h1>ES410: Insight, Interface, Intelligence Warwick – Group 5</h1>
Low-Cost Smart Agricultural Sensing System for Small Holder Farms in South Asia

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to design a low-cost smart agricultural sensing system for small-scale farms in South Asia, specifically focused on rice crops. The system will include sensors that can measure the nitrogen levels in the soil, as well as a radio frequency transceiver that can transmit this data to a central hub for processing. This data will be displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI) using data analysis techniques, providing the farmer with valuable information about the health of their soil. Machine learning models will also be used to predict future soil health, which will also be displayed on the GUI.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
The main objectives of the project are:
	
- [x]  Research different options for sensors that can measure nitrogen levels in soil (WP1)
- [x]  Research different microcontrollers, displays, and machine learning models that can be used in the central hub (WP2)
- [x]  Design a printed circuit board (PCB) that can integrate the sensors, microcontrollers, RF transceiver, and power source (WP1 & WP2)
- [x]  Design a GUI that can take user input and clearly display data (WP2)
- [x]  Develop methods for analyzing sensor data and use machine learning techniques to identify patterns and predict soil health (WP3)
- [x]  Test the integrated system and provide a proof of concept of the design (WP2)
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>

- [x]  Construct a fully-working prototype of the system (All)
- [x]  Connect the system to Wi-Fi to receive external data, such as weather data, for improved machine learning (WP2 & WP3)
- [x]  Gather data from multiple sensors (e.g. temperature, humidity, moisture levels) and build an online database to store information from multiple sensor hubs. (WP2)
<h2>Project Description</h2>

<h3> What technologies were used </h3>

* Arduino IDE (C/ C++)
* Matlab 
* React Native (React JS)
* Altium 
* AutoDesk Fusion 360 


<h3> Challenges faced </h3>

* NPK is given the same values repeatedly (we are assuming it is not working)
* Due to the cost restrictions it is difficult to  accurately test the NPK sensor because that would require buying another NPK sensor
* Issues with MCU (only 2/3 boards work) which lead to a problems with RF testing (was resolved by changing the board)
* Issues converting MATLAB ML mode to C ( the MATLAB to C code result was trying to write into illegal memory)
* React-Native mobile App issue with pulishing (Unable to publish to expo without SDK error issue)
* React-Native mobile App requried a lot of non native libraries and dependancies which led to errors ( but still was preferable to Flutter because of knowlegde of javascript in the group) 
* Issue with running the app on the web because of react-native imports. A website in react Js is undevelopment.
* Issue with completion of mechanical goals - ...

</div>

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to use AI and open source technology to help poor farmers in India grow the best crops and fertilize like a pro. Our tool provides reliable and accessible recommendations based on local soil and weather conditions, helping farmers optimize their crop yields and improve their economic livelihoods.

<div align=""center"">
<img src=""/assets/farmers.jpg"" width=""65%""/>
</div>

By using open source technologies, we also hope to foster a community of farmers and developers who can collaborate and continuously improve the accuracy and utility of the tool. Let's use the power of AI and open source principles to empower poor farmers in India and beyond!

## Project Workflow
Below are some of the stages of this project for sucessfull development and deployment of both frontend and backend services.

- Data Collection & ML model training
    - In this stage we collect the required training/testing datasets for building the crop & fertilizer recommendation models. Find training notebook [here.](https://github.com/deepeshdm/CropFusionAI-Backend/tree/main/notebooks)
- Backend Deployment of ML model API's
    - Once we have build the ML models we deploy and expose them as API. In our case, we have opted for FastAPI for building the backend services [here](https://github.com/deepeshdm/CropFusionAI-Backend)
- Frontend Interface with 3D model
    - Once the backend has been setup , we create a user friendly frontend application with ReactJS, so that even non-technical people can easily interact with the ML models.

This is a simple but highly effective JavaScript local web browser ran high yield farmbot that has a built-in stop loss function the second volatility is detected it pulls from the yield and sells in usdc ""ERC20"". If you have it set to bnb it will sell to busd , if it's set for the polygon at work it sells into a pegged usdc. USDC was a stable coin chosen because it's the only one back 100% dollar for dollar. 

After the volatility subsides it sells the stable coin and goes back to yield farming, this algorithm of selling before volatility and buying in when volatility subsides greatly increases profit and holdings of the primary coin. 

I made this video tutorial on how to configure it and run it.

The best part the more volatility the more it seems to profit.

Let’s get started.

Part 1. Main software installations.

Extract the Max-yield-farmer-with-stablecoin-stoploss.zip anywhere thats easily accessible to you.

Part 2. Edit the settings.

Open the unzip folder find the ""config.js"" file and open it with a text editor:

1.Set your wallet address and private key or your wallet seed if you have a wallet that does not give you the private key

2.Set the ""networks""  1 = ETH , 2 = BNB , 3 = polygon 

3.Set the ""maxspend"" max amount you want to uses in the address you provided ""make sure you have the amount in your wallet you provided or it will error out"" 


Want to thank me my eth/bnb/polygon address is 0x2431bec69aa4699ad9A9aE77233F7bdcD6d631f8

This is a Smart Farming solution that involves the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help farmers mitigate the effects of climate change. Traditional agricultural practices have increasingly become ineffective due to unpredicatable climate change, thus leading to a decrease in food production. This solution uses wireless sensors to remotely monitor farm components such as soil quality, water supply and weather data. Artificial intelligence is then used to analyse the data and provide farmers with actionable intelligence on how best to improve their farming practices in an effort to raise the quality of the yield and increase food production under the given circumstances.

## Theory

### What is yield farming?

At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to lock up their holdings, which in turn provides them with rewards.

**In brief:**

- Yield farming lets you lock up funds, providing rewards in the process.
- It involves lending out cryptos via DeFi protocols in order to earn fixed or variable interest.
- The rewards can be far greater than traditional investments, but higher rewards bring higher risks, especially in such a volatile market.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22610163/118402446-91963780-b672-11eb-9574-12e19fb789f9.png"" | width=720>
</p>

## Application Software Architecture

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22610163/104122166-729a3880-5354-11eb-9088-5123e47990d2.png"" | width=720>
</p>

Here is the application software architecture work-flow:
- Users use an Internet browser to connect front-end application which is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
- Then, instead of accessing a back-end server, the website talks directly to the blockchain which is where all the codes and data for the application lives. 
- The DeFi application codes are contained in smart contracts written in solidity progrramming language which was a lot like JavaScript. These smart contracts are immutable which means the code can not change and all the data is stored in the public ledger which is also immutable. And, anytime new data is added to the blockchain, it will be permanent and publicly verifiable.

## Installation

### Setup

- **Node.js**

A Minecraft Bedrock Tool to prevent you from going AFK (and getting kicked)

**It's easy to use and 100% effective. And it's completely safe.**

## How to use

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/patrickpissurno/bedrock-afk/releases/latest/download/BedrockAFK.exe)
2. Launch Minecraft Windows 10 Edition (it's the one from Microsoft Store, not the Java one)
3. Open **BedrockAFK** and choose one of the available modes (eg. Walk Forward)
4. Switch back to the game and enjoy

Once you're done with it, just head back to **BedrockAFK** and close the app.

### Notice
It is required that the game window be active (focused) for this tool to work, which means **you can't minimize the game and do something else while AFK on Minecraft**. While this is unfortunate, AFAIK there's no workaround for that due to the way Minecraft Bedrock and all other UWP apps work.

<br>

## How does it work
Under the hood **BedrockAFK** calls the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) APIs so that it can simulate keyboard and mouse presses on Minecraft. Due to the way it's implemented, it's virtually indistinguishable from actual user input.

<br>

## Available modes
1. Walk Forward (every now and then simulates the 'W' key being pressed)
2. Water Bucket (intended to be used with a water bucket, simulating the right mouse button)
3. AFK Fishing (fast) (intended to be used with an AFK fishing contraption, such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvsvFrILXJY))
4. AFK Fishing (slow) (same as above, but useful when not using a lure-enchanted fishing rod)

<br>

## Requirements
- Minecraft Windows 10 Edition (a.k.a. the Microsoft Store one)
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 (you shouldn't need to download it if you have Windows 10 1803 or later)
- Windows 10

This plugin adds an enchantment for hoes that automatically replants seeds when harvesting, making farming more efficient.

## Installation

* Download the latest version here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/replenish-enchantment.107292/
* Drag the .jar into your plugins/ folder
* Reboot your server
* Set up the config.yml and language.yml located in the /plugins/ReplenishEnchantment/ directory

## Usage

### Commands
* `/r-get BOOK` - gives you an Enchanted Book with the Replenish Enchantment on it
* `/r-give BOOK <Player>` - gives \<Player> an Enchanted Book with the Replenish Enchantment on it
* `/r-get HOE <Material> [<full-enchanted>]` - gives you a Hoe of the Material \<Material> with the Replenish Enchantment on it. When \<full-enchanted> is set and is true the hoe will also be enchanted with
    - Efficiency V
    - Fortune III
    - Mending
    - Unbreaking III
* `/r-give HOE <Player> <Material> [<full-enchanted>]` - gives \<Player> a Hoe of the Material \<Material> with the Replenish Enchantment on it. \<full-enchanted> works just like above
* `/r-get AXE <Material> [<full-enchanted>]` - gives you an Axe of the Material \<Material> with the Replenish Enchantment on it. \<full-enchanted> works just like above
* `/r-give AXE <Player> <Material> [<full-enchanted>]` - gives \<Player> an Axe of the Material \<Material> with the Replenish Enchantment on it. \<full-enchanted> works just like above

### Permissions
The Permissions can be viewed and edited in the config.yml located in the /plugins/ReplenishEnchantment/ directory

### Messages
The Messages can be viewed and edited in the language.yml located in the /plugins/ReplenishEnchantment/ directory

### Ingame
* Get the Enchanted Book via the commands above
* Apply the Enchantment onto a hoe, this can be done,
    - by combining a hoe or axe, with the Enchanted Book on an anvil (if enabled in the config.yml)
    - by dragging the Enchanted Book onto a hoe or axe in the inventory and clicking it in survival mode (if enabled in the config.yml)
* Or just get a hoe or axe with a command from above.
* Destroy some crops with this hoe or axe.

The enchantment only works in survival mode!

Currently, there is no way to get the enchantment in survival yet, but you can add your own ones.
Here are some examples:
* A Villager who trades a book and 32 emeralds for the enchanted book: 
    ````
    /summon minecraft:villager ~ ~ ~ {VillagerData:{type:plains,profession:farmer,level:2},Offers:{Recipes:[{buy:{id:book,Count:1},buyB:     {id:emerald,Count:32},sell:{id:enchanted_book,Count:1,tag:{StoredEnchantments:[{id:""replenishenchantment:replenish"",lvl:1}],display:{Lore:   ['[{""text"":""Replenish"",""italic"":false,""color"":""gray""}]']}}}}]}}
    ````
* You could also just add the Enchanted Book, or an enchanted tool to a Shopkeepers shop, if you have the [Shopkeepers](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/shopkeepers.80756/) plugin installed.
* A Citizens NPC giving an Enchanted Book to the players every 15 minutes
  - first create a npc with ``/npc create <name>``
  - configure it just like you want it to be, for more information about Citizens look [here](https://wiki.citizensnpcs.co/Citizens_Wiki)
  - add the command like this:
    
    ``/npc cmd add r-get BOOK -o --cooldown 900``

## API

### Include the API:
Add this to your pom.xml:
````xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>de.drachir000.survival</groupId>
    <artifactId>replenishenchantment</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
````

### Using the API
First you have to get an Instance of the REAPI class.
```java
REAPI api = REAPI.getAPI();
```
* #### Registering your own custom enchantments
This Plugin overwrites the vanilla anvil mechanics. If you want your own custom enchantments to have level costs without your users having to register them manually in the config.yml you can do it as following:
````java
// Get the api like above

Enchantment custom_enchantment = // ... your custom enchantment

int itemModifier = 2;
int bookModifier = 1;

api.registerEnchantment(custom_enchantment, itemModifier, bookModifier);
````
The multipliers times the final level of the enchantment gives the level cost of this enchantment while combining two items on the anvil. The book-modifier is used when the right item is an enchantment book, the item-modifier otherwise.
In this case the itemModifier is 2 and the bookModifier 1. You can modify this just as you wish or let your users configure it. When you want to change this values just call this method with the new values again.

* #### Getting the Enchanted Book or an Enchanted Hoe
If you want to give your players the Enchanted Book, or directly an enchanted hoe or axe, you can use the `buildBook()`, `buildHoe()` or `buildHoe()` method which returns an ItemStack depending on the arguments.
````java
// Get the api like above

Material hoeMaterial = // ... The Material of the Hoe (must be a hoe)
Material axeMaterial = // ... The Material of the Axe (must be a axe)
boolean fullEnchanted = // ... Whether the hoe or axe should have Efficiency V, Fortune III, Mending and Unbreaking III. If you only want some of theese you have to add them yourself.

ItemStack book = api.buildBook();
ItemStack hoe = api.buildHoe(hoeMaterial, fullEnchanted);
ItemStack axe = api.buildAxe(axeMaterial, fullEnchanted);

player.getInventory.addItem(book, hoe, axe);
````

* #### Other Item Utils
    - Applying the Enchantment:
    ````java
    // Get the api like above
    
    ItemStack item = // ...
    
    api.applyEnchantment(item); // For hoes and axes
    api.addStoredEnchant(item); // For enchantment storages like enchanted books
    
    // Do what ever you want with your enchanted Item
    ````
    - Checking for the Enchantment:
    ````java
    // Get the api like above
    
    ItemStack item = // ...
    
    if (isEnchanted(item)) { // For hoes and axes
    if (hasStoredEnchant(item)) { // For enchantment storages like enchanted books
    
        // Do what ever you want with your enchanted Item
    
    }
    ````
    - Get the Enchantment
    ````java
    // Get the api like above
    
    Enchantment replenish_enchantment = api.getEnchantment();
    
    // Do what ever you want with the Replenish Enchantment
    ````
    - Updating the lore
    ````java
    // Get the api like above
    
    ItemStack item = // ...
    
    api.updateLore(item);
    
    // Do what ever you want with your item
    ````

## Problems 

One of the significant issues in organic farming is that certifications are required from multiple parties for
the products to be deemed ‘organic’. Currently, there are two government sanctioned mechanisms
for issuance of certification:

1. PGS Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS): Farmers in a group inspect each other’s land
and vouch for its organic credentials. The inspection is carried out at the start of every sowing
season and farmers visit each other almost weekly to provide counsel. If a farmer is found
to be in violation, her produce is not sold through the group till she rectifies her mistake.

2. Third party certification: The farms is certified by authorized third party certifying agencies.
The database of India’s organic products is very poor and traceability, which is key for export growth,
remains weak, while third party certification as insisted by APEDA is very costly. In addition, major
markets for export do not accepts PGS certification, and there is no mechanism to link certifications
by third parties and PGS. 

## Solution

GreenTrust offers a solution for obtaining certification in organic farming by organizing credible and decentralized Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGSs). 

In order to secure certification, every harvest must be sponsored by certified farmers who contribute a stake as a form of assurance that organic farming methods have been properly implemented. 

The platform utilizes decentralized IoT sensor data to monitor and track various environmental conditions. Additionally, any individual may challenge the organic authenticity of a particular harvest on the platform. 

These challenges are then evaluated by a certified inspector, and if the challenge is deemed to be valid, the challenger will receive the stake put forward for the harvest.

Conversely, if the challenge is found to be invalid, the challenger will lose the stake they put forward to initiate the challenge.

### 

#### Farmer
-  A Farmer joins the GreenTrust Platform for using the decentralized PGS system of verification for his organic Crops.
-  The user experience of the farmers is simplified by providing a PWA.
-  This provides him a platform to gain credibility for his crops without paying high third party certification fees. (Incentive)
-  In doing so, a farmer pays a nominal subscription fee in terms of Superfluid's CFA (Continuous Flow Agreement) money streaming model. (Future work)
-  The farmer can request stakes to be placed on his farm by stakeholders by clicking on Request Stake button, which sends a Push Notification to everyone subscribed to the GreenTrust Channel. (Future work)
  
#### Verifier
- A Verifier is an authorized Organic Crop Verifier associated with our platform.
- The Verifier will get allocated with inspecting a Challenged Crop randomly through our system. (Future Work)
- Since the Crop challenges will be randomly allocated the bias in the verifier's judgement will be highly reduced.
- Verifier can either approve or reject a challenge after inspecting the challenged crop.
- Verifier always gets the same amount (his inspection fee) irrespective of his decision which reduces his bias further.(Incentive)
 
#### Stakeholder 
- A Stakeholder is a person who vouches for the credibility of an organic crop by placing a certain amount as stake.
- After a certain duration from the crop's harvest, the stake amount will be returned to all the stakeholders and a reward will be given using Superfluid's IDA (Instant Distribution Agreement) model automatically using Chainlink Upkeep. (Future work, Incentive)
- Stakeholder's Rewards are generated from the farmer's subscriptions.
- If a challenge on the crop is approved by a verifier, then the stakeholder loses his stake amount.
 
#### Consumer
- Consumer is the one who consumes the farmer's organic products.
- The organic products will have QR codes which can be scanned to access the Crop details like Crop Health data (Uploaded through an IoT device), Challenges on the crop, stakeholders, etc.
- The consumer can challenge an organic crop harvest's credibility by placing a challenge and staking a certain amount.
- If the verifier approves the challenge, the Stakeholders' stakes are transferred to the consumer as a compensation amount and his stake (the one he placed to challenge) is transferred to the Verifier as a fee. (Incentive)
- If the verifier rejects the challenge, the consumer loses his staked amount to the Verifier (as a fee).

## Advantages

- <b>Establishing traceability</b>: Placing information regarding the lifecycle of crops on a
blockchain will help improving trust in the self certification process and establishing
traceability at the point of sale.

- <b>Disintermediation of multiple stakeholders</b>: As highlighted, the process of third party
certification is often expensive, and in turn drives up cost of produce, making it harder for
farmers to sell. Disintermediation through peer to peer certification mechanisms, or
integration of third party certifiers into the PGS process would unlock large markets for
produce and reduce cost of production.

- <b> Programmable transfers </b>: Much like in supply chain, tracking of products using IoT devices
along their value chain can help increase efficiency in transfer of asset between
stakeholders, and alert stakeholders immediately of issues.

## Plots Move Tool - Single Temporary Final Destination
Automate your plot transfer from temporary final folder to farming folder - support both local and remote. 
NO MORE troubles on stop/start plotting tool or keep changing config.yaml, NO MORE troubles on staring at farming drive space availability as you will be notified via Discord; set your plotting tool to infinite, whenever PRIMARY destination is full, it will transfer to BACKUP destination, you only need to edit remote.sh to add/change target destination.

***YOU MUST HAVE rclone, tmux/screen (optional) installed and a Discord Webhook***

## HOW TO USE?
***PLEASE DO A CLEAN INSTALLATION IF YOU ARE UPGRADING FROM V1.0 - SEE BELOW***
1) `git clone https://github.com/TaijiMonster/plots-move.git`
2) `cd plots-move`
3) `cp remote.sh.default remote.sh`
4) `cp discord.sh.default discord.sh`
5) Edit `nano remote.sh`, simple self explanatory notes in the file
6) Edit `nano discordALERT.sh`, put in your own Discord webhook
7) `sudo chmod +x *.sh`
8) Create a new tmux/screen session [OPTIONAL]
9) Start the transfer `./upload.sh`

## Clean Installation from V1.0
1) `rm -rf ~/plots-move`
2) `git clone https://github.com/TaijiMonster/plots-move.git`
3) `cd plots-move`
4) `cp remote.sh.default remote.sh`
5) `cp discord.sh.default discord.sh`
6) Edit `nano remote.sh`, simple self explanatory notes in the file
7) Edit `nano discordALERT.sh`, put in your own Discord webhook
8) `sudo chmod +x *.sh`
9) Create a new tmux/screen session [OPTIONAL]
10) Start the transfer `./upload.sh`

## Things to Note
1) You DO NOT need to setup/create a rclone configuration
2) Moving of transfer of plot will move to BACKUP destination when PRIMARY destination ran out of space or is less than required K size plot space you chosen in remote.sh
3) Only one plot will be transfer/move at anytime/per rclone session
4) Discord notification will not stop if you do not set a BACKUP destination folder
5) If PRIMARY destination folder ran out of space, Discord will send you 5 notifications, make sure you have a BACKUP destination entered in remote.sh
6) Please DO NOT enable your destination folder in config.yaml until it is fully filled with plots else it will affect your farming read time, YOU MIGHT BE LOSING REWARDS!

Let me know if there's any issue.

#### A program for keeping track of bales that you have fed

# Install

To install:

```shell
$ go install github.com/unclassedpenguin/bales@latest
```

Then, you need to create the config file at `~/.config/bales/config.yaml`

### Example ~/.config/bales/config.yaml

```yaml
# Database dir is the directory you want to store your databases in.
# It can be a git repo, but doesn't have to be...
# This directory must be created by the user
DatabaseDir: /home/username/git/databases

# RealDatabase is the legit database
# This will be created if it doesn't exist
RealDatabase: balesDatabase.db

# TestDatabase is a database you can use to test features
# This will be created if it doesn't exist
TestDatabase: balesTestDatabase.db

```

Don't forget to edit the DatabaseDir to where you want to store the databases. You just have to create the folder, the databases will be created if they don't exist.

For further documentation checkout [docs.unclassed.ca/bales](https://docs.unclassed.ca/bales)


## To-do:
  
  - If you try to list with month first then year, it doesn't work. Has to be year first then month. ? ie `bales -l -m 09 -year 2022` will give you all entries that match the month, however to properly get only the month and year you have to use `bales -l -year 2022 -m 09`
  - Add ""-most"" i.e. ""bales -most day"" to list the day that you fed the most bales. Do maybe day/month/year?
  - If you try to list for the current month, it gives the default ""There are no results for that query""
    Should probably change this so it says no entries for current month. Try -all or something.
  - Change checkdate functions so they return an error instead of bool. will need a bit of reformating. 
  - Add ""-to"". So you can do bales -l -from 2022-08-01 -to 2023-04-01
  - Add license?
  - Add ability to list based on ID number, singular or range (1 or 1-5)
    - Do I need this? I'm sure I wanted it for some reason...I'm not sure I want to put it in though. 
  - Add ""-between"" to list dates between one and another
  - Add an ability to get average. For square/round. Maybe by group as well. For daily weekly monthly?
    - Think this will be slightly more complicated than I originally thought...  
  - ~~On basic list (-l) it shows only current month. It however, still shows for all years. Need to make it show only current month of current year.~~

#### v0.3.6

  - ~~Possibly add Notes column?~~
    - I tried this. Would basically need me to restart the database. I don't think its worth it. It really messes with the formatting when listing...Just doesn't seem worth it at this point.
  - ~~Change -dateoton and -datentoo to -asc and -dec~~
  - ~~Add ""-today"" to list only for the current day~~
  - ~~When you mess up the -day flag, it still says something about month~~

#### v0.3.4

  - ~~Add ""checkMonth"" and ""checkYear"" Functions that do a regex and make sure it is 2 digits and 4 digits. Use when for -month and -year to confirm they are valid. Month could also be checked to make sure it is between 1 and 12.~~
    - Added ""CheckYear"", ""CheckMonth"", and ""CheckDay"" to functions.
  - ~~Remove sql string by default. Add flag to show it. I don't think most people would care to see what the query is.~~
  - ~~Make default list only list the current month. add -all flag to show entire database~~
    - Do I actually want this? Hmm...
    - I tried to implement this, I didn't like it. Instead I added a flag (-m) that lists only current month. It conflicts with -month, so you can't use them together. 
  - ~~Add Ability to delete groups. Maybe add a comfirmation ""Are you sure you want to delete group cows? (y or n)""~~  

#### v.0.3.3  

  - ~~Add ability for ""or"" to group. So command line would be ""-g ""cows or sheep"""", but it would split it to sql: ""animalgroup='cows' OR animalgroup='sheep'""~~
  - ~~Add sort by days (similar to years and months) where it can be a specific day or a range...~~
  - ~~Restructure code so its not all stuck in main~~
    - I split off all of the functions at least. I'm not sure if any of the main function can be split off? 
  - ~~Add datefrom function. Maybe -from. So you can list only from a specific date.~~
  - ~~Add ability to sort by date oldest/newest newest/oldest~~
  - ~~Add check for config file, if not, prompt user to make the config file at \~/.config/bales~~
  - ~~I'd like to add a config file and store the database somewhere separate(referenced by the config file), and then put it on github maybe? Although then the database would be specific to a computer and you would have to worry about backing it up/sharing it on your own...Something to think about.~~
    - I think this would work. Make a separate folder for the database(also a git folder), and make that the folder that bales -push and -pull works on. So it still updates the database, can still sync the database between computers, and not share the private data...
  - ~~Add -date to list function, so you can see on a specific day what you used...After the work I did to rewrite the list function, it should be fairly easy to add more features like this.~~
  - ~~Rewrite the list function. Make it so that you can add things together. If you say group, it tags onto the select * from bales statement ""where animalgroup="" and then if you ad more it says ""and so and so""...It should work.~~
  - ~~Add check to date if entered to make sure it is actually a date and not some random string...Regex?~~
  - ~~Add ability to send custom sql command to list.~~
  - ~~Add flag to pull/push from git to update database~~
    - Finally got this figured out...
  - ~~Add ability to get entries from date range. Maybe separate by year/month. Individual or range. Have to be year and month....~~
    - This is implemented somewhat, although probably done poorly. Not sure how to organize it...it works, but I'm sure there are lots of weird errors if you don't enter it how it expects. 
  - ~~Look into flag to see if you can add a description for -h. Add more info to help~~
  - ~~Add ability to list only a specific group. i.e. bales -l -g bulls would query everything for just bulls~~
  - ~~Add ability to get a total count for all | square/round | specific group.~~
  - ~~Add ability to get total count for square or round bales~~

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation ""Digital Restrictions Management"" instead of the more known ""Digital Rights Management"" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling ""Digital Restrictions Management"" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

Green Wall is a modular approach to soilless vertical farming. It takes advantage of fogponics (usage of fog in farming) and the Internet of Things to increase efficiency & crop yield while limiting waste output to solve traditional resource-intensive farming.

## Inspiration
Food security is an imperative global issue. Under threat by an increasingly unpredictable climate, growing populations, rising prices, and inadequate transportation infrastructure, we have yet to figure out how to keep everyone fed. Inspired and challenged by the ideals of the Solar Decathlon Middle East competition, the Green Wall aims to make food more local and personal by introducing food production into the built environment, complementing the urban desire for efficiency and individuality. Our motivation is to challenge the notion that all food production must occur as a detached and remote process to consumers living in cities.

## How it works?
The system takes advantage of fogponics and the Internet of Things to increase growth efficiency and crop yield while decreasing energy usage and waste output. It's capable of continuously & autonomously monitoring the plants’ growth cycles for delivering nutrients precisely and providing an optimal amount of light to save energy. The modular design of the vertical farming units allow the system to be used both on an individual basis or scaled up to a commercial level. The system can grow 1.5 kg of produce in a week using 2 liters of water, about 50 times more water efficient than conventional farming. Fog is used as the medium for delivering nutrients and water to plants. The system is flexible so that different plant combinations can be easily grown by adjusting the distance between the growing boxes. They can be stacked to increase growth capacity and each column communicates with each other for sharing and optimizing the resources available.

## How it is different?
Other vertical farming solutions are designed as inflexible megastructures, whether they come in the form of fixed racks of plants or remodelled shipping containers. On the contrary, the Green Wall allows vertical farming to occur at home or industrial campus, emphasizing the ability to resize and reshape, as well as allowing for the option to share data across communities local or international. Moreover, the Green Wall was developed to be equipped with replaceable and widely known components, eliminating any reliance on proprietary hardware or software. This allows for the system to be rebuilt with a completely different set of suppliers without any compromise in functionalities, championing adaptability. In short, the Green Wall is clean farming made modular and decentralized.

======================================

Program to calculate crossbreadings between your clones inside the game RUST of FacePunch Studios.
Copy the genes of your clones, select the desired result, and press CALCULATE.
It can be used with Hemp, Corn, Pumpkins, and the recently added multicolor Berries.
Since it is implemented in JavaScript, there is no need of installing any software in your system.
No relation with FacePunch Studios here.

Try it at: [https://alierum.github.io/](https://alierum.github.io/).

User manual: [https://github.com/alierum/alierum.github.io/wiki/XBreeding-Manual](https://github.com/alierum/alierum.github.io/wiki/XBreeding-Manual).


Interaction with other programs
-------------------------------

To recieve parameters from other programs, use the url (via GET).

Parameters (begining with **?** and concatenated using **&**):

- **e**: experiment name, e.g. `c=hemp` (maximum 10 characters)
- **c**: clone list, e.g. `c=yyxxhygghywy` (groups of 6 characters)
- **t**: target, e.g. `t=yyyggg` (same as `t=gygygy`)
- **f**: filters, e.g. `f=w` or `f=x` or `f=wx`
- **g**: go, launches the calculation, e.g. `g` (same as `g=something`)

For example:

[https://alierum.github.io/?e=hemp&c=yyxgyygygwgghhggygggyhwhwhgghhyyghyh&t=yyyggg&f=x&g](https://alierum.github.io?e=hemp&c=yyxgyygygwgghhggygggyhwhwhgghhyyghyh&t=yyyggg&f=x&g).

TO DO:
------
- Autosplit the clone list while typing.
- Different planter configuration: 3 and 9.
- Autoajust page height to different screen sizes.
- Saving and recovering clone lists in the user's browser local storage.
- Check to show all results.
- Check to show/hide tooltips.
- Iterative stoppable process showing the best result found so far using several generations.

Proof of concept for running a nonprofit type of organization on Ethereum blockchain.

### Quickstart

#### Running:

#### Contracts development:

- Run ganache: `http://localhost:8545` -> this is defined in [truffle configuration](ethereum/truffle-config.js)
- Run truffle console: `truffle console`
- In truffle console: `compile`, `test` and `migrate`
- Or use npm scripts for that:
  - `npm run solhint`
  - `npm run prettier`
  - `npm run compile`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run migrate`
  - `npm run console`
- Interact with contract in truffle console:
  - `npm run console`
  - ```javascript
    let instance = await DaoToken.deployed();
    let tokenAddress = instance.address;
    let accounts = await web3.eth.getAccounts();
    ```
- Interact with contract using contract ABI json and Web3 library

#### Web development:

- Change [Web3 provider URI](client/src/providers/web3.js) (default provider is ganache `http://localhost:8545`)
- Replace contract ABI json after [build](#contract-development) from [build folder](ethereum/) to [client/src/providers/abi folder](client/src/providers/abi)
- Replace contract addresses after deployment in [vue store](client/src/store/index.js)
- `cd client`
- `npm run serve`

## dependencies
The following JavaScript files need to be added to the ""lib"" directory:
* [jQuery v2.2.1](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.1.js) or any other compatible version (as **lib/jquery.js**).
* [jQuery.path v0.0.1](https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path) or any other compatible version (as **lib/jquery.path.js**).
* [FastClick Polyfill v1.0.1](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) or any other compatible version as (**lib/fastclick.js**).

Additionally, [Cordova@9.0.0](https://cordova.apache.org/) is required to build the project to a native mobile app, and the following plugins are used:
* [StatusBar](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar)
* [NativeStorage](https://github.com/TheCocoaProject/cordova-plugin-nativestorage)
* [ExitApp](https://github.com/gaqzi/cordova-plugin-exitapp)
* [YANAP](https://github.com/Wizcorp/cordova-plugin-yanap)

If running the game natively in your computer's browser, Cordova and these plugins aren't needed, but not all features may not be fully functional.

The Cordova project files are not included in this repository, but creating a new project, including the above plugins, and putting the contents of this repo in the **www** path should get the job done.

## compatibility
Crop Drop for Android was confirmed to work on Android OS versions 4, 6, and 7, on Samsung, Motorola, LG, and Google phones. The web-app version should run on almost all browsers with some quirks. Confirmed browsers:
* Firefox (tested on Windows 8.1; browser v53): **A-OK.**
* Chrome (tested on Windows 8.1, browser v57): **minor graphical quirks; major quirks when built from Cordova instead of just grabbing things from the _www_ folder, using the browser zoom function is recommended.**
* Chrome Mobile (tested on Android OS 6, v55): **A-OK.**
* Chrome Mobile (tested on iOS): **minor graphical quirks**
* Safari Mobile (tested on iOS): **minor graphical quirks**
* Waterfox Mobile (tested on Android): **minor graphical quirks**
* Firefox Mobile (tested on Android OS 6, v53): **_Completely unplayable._**

## why
I developed [Amicom](https://github.com/HauntedBees/Amicom), a virtual pet, and I found myself playing and enjoying one of the mini-games in it more than the rest of the game, so I decided to just branch that out into a more fleshed out project of its own.

## Problems 

One of the significant issues in organic farming is that certifications are required from multiple parties for
the products to be deemed ‘organic’. Currently, there are two government sanctioned mechanisms
for issuance of certification:

1. PGS Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS): Farmers in a group inspect each other’s land
and vouch for its organic credentials. The inspection is carried out at the start of every sowing
season and farmers visit each other almost weekly to provide counsel. If a farmer is found
to be in violation, her produce is not sold through the group till she rectifies her mistake.

2. Third party certification: The farms is certified by authorized third party certifying agencies.
The database of India’s organic products is very poor and traceability, which is key for export growth,
remains weak, while third party certification as insisted by APEDA is very costly. In addition, major
markets for export do not accepts PGS certification, and there is no mechanism to link certifications
by third parties and PGS. 

## Solution

GreenTrust offers a solution for obtaining certification in organic farming by organizing credible and decentralized Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGSs). 

In order to secure certification, every harvest must be sponsored by certified farmers who contribute a stake as a form of assurance that organic farming methods have been properly implemented. 

The platform utilizes decentralized IoT sensor data to monitor and track various environmental conditions. Additionally, any individual may challenge the organic authenticity of a particular harvest on the platform. 

These challenges are then evaluated by a certified inspector, and if the challenge is deemed to be valid, the challenger will receive the stake put forward for the harvest.

Conversely, if the challenge is found to be invalid, the challenger will lose the stake they put forward to initiate the challenge.

### 

#### Farmer
-  A Farmer joins the GreenTrust Platform for using the decentralized PGS system of verification for his organic Crops.
-  The onboarding of Farmers is simplified by using Arcana Auth which provides a seamless interface from Web2 to Web3.
-  This provides him a platform to gain credibility for his crops without paying high third party certification fees. (Incentive)
-  In doing so, a farmer pays a nominal subscription fee in terms of Superfluid's CFA (Continuous Flow Agreement) money streaming model.
-  The farmer can request stakes to be placed on his farm by stakeholders by clicking on Request Stake button, which sends a Push Notification to everyone subscribed to the GreenTrust Channel.
  
#### Verifier
- A Verifier is an authorized Organic Crop Verifier associated with our platform.
- The Verifier will get allocated with inspecting a Challenged Crop randomly through our system. (Future Work)
- Since the Crop challenges will be randomly allocated the bias in the verifier's judgement will be highly reduced.
- Verifier can either approve or reject a challenge after inspecting the challenged crop.
- Verifier always gets the same amount (his inspection fee) irrespective of his decision which reduces his bias further.(Incentive)
 
#### Stakeholder 
- A Stakeholder is a person who vouches for the credibility of an organic crop by placing a certain amount as stake.
- After a certain duration from the crop's harvest, the stake amount will be returned to all the stakeholders and a reward will be given using Superfluid's IDA (Instant Distribution Agreement) model automatically using Chainlink Upkeep. (Incentive)
- Stakeholder's Rewards are generated from the farmer's subscriptions by the smart contract deployed on Polygon.
- If a challenge on the crop is approved by a verifier, then the stakeholder loses his stake amount.
 
#### Consumer
- Consumer is the one who consumes the farmer's organic products.
- The organic products will have QR codes which can be scanned to access the Crop details like Crop Health data (Uploaded through an IoT device), Challenges on the crop, stakeholders, etc.
- The consumer can challenge an organic crop harvest's credibility by placing a challenge and staking a certain amount.
- If the verifier approves the challenge, the Stakeholders' stakes are transferred to the consumer as a compensation amount and his stake (the one he placed to challenge) is transferred to the Verifier as a fee. (Incentive)
- If the verifier rejects the challenge, the consumer loses his staked amount to the Verifier (as a fee).

## Advantages

- <b>Establishing traceability</b>: Placing information regarding the lifecycle of crops on a
blockchain will help improving trust in the self certification process and establishing
traceability at the point of sale.

- <b>Disintermediation of multiple stakeholders</b>: As highlighted, the process of third party
certification is often expensive, and in turn drives up cost of produce, making it harder for
farmers to sell. Disintermediation through peer to peer certification mechanisms, or
integration of third party certifiers into the PGS process would unlock large markets for
produce and reduce cost of production.

- <b> Programmable transfers </b>: Much like in supply chain, tracking of products using IoT devices
along their value chain can help increase efficiency in transfer of asset between
stakeholders, and alert stakeholders immediately of issues.

# Summary
A simple timer program intended for, but not limited to, use for timing RuneScape repeatables (_e.g._ dailies) and farm runs. Displays a window with customizable timers shown with progress bars. Includes ""duration from starting point"" timers and daily/weekly/monthly timers, that reset at UTC 0:00 / RS daily, weekly, and monthly reset times. Timers can be left-clicked to reset their time remaining to the length of the timer (or to the next tick for dailies/weeklies/monthlies).

# Operations
- Left-clicking on a timer's progress bar will reset its progress; do this when you complete the task
- Right-clicking on a timer's progress bar will set its status to complete 
- Shift-left clicking on a timer's progress bar allows you to edit some settings of that timer
- Clicking the + button shows a GUI to a new timer in the current tab
- Shift-clicking the + button shows GUIs to add a new tab
- Clicking the - button (setting it to selected) then clicking a timer's bar will remove that timer
- Shift-clicking the - button will ask if you want to delete the current tab (and its timers)
- Clicking the pin icon will toggle whether the window stays always-on-top
- Adjusting the slider sets the transparency of the window. The minimum is 5%. This is saved when reopening the program

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/bb7d708fac8a4289bd2c1f6add297d6e)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/BuildForSDG/team-011-backend?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=BuildForSDG/team-011-backend&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)![Node.js CI](https://github.com/BuildForSDG/team-011-backend/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

This application is an innovative solution for connecting subsistent farmers to land owners. It offers the farmers the opportunity to rent the lands or lease at affordable prices. We've built a solution that will help Farmers maximize their productivity and output every harvest by providing the most important resource every Farmer needs - Farmland Real Estate. Landowners that own Farmlands that laying unutilized benefits from this solution simply by enrolling on the platform and making their farmlands available in a virtual market. The whole process entails four simple steps

## See Use Case

Below is a use case flow of the application

![FarmLord Use Case](docs/use-case.jpg ""FarmLord Use Case"")

## Why

The solution is necessary because many people who wish to farm do not have information about available lands or the prices. Also, the people who have lands but do not know people who need the lands.

## Usage

The solution consist majorly of four steps

### 1. Farmlands

First, you will need to create an account on Farmlord either as Farmer or Landowner. As a Landowner, you can profile your pieces of farmlands on the platform which automatically becomes available on a virtual market. After registering as a Farmer, you may go on the virtual market and view land that interests you.

### 2. Requests

When you find an interesting Farmland that meets your need on the ""farmland market"", you will simply send a request with just one click! The Landowner will immediately get a ""farmland request"" notification on their dashboard, prompting them of a Farmer's interest on their listed property on the ""farmland market""

### 3. Transact

As soon as a Landowner receives a request to rent or lease their farmland, they will review and accept the request if it meets their preference or decline accordingly. All of these processes should take a few minutes to complete a transaction end to end between a Landowner and the corresponding requesting Farmer.

### 4. Payment

After the Landowner has accepted the land request sent by a Farmer, the Farmer get a notification on their dashboard to make secure payment for a right occupy or lease the farmland as agreed in the terms between Farmer and the Land owner. We've made sure to integrated to a trusted and secure payment service.

## Setup

Install `yarn install`

After clonning the repo `git clone https://github.com/BuildForSDG/team-011-backend.git` , cd team-011-backend to your local machine and moving into the cloned folder, Run `yarn install` to get started by installing dependencies.

`src/server.js` is the entry to the project and source code should go into the `src` folder.

All tests should be written in the `**tests**' folder. There's a sample in there.

This starter uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) as the bundler. It is much simpler that WebPack and the others

### Hints

- Run `yarn install` to get started.
- Install additional dependencies: `yarn add <dependency-name> [-D]`
- Run tests: `yarn test`
- Run tests with test coverage info: `yarn test:cover`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `yarn lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `yarn start`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:1234, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs. Parcel was only added as a sample and for those looking for a simple but effective solution to the hassle of bundlers.

The goal of this mod is to to clean up the store to make it easier to find the right equipment for every task. A secondary goal is to give the store a more uniform look and feel.

**For more details, bug reports and to make suggestions check out the *project page for TidyShop at https://go.xilent.se/fs19_tidyshop*.**

## Category changes:
- New specialized vehicle categories like Hooklift, SwapBody/AR, Fixed-body trucks, Light Commercial Vehicles, Construction, Excavators and more.
- New specialized trailer categories for Light Trailers, Semitrailers, Liquid Transport and UTV/ATV trailers.
- New specialized categories for tools/implements like Hooklift Containers, SwapBody Superstructures, Cranes & Transport, Snow Removal and Hand Tools.
- Additional variants of basegame categeries like Compact Tractors and XL/Tracked Tractors.

## Additional features:
- Unique and descriptive category thumbnails in the same style as basegame categories.
- More descriptive ""subtitle"" in the store with the actual name of the mod (instead of ""Mod"").
- Custom ""query language"" to make it (fairly) simple to add or modify categories if desired.
- Compatible with the CategoryAdder mod, the ""AddStoreCategory"" script and the ""StoreManager"" feature in GlobalCompany

## How it works:
This script generally does two things. Firstly it adds a bunch of new/modified categories and then it moves items (vehicles, implements etc) between these different categories. 

Categories that are too specific/narrow will be merged, categories that are too general/broad will be split up and some items will be moved from Vehicles to Implements (and vice versa). Highly specialized categories such as Animal Transport or Slurry Tanks is left untouched while more generic items such as ""autoloading flatbed semitrailers"" is moved from Baling Technology to a more generic Semitrailers category.

## Final notes:
For a complete list of all new categories, especially if you want to include any of them in your own mod, check out my project page at https://go.xilent.se/fs19_tidyshop. Also, the list of vehicles and implements that this mod covers is by no means complete so I encourage you to post suggetions at the aforementioned project page.

A special thanks goes to ViperGTS96 for creating the great mod 'Category Adder' which pointed me in the right direction to realize this idea!

The Field Automated Routing Module (FARM) allows users to track their location history while moving around a field. This helps to ensure that a field is properly and efficiently covered during fertilization, planting, etc.

<img src=""./images/logo.png"" width=""176"" height=""176"">

## Current functionality
* Tracks user's path as they move. Path is plotted as a semi-transparent rectangluar polygon with a right/left offset as defined by the user. (An offset allows for the user to account for scenarios where the phone/tablet is not placed in the center of the tractor, but on the left or right side of the tractor). Location tracking can be paused and restarted.
* User can define the width of the rectangle in feet so that the width of the sprayer, planter, implement, etc. is represented by the plotted path.
* User can define the boundaries of their field by tapping locations along the perimeter of their field on the map (optional). This area is then highlighted on the main map.
* Location method can be chosen as:
    * GPS (uses only GPS satellite signals)
    * Fused Location (uses a combination of GPS, cell tower, and Wi-Fi signals)
* Location refresh rate can be chosen.

# To Our Dear DFOhub Community

By now, you are no doubt aware of the issue arising from Uniswap’s frontend routing. 

<a href=""https://medium.com/dfohub/a-black-hole-in-uniswap-v2s-front-end-router-is-draining-the-value-of-tokens-26f5a459b5d7"">A Black Hole in Uniswap V2’s Front-End Router Is Draining the Value of Tokens</a> 

We are now ready to take action and leave it behind us once and for all. 

<b>You are going to have the chance to vote on our path forward. But first...</b>

## Thank You For Your Ongoing Support

Throughout this difficult and stressful period, you have demonstrated patience and understanding, and we are grateful. A special thanks to CD, King Shroom, J_Der, Isolating, Suslik, Khonsu, Bbella, JoeGrech and others for helping us explain the problem to Uniswap’s team and bring it to the attention of the wider public.

We want to clarify that this is not a technical problem with smart contracts or anything of that nature. Rather, it is an adverse effect of Uniswap’s centralized design. 

They could resolve it by altering their custom routing system and asking the chain to swap via all possible pairs, instead of only via pairs tied to the six tokens they have arbitrarily chosen. This would not only put an end to vampire bot arbitrage, it would also democratize liquidity pools and thus provider fees; if swaps were not forced to route through a small sample of pairs, there would be no incentive to provide liquidity to those pools over others.

Unfortunately, Uniswap did not by and large even attempt to understand the problem affecting their protocol, let alone collaborate with us to improve it. 

So, for now, we are left to our own devices. And we have come up with our own solution.


# Our Plan

Since we published our article, the bots have multiplied and become more sophisticated.  Fortunately, we have figured out a strategy to escape. 

<b>We need to remove as much liquidity as possible from pairs untied to ETH, and migrate that liquidity to the UniFi-ETH, BUIDL-ETH and ARTE-ETH pairs.</b>

When we developed the $BUIDL, $UniFi and $ARTE smart contracts, we included an emergency function in line with our Responsible approach to DeFi. This function is a Call called “Flash to Wallet” that is perfect for emergency situations like this.

By calling this functionality, we can migrate the funds from current staking contracts—both the rewards and the locked tokens—and send them to others, where stakers can redeem them based on a snapshot that will be taken if the strategy is implemented, following a vote.

And we can do all of this without relying on any centralized third party. 


## What Does This Mean?

By allowing users to unstake their positions from Uniswap’s liquidity pools, we can drain all liquidity from the pairs the bots are using to exploit Uniswap’s routing.

Immediately after a YES vote, the liquidity will be removed, executing all of the actions necessary to implement our strategy. Stakers will be able to redeem their positions + redeemable rewards (accrued up until the emergency action execution block) + bonus reward (see below) all in a single transaction, via the UI at <a href=""https://unimergency.dfohub.com"">https://unimergency.dfohub.com</a>.

The faster we work to do this as a community, the better. To accelerate the transition, we are going to reward each staker who claims their current position within 48 hours with a bonus 50 BUIDL + 0.4 ETH (per each wallet with a contract), taken from the DFOhub wallet.


You can find the code here: https://github.com/b-u-i-d-l/unimergency

## And Then What?

To best elude the bots, all newly available staking positions will be tied to ETH pairs, like in the good old days of Uniswap V1. But we have also coded these new Liquidity Mining Contracts (v1.5) with cool new features:


### Multi-Reward
	
With the current contracts, DFOs could only reward staking with their own voting tokens. But with the v1.5 contracts, they can reward with any token they hold in their wallet! Don’t worry—if they don’t hold the amount of tokens required to pay out rewards, staking to earn them will not be allowed. Rewards will need to be locked in external contracts, so no one, even by voting, can touch them for the wrong reason.

#### Example
The DFOhub DFO (governed by BUIDL) will be able to reward UniFi-ETH stakers with BUIDL, or BUIDL-ETH stakers with UniFi.

### Unlock Function

With v1.5 contracts, positions can be unlocked and withdrawn by stakers anytime, as long as they pay back any claimed rewards, all of which will be forfeit in this scenario.

#### Example
Say you stake BUIDL in a three month position, and the total reward is 150 BUIDL. You can withdraw your position whenever you like before the three months is over, but if you’ve already claimed 50 in rewards, you’ll have to pay that back first to do so, and will not be able to earn the rest of the future rewards you otherwise would have.

### Liquidity Mining Block End

DFOs will be able to set a cutoff in blocks for new positions, so that new ones cannot be opened. Open positions will not be affected.

### Staker Flash-to-Wallet

This is basically the same as the emergency function we are using to unlock and migrate the liquidity, but it will be available to every single staker. By calling Flash to Wallet, stakers will be able to withdraw their earned rewards to their own personal wallet, but send the LP tokens and future rewards to the DFO wallet for emergency purposes. This way, the DFO can’t force the Flash to Wallet via voting (which could be abused by big holders), and every staker can make the choice for themselves.


Current stakers will be able to redeem the rewards their position has earned (along with their position and extra bonus reward) up to the block when the emergency move was executed (not the total reward they would have accrued by the original end of the staking period). 

This removes any incentive for stakers to maintain their current positions. If they want to continue earning rewards, they can open positions in the new staking contracts.


## New Liquidity Mining Rewards

The new BUIDL, UniFi and ARTE positions will only be for pairs tied with ETH. This is to incentivize liquidity and help ensure we won’t continue to be drained by vampire bots. By disallowing positions tied to pairs that are excluded by Uniswap’s routes, stakers will no longer be deprived of the trading fees they signed up for and which they deserve.

Due to the upcoming DFOhub v0.5 release, and the possible switch from the current voting tokens to new ones of the EthItem standard, these new liquidity mining tiers will all only be three months long. To increase the incentives to stake, they will also give more rewards relative to the old positions (and the new ones that will come after DFOhub v0.5).

> spoiler start

We will share the DFOhub v0.5 release plan sometime over the next few weeks. With v0.5, DFOs will be rebranded as EPOs (ETH Programmable Organizations)

v.05 will also come with Liquidity Mining 2.0, which will also be known as Programmable Liquidity Mining and include even more fancy new features.

These changes will reflect new and improved technology.

> spoiler end

Due to the fixed inflation swaps with UniFi and ARTE, BUIDL’s circ supply is currently 88,306 less than planned by the fair inflation strategy paper. Of that, 4,450 BUIDL will be sent to the contract that will reward current stakers, and 83,856 will be sent to the DFOhub wallet to increase the available rewards for staking buidl in the new staking contracts.

<b>NOTE: New ARTE staking positions will not be available until the release of EthItem, which due to the delay caused by this issue is now expected mid-October.</b>


## The New Liquidity Mining Contracts

All new contracts are for a three month period, and new positions can be opened for up to thirty days after they first become available.


### BUIDL-ETH Tier

##### If reward is chosen in BUIDL

-30% reward

-36,000 BUIDL total reward

-120,000 BUIDL max staked simultaneously

##### If reward is chosen in UniFi

-50% reward

-50,000 UniFi total reward

-100,000 BUIDL max staked simultaneously

### UniFi-ETH Tier

##### If reward is chosen in UniFi

-50% reward

-50,000 UniFi total reward

-100,000 UniFi max staked simultaneously

##### If reward is chosen in BUIDL

-30% reward

-30,000 BUIDL total reward

-100,000 UniFi max staked simultaneously

### uSD-USDC / uSD-DAI Tiers

##### If reward is chosen in BUIDL

-15% reward

-15,000 BUIDL total reward

-100,000 uSD max staked simultaneously

##### If reward is chosen in UniFi

-25% reward

-37,500 UniFi total reward

-150,000 uSD max staked simultaneously


Like the v1 mining contracts, all v1.5 contracts are redeemable on a weekly basis.

After the special three month reward period, rewards will be reduced to v1 levels.

We’ll also upgrade the DFOhub frontend with a new Farming section so that you can see every liquidity mining position available among all DFOs. 

We’ve also turned a joke of Ale’s (see the link below) into a real fork of Uniswap’s frontend. It will track DFO token trades more efficiently, and will also be available on the DFOhub GUI.

https://discordapp.com/channels/652132797032562689/701678117886099466/762690195753533500


## About The Proposal Vote

You can vote to agree or disagree with it by staking your BUIDL, UniFi and ARTE up until the end block (https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/11016666). If you have any questions, you can ask them here (https://discord.gg/FPcZpxB) and we will answer them ASAP.

Each token = one vote (1 BUIDL = 1 vote; 1 ARTE = 1 vote; 1 UniFi = 1 vote). When the end block ends, if the majority of staked tokens vote YES, the DFOhub team will immediately begin implementing the strategy to free us from Uniswap’s black hole once and for all.


## An Important Message From Ale

If you aren’t happy with this outcome, please remember it is not DFOhub’s fault (although it is only thanks to the quality of our smart contracts that we can do something about it).

The problem is with Uniswap's protocol. As soon as we understood this, we approached them, hoping they might work with us to find a solution. Instead, we were rudely dismissed. They would not even entertain the prospect that their protocol is flawed (even though it is, thanks to some centralized decisions viewable on their github repo), let alone try to help.

But using DFOhub's own funds, we have figured out our own solution and can resolve the problem (and reward stakers in the process) without relying on a third party, and without needing to compromise our long term strategy or the fair inflation of BUIDL, ARTE and UniFi. 

We delayed important projects like EthItem to deal with this, and are as annoyed as you are.

But we have worked very hard, and have found a way.

Script I just made in node.js to launch all games and apps in steam library, results farming Activity Hours on Steam profile (1000+ Hours in a 3 days)

Make sure you installed steam-user from npm.

Start with command ""node ."" or ""node activity.js""

<p>You can check this guide on <a href=""https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2719939448"">Steam</a>.</p>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>Bot takes the following steps</p>
<ol>
  <li>Checks cost and <i>production growth</i> of all the possible upgrades</li>
  <li>Calculates <i>profitable ratio</i> of each upgrade</li>
  <li>Sorts elements by ratio descending</li>
  <li>Chooses the first element</li>
  <li>Checks if you can purchase upgrade now, if not, it waits to collect money</li>
  <li>Checks if you can buy new node in less than 30 seconds (you can customize this time), if so, it buys it</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Profitable ratio</i> = Production growth / upgrade cost</p>
<p><i>Production growth</i> = Production after upgrade - current production</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>Take the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run the terminal</li>
  <li>Type <code>nano hacknet-bot.js</code></li>
  <li>Copy the code from main.js file and paste into file you just created</li>
  <li>Save the file</li>
  <li>Back to the terminal</li>
  <li>Type <code>run hacknet-bot.js</code></li>
</ol>

<p>You can customize the time of waiting for purchase node (by default 30s) by passing an additional script argument</p>

## wut
A turn-based farming RPG.
## disclaimer
There is some strong language in the game's text, as well as in some of the source code because I am 12 years old and think seeing a rabbit say bad words is funny.

## why
Sometimes I make choices. They aren't always good ones.
## building
Running a `npm install` should get you pretty much everything you need to build this. It's all node based. You'll need [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for one of the (optional) build steps, though. All build scripts are in the **tools** directory.

### Build Scripts

#### BuldCollisions.js
Builds collision data based off the files in **tools/collisionimg**, which are in turn generated from **BuildImages.js**. **tools/cave.png** is also converted into collision data.

Collision datas are arrays of bools, where `true` means a tile is solid and cannot be walked through. In the image files, a tile will be read as `true` if the corresponding pixel is `#FF0000` and `false` otherwise.

Cave Collision is more complicated and the structure is described in the comments of the `BuildCaveCollisions` function.

#### BuildEnemyAttacks.js
Builds enemy attack flows based off the files in **tools/enemyjson**, which are in turn generated with [kelly](https://github.com/HauntedBees/kelly).

#### BuildImages.js
Generate PNGs from the contents of the **tools/ora** folder. With no parameters passed it should generate every image needed for the game.

The following arguments can be supplied (all `.ora` files referenced are in `tools/ora`):

 - `bg`: Copies all layers from `combatbg.ora` into separate PNGs in `img/bgs`.
 - `profile`: Copies all layers from `portraits.ora` (except ones with names starting with ""_"") into separate PNGs in `img/profiles`.
 - `maps`: Goes through all files in `tools/ora/maps` and populates `img/maps`, `img/fg`, and `tools/collisionimg` based on their layers. Maps are generated from all layers not prefixed with `_` except `Foreground` and `Collision`. Foregrounds are generated from the `Foreground` layer, and collision images are generated from the `Collision` layer. If a map has cover layers, they should be named with the `_Cover:xxx` convention and specified in the `covers` variable in the `RipMaps` function in the format of `""mapName"": [""xxx""]`. A few custom rules exist for handling the `northcity` and `hq_IB` maps.
 - `cavecollisions`: Builds `tools/cave.png` used for `BuildCollisions.js`.
 - `basics`: Equivalent to passing all of the `tools/ora` filenames at once (see next item).
 - Pretty much any of the files in `tools/ora` without their file extensions: Copies the `Content` layer of each file (ex. `sheet` maps to `sheet.ora`) into `img/`.

**TODO: *shop_XXX.ora*, *logo.ora*, *colorPreview.ora*, and *endcredits.ora* files still require manual export.**

#### BuildMonochrome.js
Copies all images from **img** into **imggb** after converting them to a 4-color monochrome color scheme.

**TODO: Sprites *FarmInfo%*, *MetalInfo%*, *BtlSel%*, *CornerBtn%*, and *%Sel%* must be manually set to the maximum brightness.**
**TODO: Sprites *%cursor%.%* and *optTile* must be manually corrected.**

#### BuildSpreadsheets.js
Generates game data from the spreadsheets in the **tools/ods** folder. With no parameters passed it should generate all data needed for the game.

The following arguments can be supplied (all `.ods` files referenced are in `tools/ods`, all `.js` files referenced are in `js/gamedata` unless otherwise specified):
 - `T`: Convert rows from `Details_Text.ods` into the `fulltext` map in `text.js`. Spreadsheet is one header row and then several rows with the following columns:
	- `Key`: The reference key for the line of text.
	- `noTrim`: If not set, the end of the line of text will be trimmed off.
	- `profile`: The name of the profile image to show if this text is displayed in world map dialogue.
	- `type`: How the text is used in game. For reference; not used in-game.
	- `en-us`: The English translation of the text.
	- `en-us-sfw`: The profanity-free English translation.
	- `any other language`: Other languages can be defined after `en-us` and `en-us-sfw`, one per column. If a value does not exist in this language, the game will default to the `en-us` translation. **Note:** there is no way to change languages in-game at this time.
 - `S`: Converts rows from `Details_Cutscenes.ods` into the `scripts` map in `cutscenes.js`. Spreadsheet is one header row and rows with `Key` and `Action` columns. `Key` is the in-game reference key, and `Action` is a `&`-separated list of commands that are parsed in `js/worldmap/cutsceneParser.js`.
 - `C`, `Q`, `F`, `E`: Rips crops, equipment, fixtures, and enemies into their respective files in `js/gamedata`.
 - `P`: Converts cells from `Details_BigSprites.ods` and `Details_SmallSprites.ods` into the `sprites` map in `spritedata.js`. For each cell with coordinates `(x, y)` and a value `v`, they will be converted to the a key-value pair of the format `""v"": [x, y]`, or `""v"": [x, y, true]` for cells ripped from `Details_BigSprites.ods`. 

#### Cordova.js
Run with `node tools/Cordova.js ARG` where `ARG` can be:
 - `copy`: Copies all production files to the **cordova/www** folder for building with Cordova.
 - `build`: Build, sign, and zipalign the APK.
 - `all`: Copy and build.

For the `build` step, you will need to create a `tools/creds.js` file that looks like this to package your Cordova app:
```js
module.exports = {
    store: ""full path to your .keystore file"",
    name: ""your key name"",
    pass: ""your store password"",
    jarsigner: ""full path to your jarsigner executable, or just 'jarsigner' if it's in your PATH"",
    zipalign: ""full path to your zipalign executable, or just 'zipalign' if it's in your PATH"",
};
``` 

#### FormatImages.js
Generates upscaled spritesheets for optional in-game graphical filters. Requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for `hq4x` and [scale2x](https://www.scale2x.it/) for `s4xe`. You may need to update the `s2xpath` variable for `s4xe`.

#### Package.js
Concatenates all source files into one **out.js** file. Calling it with the `min` argument will also minify it.

#### gulpfile.js
Calling `gulp watch` will ensure `Package.js` is executed every time a source file is updated.

#### manual/BuildManualParts.js and manual/BuildManual.js
These will create the instruction manual/strategy guide, with most data pulled straight from the game's code. Run `BuildManualParts.js` to populate the `manual/parts` folder with relevant metadata needed to generate the guide, and run `BuildManual.js` to populate the `manual/out` folder with the `manual.html` file and relevant images in the `manual/out/assets` folder.

All enemies, crops, fixtures and equipment are pulled from the game code. The instruction manual is hard-coded in `manual/parts/template.html`. Much of Calsotte's buffs and the Locations are hard-coded in the `BuildManual.js` file, as are the names of specific achievements and enemies for the purposes of skipping some and marking them as spoilers. Pretty much all map/level data is hard-coded.

Running `node BuildManual.js maps` will create the map images used in the guide - this should be done the first time you run this, but won't be needed afterwards unless you change how the maps look.

### Standard Build
Run `node tools/Package.js` to build everything. All standard spritesheets and game datas are pre-built in the the git repository, but if you have made changes, you will need to run the appropriate script described above. Likewise, if you wish to include the filtered sprites, you will need to run `node tools/FormatImages.js`. After building, run `index.html` in your browser to play.

### Android Build
Run `node tools/Cordova.js all` or if you want to do the building manually:

```
node tools/Cordova.js copy
cd cordova
cordova build android --release
cd platforms/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore [yourKeyStore] app-release-unsigned.apk [yourKey]
zipalign -v 4 app-release-unsigned.apk Uprooted.apk
```

If you want to make a version for other Cordova platforms like iOS or something, check out Cordova's documentation for how to add new platforms to a project. There is little custom Cordova code, so it is unlikely that anything in the existing codebase is Android specific.

### Electron Build
Complete all the Standard Build steps above.
**Dev Build:** `npm start`
**Package Only:** `npm pack`
**Package for Distribution:** `npm run dist`

## About the Project

The Code is written in [P5JS](https://p5js.org/). I also coded a [Squirrel 🐿️ that lives in the Forest](https://github.com/johnnyawesome/Squirrel) and searches for Acorns, using the [P5.Play-Library](https://p5play.org/) which in turn uses the [Planck Physics Engine](https://piqnt.com/planck.js/).

## Initialization

- Generate a Background out of Grass-Tiles
- Generate a number of Chickens (You can change ""numberOfChickens"" to get more / less Chickens)
- Generate a number of Bees (You can change ""numberOfBees"" to get more / less Bees)
- Generate a random Pattern of Plants / Flowers
- Generate Food-Piles at random Places
- Draws the Fence

## 🐔The Chickens🐔

- The Chickens will search for Food
- When they find Food, they'll eat it
- When the current Food is gone, the Chicken will search for more Food
- Sometimes a Chicken will take a short break, standing still, to be more natural-looking

## 🐝The Bees🐝
- The Bees fly all over the screen, from right to left 🐝
- Bees fly at random Speeds on their X-Axis. Some are slower, some are faster
- To look more natural, the Bees oscillate on their Y-Axis
- When a bee hits the left edge of the Screen, it dies
- A new Bee is generated in it's place

## 🌾The Food🌾

- Food will spawn in random Locations
- When a Food-Pile is eaten, a new Food-Pile will spawn at a new random Location

| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |


## Embedded Volumetric Optionality Protocol

### Abstract

EVO Protocol is a dynamically adjusting ERC-compatible protocol that adjusts based on _volume_
<br>

EVO tokens are minted and burned on-demand by deposit and withdraw operations directly via the contract.

> Initiated Protocol Operations

-   Deposit <br>
-   Withdraw <br>
-   Transfer <br>

These operations contribute to `transfer rates`.
`Transfer rates` are tracked both in `aggregate` and `individually` (i.e. per address).
The `period of time` for tracking is the last `25 days`.

### Time and Period

> [V2 Upgrade will include upgrading the time and date to a new libray](https://github.com/bokkypoobah/BokkyPooBahsDateTimeLibrary)

Time and Period should be defined on a `per market` basis. Meaning you should choose what is computed to be the _optimal_ time period based on historical analysis.

Multiples of 4,6, etc are suggested

-   For Example
    `25` days has`36000 minutes`, which divided by `block_time=4` gives `9000`

GasEVO is determined both in `aggregate` (dynamically) and `individually` for each address based on transactional (i.e. volumetric transactional information) stored and updated through the smart contract during the previous transactions.
<br>

All three operations such as `deposit`, `withdraw` and `transfer` can equally contribute to the `transfer` rates that are tracked totally and individually(as per holder) by the smart contract for the period of the last `25 days`. <br>
The token price is determined dynamically(and individually for each holder) based on the information stored or updated in the smart contract during previous transactions:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/sambacha/2cd97b61b0a29dd18f0d12fb0029ee73/raw/67c4785230a544558263beb4ede534ad2b3a0bc4/equation.svg)

## Utility

<!-- EN: specifcaiton -->
<!-- DE: spezifikation -->

> Note: This is specific to the implementation based on the reference specification , as described in the whitepaper (./latex/\*_/_.tex)

Given enough liquidity, `GasEVO` has a way to compute the `exchange rate` towards the base instrument (ETH). <br>

Like this, movements of the bigger or significant volumes can be interpreted as market trends (i.e. `gwei` pricing.) <br>

By utilizing small volume movements and disincentivizing the larger ones without compensation to holders every exceeding `bulge bracket` trade of the token is tracked by the smart contract and higher ""transactional"" fees are applied (re: withdraw, or 'consumption').

> Note: We describe `transactional` fees sometimes as an `interest` fee. This language is marked as _depreciated_ as this confers and/or implies a rate of return that is somewhat deterministic, this however is not the case per se as it is entirely possible that all trades could be below the `transfer rate` during a period/epoch.

Transference of funds _below_ daily volume threshold does not impose any interest fee. <br>

When the threshold has been exceeded some percentage of tokens gets burned, for the transfer, for `deposit` or for `withdraw` of the base instrument (ETH). <br>

Thresholds are tracked individually per address as the average rate and have a function by which they operate on. <br>

EVO Protocol Reference Implementation Overview

## Table of Contents

[TOC]


### Protocol Overview

EVO tokens are minted and burned **on-demand** by deposit and withdraw operations directly via the contract.

#### Initiated Protocol Operations

* Deposit
* Withdraw
* Transfer

These **operations** contribute to the *transfer rates*. Transfer rates are tracked both **in aggregate** and **individually** (i.e. *per address*). The *period* of time for tracking is the last `25 days`

> 25 days has `36000 minutes`, which *divided by* `block_time=4` gives `9000`

**GasEVO** is determined both in aggregate (dynamically) and individually for each address based on transactional (i.e. volumetric transactional information) stored and updated through the smart contract during the previous transactions. 


All three operations such as deposit, withdraw and transfer can equally contribute to the transfer rates that are tracked totally and individually(as per holder) by the smart contract for the period of the last 25 days.The token price is determined dynamically(and individually for each holder) based on the information stored or updated in the smart contract during previous transactions:


{equation.gasevo}

$$
P_{t+1}(h, a):=\sqrt{\frac{D_{t}}{S_{t}}}+I_{t+1}^{\prime}(h, a)
$$



The above equation will compute the price for a holder $$h$$ to purchase a certain amount of `EVO` tokens in exchange for a base deposit in `ETH/WETH` at the given discrete time - $$t +1$$ , where $$Dt$$ stands for the deposit of `ETH` in the smart contract at previous time - point and $$St$$ stands for the total supply of `EVO` tokens so far.

The first component with the token - base ratio $$Dt/St$$ under the square root is the *indicative price* and **does not depend on the purchase/transferred** amount, ``$a$.``

Ergo, the component $$I_{t+1}^{\prime}(h, a)$$ is called the *discounted interest rate* and it can grow *proportionally* to a within a range of $$[0, 0.24]$$ of ``$$a$$.``

Higher interest payouts can slow down, **deaccelerate**, the price movement. Interest rate determines how fast, or **accleration**, such price can change depending on the market demand & supply pressure for EVO-based tokens. Interest[#] is computed individually for each EVO holder. 

*Note* that all interest payments are contributed to the same common deposit `Dt` on the smart contract, which is supporting the indicative price. This means that interest is shared by all holders that *choose not to trade their tokens* at the moment.

An ERC20 smart contract will contain the information about the balance of every address,

##### Address Information (i.e. wallets)

$$B(h) s.t. Bt + 1(h, a): = Bt(h) + a$$.

In addition to the individual balances, GasEVO contract keeps track about how much each holder has transferred in the last epoch (i.e. 25days)

##### Total average transfer rate for an address

$$avg(Rt + 1(h, a)): = avg(Rt(h)) + a$$

##### Total average daily transfer rate for all holders 
$$avg(R¯ t + 1(h, a)): = avg(R¯t(h)) + a$$.


### Calculations
More formally calculation of the individual interest rate as well as the applied ownership discount can be described in following steps:

For: $$l := 4 , m := 26$$ are the *low* and *high* *transfer rate constants* and 

$$\beta=\frac{\operatorname{avg}\left(B_{t+1}(h, a)\right)}{S_{t+1}}$$, the *future balance ratio*, we resolve $$\tau=\frac{\operatorname{avg}\left(R_{t+1}(h, a)\right)}{\operatorname{avg}\left(\bar{R}_{t+1}(h, a)\right)}$$ is the *future transfer ratio* and $$\theta=\frac{B_{t}(h)}{S_{t}}$$ is the ownership ratio at a *discrete point in `block time`* then we resolve the **interest rate**;

$$
P_{t+1}(h, a):=\sqrt{\frac{D_{t}}{S_{t}}}+I_{t+1}^{\prime}(h, a)
$$

thereby applying the ownership ratio for discount 

$$l_{t+1}^{\prime}(h, a):=\frac{a \times \sqrt{l * \max \left(\min \left(\theta, l^{2}\right), 1\right)}}{100}$$

whereas %$$I$$ is the *discount**, thereby computing the *discounted interest* as,

$$I_{t+1}^{\prime}(h, a):=\max \left(I_{t+1}(h, a), l_{t+1}^{\prime}(h, a)\right)-l_{t+1}^{\prime}(h, a)$$

Price dynamics of equation (1) depends on the transactions volume conducted by all of the involved market participants and bounded by $$O(sqrt(n))$$.

Therefore it can be expected that the demand for EVO Protocol based tokens like GasEVO will be able to represent the *demand* for the value storage, whereas GasEVO represents the value of storage as a derivative function of the underlying asset, Ethereum (i.e. gwei, or as a fixed unit of account for contracting)

This is an Ardunio project that measures soil moisture to determine if the plant needs to be watered. It's designed to be a data-driven support system for the various plants I'd like to care for. By being able to consistently deliver desired moisture conditions into soil, I hope to keep plants growing on auto-pilot with various tweaks to threshholds.

Universal remote climate monitoring and management system for greenhouses and indoor grow operations.

Live demo at http://panhandleponics.ddns.net:1966/climateczar/

See also https://3dgtower.com

Climate Czar is a Linux and Wordpress based system that gathers readings from any type of sensor or switch that can be read from the command line, whether it is a local device connected to a GPIO bus or a network device. By the same token, the system will control output switches that can also be toggled from the command line. There are no brand/model hardware dependencies, you can even use it with your own custom IoT devices.

Most smart home devices are controllable from the command line of your computer over your network. For example, you can download a utility for TP-Link/Kasa devices from https://github.com/python-kasa/python-kasa for this or you can write scripts for this that use standard command line tools in Linux and MacOS. There are many other brands with this capability as well.

Virtual input sensors/switches can be created that return the average of multiple variable value sensors (temperature, humidity, etc) as well as AND/OR/NOT logic gates based on multiple binary switch type input sensors.

Enabling of output switches may be over-ridden by the status of another output switch. For example, an output switch that controls exhaust fans can be disabled if another switch running a heater is turned on.

Output switches really don't even have to physically exist. Since their operation is controlled with on/off bash scripts, these scripts can also be used to send email/SMS notifications or even make a curl URL call. Input sensors/switches can be assigned to multiple output switches, so you can easily receive a notification at the same time that a physical output switch is toggled on or off.

The Climate Czar Wordpress plugin is only necessary for adding, configuring, and deleting input sensors and output switches. The undercarriage will continue to run in the background even without the web server running. The Wordpress plugin also provides dashboards and histograms to give you a visual representation of all devices and charts that you can use to fine tune your settings.

All connected devices can be assigned to separate groups which allows you to have separate dashboards for multiple greenhouses or grow operations. There's no limit to the number of attached devices and groups. This system running on a small i5 based server with 8GB of RAM was tested with 500 virtual devices and still completed all read and write operations within the every-15-seconds processing loop.

This system will run effectively on a Raspberry PI with a LAMP stack, or any web server that supports PHP, MySQL, and bash scripts. The Climate Czar server itself could actually monitor and control multiple greenhouses and grow operations in different locations if network enabled sensors and switches are utilized throughout (you'd be surprised by what you can accomplish with a public facing Nginx server running as a reverse web proxy).

### Input Device Types
1.	Variable Value Sensor (Temperature, Humidity, pH, EC, AD Convertor, Etc)
2.	Average From a Group of Variable Value Sensors
3.	Remote Switch (Float Switch, Door/Window Switch, Photocell Switch, Etc)
4.	AND Gate of a Group of Remote Switches
5.	OR Gate of a Group of Remote Switches
6.	NOT Gate of a Group of Remote Switches
7.	Scheduler (unlimited on/off schedules per day)
8.	Web Console Switch (Only Controllable Via Web UI)
9.	Raw Text Output Device (only for displaying text, cannot be used as a controller)

The virtual input devices are where the Climate Czar really shines because they allow you to consider multiple sample points before taking action. For example, having temperature sensors on the east and west ends of a greenhouse. Each one of those could be reporting significantly different temperatures at the same time. It makes more sense to turn on heating or cooling based on the average temperature.

Climate Czar is not region specific. If you have temperature sensors that only return values in Celsius and you want to work in Fahrenheit, you just convert the return value in your read script (command line utilities like bc allow you to do floating point math in bash). Climate Czar merely looks at numbers and performs actions based on math, no matter what unit of measurement is used.

WiFi controlled AC outlets such as TpLink/Kasa devices have a manual on/off button on them that could allow a person to turn them on when Climate Czar says they should be off. Output switches have a One Shot option that tells the system whether to only execute the on/off script one time, or to execute the script once every minute in order to maintain the intended on/off state.

With the user interface being based on Wordpress, creating custom dashboards is as simple as creating your own pages or posts and inserting shortcodes with ID number of the input sensor or output switch passed to it. You can even similarly embed these live device views in an external website if you wish by making calls to specific PHP files in the plugin folder the same way.

Anybody who has Wordpress experience can 100% customize the look and feel of your system in order to tailor it to your operation. Everything is built on a Bootstrap based Wordpress theme, so it's real easy to over-ride colors and styles. The pages of the default system are built and rendered using the WP Bakery Page Builder plugin, but you could easily replace that with your own favorite editor instead.

Even though bash scripts are the most common in Linux, any other kind of script or even a compiled binary may be used. All that matters is that the proper command shell or interpreter is installed on the system and the script is owned by the user that the web server runs as and has the executable bit set. Device read scripts simply need to output a single integer or floating point numeric value to stdout.

While this system was designed and tested in a 51x18 foot greenhouse, there are probably many other uses for it besides greenhouses and indoor grow operations. If you need to read numeric values from sensors or switches and turn other devices on and off based on those values, then it's likely that this system will work for what you're needing to do. It was intentionally left completely open ended for this very reason.

</p>

A Minecraft Forge Mod that takes out the simple out of Crop Farming.<br>
Currently focuses on soil management, and plant growth restrictions.

This mod modifies the growth **requirements**, growth **chance** and **yield** of all compatible Crops.

This mod will not add new crops. Use supported mods like Simple Farming.

## Mod Support
### Supported Crops
- Minecraft (exceptions: coca beans, saplings, sweet berry bush, mushroom)
- Simple Farming (exceptions: saplings/trees & bushes & grapes)
- XL Food Mod (exceptions: vanilla spice plant)

### Partial Support
- HarvestCraft Crops (only the crops overlapping with SimpleFarming, the remainder falls back to generic crop stats)

**Note:** HarvestCraft Crops contains over 70 crops and requires time to research/guesstimate the crop characteristics.
If you want full support consider helping out. 

### Compatible Crops
**Note:** not supported crops will fallback to generic behavior
- blocks extending CropsBlock
- blocks implementing IGrowable
    - should contain a Block Property for age (IntegerProperty with the identifier ""age"") if not crop yield will not be properly modified

### Farming For Blockheads
**Note:** you will not be able to create their fertilized farmland variants because vanilla farmland is no longer attainable in survival.
- made Red Fertilizer a `Nitrogen Fertilizer`
- made Green Fertilizer a `Phosphorus & Potassium Fertilizer`
- added `Soil Amendments` to the market
- added `Measuring Devices` to the market

### Growth Speed
Although Crop growth can be accelerated by other mods, the growth requirements still need to be fulfilled in most cases.
(Mods that use the IGrowable interface to grow a crop circumvent the growth restrictions since the CropGrowthEvent is not fired).

### Serene Seasons
Theoretically compatible, but not tested.


# Wiki
## Crop Growth & Yield
- growth requirements
    - soil moisture
    - soil macronutrients: `Nitrogen (N)`, `Phosphorus (P)`, `Potassium (K)`
    - soil pH inside tolerance
    - temperature inside tolerance
- growth chance
    - based on nutrient availability in soil which depends on soil pH
- crop yield
    - based on nutrient concentration in soil throughout its growth stages

Note:
- Unsatisfied plants will eventually starve
- Crops can be burned by over-fertilization


## Soils (Farmland)
```diff
! The Mod removes the ability to create vanilla farmland from vanilla dirt with the hoe
```
You can craft the different ""non tilled"" soil variants with dirt, sand and clay. Place them in the world and use your hoe on it.
You can use a shovel to convert tilled soil back to their respective dirt variant.

![Soil Variants](screenshots/soil_variants.png)
_From left to right: Vanilla Dirt, Sandy Soil, Loamy Soil, Silty Soil and Clayey Soil_

### Soil Properties
- Soil Texture
- Moisture
- pH
- Nutrients:
`Nitrogen (N)`,
`Phosphorus (P)`,
`Potassium (K)`
- Organic Matter Content
    - increases moisture capacity/retention of soil
    - increases nutrient retention of soil

#### Soil Moisture Level
Instead of vanilla crops requiring only moist farmland to grow well, 
each crop requires now the moisture level to be within a specific range to be able to grow.<br>
There are 10 soil moisture levels, ranging from 0 to 10:<br>
SEVERELY_DRY -> EXCESSIVELY_DRY -> ABNORMALLY_DRY -> DRY -> AVERAGE_0 -> AVERAGE_1 -> MOIST ->
ABNORMALLY_MOIST -> WET -> EXCESSIVELY_WET -> STANDING_WATER
<br><br>

<br><br>
![Simple Farming Rice Field](screenshots/wet_rice_field.png)
_SimpleFarming Rice growing on a ""flooded"" field (Wet, Excessively Wet, Standing Water)_

### Player Interaction
- Moisture capacity can be modified
  - by placing sand/gravel/clay/stone below soil
  - adding compost to soil which adds organic matter to the soil
- Organic Matter has a chance to decay into nutrients for the soil
- Overall pH doesn't change much by itself, the player is the only big influence through the application of liming or acidifying material
- Basically macronutrients and compost are the least things that should be checked before replanting

### Raised Soil Bed
Crafted by putting soil into a partially filled composter.
- the heat of the decomposing compost raises the soil temperature allowing plants to grow in colder regions
- keep the soil moist and occasionally reapply compost to keep the decomposition process going

### Environmental Influences
- Rain
  - can decrease soil pH
  - can wash away nutrients if the organic matter content of soil is low

## Plant Macronutrients
- Nitrogen (N)
    - high concentration in soil leads to faster crop growth
- Phosphorus (P)
    - high concentration in soil leads to better crop yield
- Potassium (K)
    - high concentration in soil leads to better crop yield

## Soil Amendments
### Compost
Applied to the soil to increase the organic matter content of soil.

### Fertilizer
Fertilizers increase the Nutrients in the soil.<br>
```diff
! The Mod removes the ability to use bone meal on compatible crops
```
**Note:** Apply Fertilizers to the soil instead of the crop.
- `Bone Meal`
- `Industrial Fertilizer`
- `Granite Dust`
- `Feather Meal`
- `Seaweed Meal`
- `Fish Meal`
- `Soybean Meal` `optional (requires simplefarming or harvestcraft)`
### Liming Material
Increases the Soil pH.
- `Lime Dust`
  - uncommon side product from cutting Rocks with the Stonecutter
- `Wood Ash`
  - process charcoal into dust with the mortar and pestle (unrealistic)
 <br>(make wood ash a waste product of burning/smelting wood logs in a furnace?)
### Acidifying Material
Decreases the Soil pH.
- `Blaze Powder`
- `Gunpowder`
- `Sulphur` `from simplysalty mod`

Web app to manage herenboeren farms

# Technology choises
The web app needs to be flexible for new use cases and be able to
run on mobile devices (keeping notes in the field).

## Development tools
For development of the software PyCharm will be used.
For deployment Docker will be used.
For testing we use Jtest (javescript) and nose (python).
For continuous integration testing we use CircleCI
Version control is done on Github.

## Web front end
For the web front end we will use the stencil compiler to make webcomponents.
This also means typescript is used everywhere.

For the interface ionic v4 is used together with capacitor (to access mobile APIs)
to enable a good mobile experience.

For mapping leaflet.js is used, for other visuals D3.js.
Routing is done with stencil router and state mangement with mobx.
For internationalisation we use i18nnext.

## Web server and data crunching
For the backend we use Python 3.6 with the micro webframework
bottle.py and Gevent for efficient multi-threading.
NgInx will be used to serve the static webpages, enable
secure (SHH) reverse proxying to the Python webserver (http and websockets).

## Databases
We need to be able to answer questions like:
 - which plant was planted on which field and when
 - a plant of this family is not allowed on this field anymore for so and so long
 - we need good free text search to search through our notes, plant descriptions etc.
 - we need to store historical weather data and other metrics
 - we need to store geographical (GEOjson) data (field layouts etc.)
 - we need to store documents and images (attached to nodes)
 - we need to be able to easily extend the data model

All these types of data structures have highly specialised database:
- a graph database like Neo4j is very good at relational data
- a search database like ElasticSearch  is good in free text search and suggestions
- a time series database like InfluxDB is good at storing time series and event data
- the file system is best at storing images and files

We are clearly in need of a multi model database, therefore the
best database fit for this project seems to be: MongoDB",0,0,2,0,farming,"[farming, planning]",00000

`config/serial.js`
```
module.exports = {
    retryDelay: 10000,
    port: '/dev/ttyACM0',
    baudRate: 115200,
}
```

change the initial config database files to fit your needs:
copy or rename `config/index_template.js` to `config/index.js`
then have a look at the file and the sub folders to change to your needs.

## Usage
- start server `server/$  yarn start`
- open webbrowser at [`localhost:3030`](http://localhost:3030)
- click on the settings symbol
- click on `import config from files`
- this fills / adds to the database
- happy harvesting ;-)

## Summary

7 Days to Die Modlet: Genetically modify seeds to grow plants with new properties

[Standard Edition Introduction (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/Rlf7xDVKjIE) | [Researcher Edition Differences (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/4QvH_5q_P2g)

## Features

*Have you ever wanted to customize your seeds so they can meet your personal needs?*

### Seed Enhancement

Craft the **Hot Box** (a new workstation) to modify seeds with a variety of special traits!

Trait Name | Description
:---: | ---
Bonus | further doubles crop yield (4x yield over unmodified crops).
Explosive | triggers a concealed explosive [comparable to cooking pot mine] when stepped on, struck with a melee weapon, or hit with an arrow. *Due to the flexible nature of plants, the detonator will not trigger if struck with bullets or other explosives*.
Fast | plant reaches maturity in half the time.
Renewable | clean, fresh water allows this plant to spread out its roots and produce crops endlessly.
Thorny | integrates with sharp, metal thorns. Touching them will cause one to bleed.
Underground | fused with mushroom dna, allowing growth without the need for sunlight.

#### Trait Compatibility Matrix

Traits can also be combined (up to 2), though not all are compatible with one other.

|   | B | E | F | R | T | U |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| B | ✅ | 🚫 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| E | 🚫 | ✅ | ✅ | 🚫 | 🚫 | ✅ |
| F | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| R | ✅ | 🚫 | ✅ | 🚫 | ✅ | ✅ |
| T | ✅ | 🚫 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| U | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚫 |

> *Note that Mushrooms cannot be given the Underground trait because they already have it.*

### Effects of Trait Combination

In situations where two different traits are adopted, the plant will benefit from each trait in equal measure.

But in situations where a trait is doubled, the name of the trait changes in the following ways:

Trait Name | Description
:---: | ---
Bountiful Bonus | further ***quadruples*** crop yield (***8x*** yield over unmodified crops)
Extremely Explosive | triggers a concealed explosive ***with a large payload*** [comparable to hubcap mine] when stepped on, struck with a melee weapon, or hit with an arrow. Due to the flexible nature of plants, the detonator will not trigger if struck with bullets or other explosives
Rapid Growth | reaches maturity in a ***quarter*** of the time
Extra Thorny | integrates with ***many*** sharp, metal thorns. Touching them will cause one to bleed ***profusely***

## 2 Editions to Choose From

This modlet comes with 2 Editions: `Standard` and `Researcher`. The one you choose for your game or community should be carefully considered.

You can download the Edition you prefer from our [Latest Release](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson/gmo-farming/releases/latest) page by expanding the Assets link to see available downloads.

### `Standard` Experience

[Standard Edition Introduction (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/Rlf7xDVKjIE)

This Edition is the most vanilla-friendly experience you can expect from a mod like this.

The primary focus of this Edition is to encourage use and expand the base game's content: just craft the `Hot Box` to get started.

### `Researcher` Experience

[Researcher Edition Differences (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/4QvH_5q_P2g)

This Edition is more focused on player specialization and giving the player a new challenge to overcome.

- instead of having immediate access to the new seed recipes, the player needs to *researching* the recipes by crafting schematics.
- such research is time and resource intensive, requiring intentional effort in working towards the player's desired seeds and traits. Naturally, this will be a challenge and require a significant amount of farming.
- primary focus of this Edition is to provide a difficulty barrier to crafting these new seeds. While the recipes to craft the seeds aren't complicated or challenging, researching them is and this requires players to invest the time if they want the benefit from these enhanced crops. This Edition is an effort to prevent the GMO Farming mod from totally throwing the game out of whack with easy-to-craft super-crops

### `Researcher Loot` Experience

This Edition is the same as Researcher with one major change: players will be able to find schematics in quest loot.

Tier | Enhanced Chance | Single Trait Chance | Double Trait Chance
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
1 | 0% | 0% | 0%
2 | 1% | 0% | 0%
3 | 5% | 1% | 0%
4 | 15% | 5% | 1%
5 | 25% | 15% | 5%

## Compatibility

This modlet is compatible with Servers and Clients in all combinations; examine the chart below for details specific to your situation:

Environment | Compatible? | Details
:---: | :---: | ---
Dedicated Server | Yes | This mod is meant for dedicated servers only

# Nice Musical Chairs model

The NMC model, a sequel of the Musical Chairs model, explores how land use competition could be constrained by cooperation and social institutions.

The NMC model test the effects of social structure and dynamics, according to which individual stakeholders compete and cooperate depending on adscription to social groups. The model also considers two particular modalities of cooperative mechanisms: land use pairing, the awarding, in terms of productivity, of any direct collaboration between farming and herding within a group; and group management, the prerogative of a group leadership to manage individual stakeholders in order to pursue a particular proportion between farming and herding. Lastly, the model allows assessing the effects of these mechanisms under either open or restricted access to pasture regimes.

---
[Corporate Farming](https://corporate-farming.netlify.app/) is a web-based application, created with the objective of opening new markets for farmers. This is the part of our Last Year Project wherein we worked on this farmer-centric application. Farmers can use this application to list their lands on the website, which can be leased by corporates. Alternatively, the farmer can also sell their harvest if they are not willing to lease their land. Both of these things are contract-based. Farmers can also take advantage of different prediction models on the website as well.

**01)	Problem and the Nature of the business:** 

In this project, our client wants a web portal to build an island wide volunteering community for organic farming. This community will be a non-profit organization and the ultimate goal of this community web application is to make a country full of organic farming products. 

**02)	Objectives** 

*	Make awareness about organic farming throughout the country especially among young generation 
*	Provide help for organic farmers to increase their crops. 
*	Make a platform for volunteers to gather and share their helping hands to improve the organic farming in Sri Lanka. 

**03)	Requirements**

_**Functional requirements of the web application**_

This web application will consist of following functionalities. 

*	There should be profiles for the Volunteers, Farmers and the Administrators. Therefore we have to have sign up, login processes and profile creation process for each type of actors. 
*	Administrator, Farmers and Volunteers can post volunteering opportunities/event all around the country from this web application. 
*	Volunteers, Farmers can join those opportunities. (When joining for a volunteering opportunity, volunteers who live nearby to the particular volunteering event will be appointed as leaders and they will facilitate every needs of the volunteers coming from other places). 
*	Leaders/volunteers, farmers can make chat groups for particular event. 
*	And there will be a main forum for ask any question which are related to organic farming and get answers. Here any member can ask questions and answer them also.
*	Administrators can generate reports on the volunteering events. 
*	We will create a blog for our web application. In here any member of the system can add blog posts about new facts on organic farming and organic foods.
*	We will provide all the contact details of the agriculture offices, Govijana sewa offices, Ministry of Agriculture and other agriculture related government bodies.
*	And we will give facility to hold online conferences for interesting parties of organic farming though our web application. Those will organized by the system administrators
*	Farmers can publish details about their farms, crops and prices of their products to the audience of the web application. Other farmers and volunteers can view them also.

_**Non-functional requirements of the web application**_

*Performance* 

*	Time that the system takes to database queries between the backend server and web application should be less than 5 seconds. 
*	Report generation should be done within 5 secs. 

*Security*

This project is the backend of the project GreenPi, it saves the historical and configuration of GreenPi system.

## Table of contents:

- [Requirements](#Requirements)
- [Installation](#Installation)
- [Docker image repositories](#Docker%20image%20repositories)
- [How to use the Docker images](#How%20to%20use%20the%20Docker%20images)
  - Pull simple image
  - Using _docker-compose_
- [License](#License)

## Requirements

You must to set-up some environment variables:

_Mandatory:_

- **DATABASE_URI**: The URI of MongoDb instance
- **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID**: This is used for the Google authentication
- **GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET**: This is used for the Google authentication
- **GOOGLE_REDIR_URL**: This is used for the Google authentication
- **SECURITY_JWT_SECRET**: This is used to encrypt the JWT Token

_Optional:_

- **SECURITY_BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS**: An integer used for encrypt data
- **PORT**: The server port
- **SERVER_NAME**: The server name. By default, the field _name_ from package.json is used
- **DATABASE_URI_TEST**: The URI of MongoDb instance. Used only for unit testing

For the develop environment, you can add a _nodemon.json_ file which is not tracked by GIT. More info [here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md)

Example (_nodemon.json_):

```json nodemon.json
{
  ""env"": {
    ""DATABASE_URI"": ""mongo db url"",
    ""GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"": ""xxx"",
    ""GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET"": ""xxx"",
    ""GOOGLE_REDIR_URL"": ""redir url"",
    ""SECURITY_JWT_SECRET"": ""xxx""
  }
}
```

## Using the Docker image

There are some official [repositories](#Docker%20image%20repositories).

```bash
docker pull gmdcwork/greenpi-backend:[version]
# Please set the correct variable values
docker run --name greenpi-backend-instance \
  -e DATABASE_URI='mongodb://mongo/greenpi-backend' \
  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="""" \
  -e GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="""" \
  -e GOOGLE_REDIR_URL="""" \
  -e SECURITY_JWT_SECRET="""" \
  -d greenpi-backend:[version]
```

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

Start the application in _production_ mode:

```bash
yarn start:prod
```

The command `yarn start` is similar but it does not set the environment variable `NODE_ENV`.

## Admin user

This step is only necessary for the first admin!

In order to create an admin user, you must have to get access to the database and in the collection _User_, modify the field roleName to _Admin_

Now the user has the _Admin_ privileges.

## Build Docker container

You can use an [official docker image](#Docker%20image%20repositories) Docker image repositories:

```bash
yarn build
```

Now you could run the Docker image. [Example explained](#Using%20the%20Docker%20image)

## Docker image repositories

There are two repositories:

- [Git package registry](https://github.com/gabrielmdc/greenpi-backend/packages)
- [DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/gmdcwork/repository/docker/gmdcwork/greenpi-backend)

C.R.O.P.S. : CRoissance Optimale des Plantes en Sol. Gestion des capteurs et stockage dans CouchDB

## C'est Quoi?
Colecte des donnees environementales pour unbe croissance optimale des plantes
et stockage de ces donnees dans une base de donmnee de type couchDB

Le systeme est base sur les capteurs suivants:
 - Le capteur DHT22 permet la mesure de la temperature ambiante
   ainsi que du niveau d'humiditee ambiante
 - Le capteur CSMS V1.2 permet la mesure de la quantitee d'eau dans le sol.
   CSMS: 'Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor'
 - Le captteur BMP085 permet la mesure de la pression et de la temperature
   (de maniere semblet'il plus precise aue le DHT mais je ne l'ai pas encore verifie)
 - Le capteur TSL2561 Permet de mesurer la lumiere recue par les plantes
 
 le tout controle par un microcontroleur de type ESP32 avec wifi integre le ""LoLin d32-Pro"" et utilisant un afichage e-Paper LOLIN_IL3897.
 
 - main.cpp       : Contiens le code a flasher sur l'EPS32 et qui vas collecter les donnees
 - cropsDB.ipyndb : Contiens le notebook Jupyter permetant de visualiser et d'analyser les donnees
 
## Pour quoi ?
Il y as deux idees deriere ce developement:
- Tester differents capteurs pour une agriculture plus digitale et voir ce que l'on peux tirer de l'analyse des donnees mais tout de meme a bas cout et partager avec tous les moyens de le metre en oeuvre (l'ensemble du systeme de captation des donnees coute moins de 50$)
- L'autre question est est'il possible de produire en appartement avec eclairage artificiel tout en emetant autant voire moins de CO2 que des produits issus du suipermarche.

Ce Developement c'est effectue au Fablab Artilect https://artilect.fr/ et as ete presente pour la premiere fois durant le Fablab Festival 2019 https://fablabfestival.artilect.fr/
 
## Coment l'installer?

### Instalation de la partie capture des donnees
pour pouvoir fonctioner il vous faudra soit avoir un acces a CouchDB soit instale sur votre ordinateur soit une en ligne de style CloudAnt dont la version Lite (Gratuite) devrais etre sufisante: https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant) 

le code main.cpp est prevu pour etre utilise avec PlatformIO sur atom
* Il vous faudra installer Atom: https://atom.io/
* Ensuite platformIO: dans Atom aller dans settings > Pakages > et instaler ""platformio-ide""
* Dans platformIO Home, aller dan libraries et instalez les libraries suivantes:
  * Adafruit BMP085 
  * Adafruit GFX
  * Adafruit Unified Sensor
  * Adafruit TSL2561
  * ArduinoJson (Par Benoit Blanchon)
  * DHTesp (Par Bernd Giesecke)
  * NTPClient (Par Fabrice Weinberg)
  * TimeLib (Par Paul Stoffregen)
  * La librarie LOLIN_EPD (Par Wemos) est aussi necessaire mais n'est pas disponible en installation automatique il faudra aller la chercher ici: https://github.com/wemos/LOLIN_EPD_Library et copier le repository dans le repertoire lib de votre projet.
* Modifier le main.cpp afin dy introduire vos parametres WiFi et CouchDB dans les definitions 
 
### Instalation de la partie analyse des donnees

Control and evaluate serial-exposed **Cerea** features comfortably with an Arduino based touchscreen remote control. To see it in action have a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrCHwqn8U7Y) (German)!

**Currently supported features**

- Setting MARC, A, B, right, left, AUTO via touchscreen (command: @CEREA)
- Reading @SDOSE command to control a relay (RELAY_PIN_1/2; default: pins 49/53) depending on first boom box section and GPS speed. Can be enabled/disabled via touchscreen (enabled when ""Aktiv"" and ""Streu"" buttons are active).
- Control relays also manually via touchscreen (""Streu"" button).
- Reading @STATUSAM if available to sync UI
- Showing current boombox states (rectangles at top of display: grey = unused, red = not active, green = active)
- BETA: Control different boomboxes (1-10) via the @BOOMBOX command  (Page 2: 1 - 10; note that page changing could lead to missed status data from Cerea, so the GUI might be not in sync with Cerea for some moments) 
- Vibrate on touch; output on adjustable pin (VIBRATION_MOTOR_PIN; default: built-in LED pin of board, which is pin 13 on the MEGA) and with adjustable vibration time (VIBRATION_TIME_MS; default: 200 ms)


    ![Page 1](/doc/resources/cerea-remote-page1.jpg ""Page 1"") ![Page 2](/doc/resources/cerea-remote-page2.jpg ""Page 2"")

**Necessary Hardware**

- [Arduino MEGA 2560](https://store.arduino.cc/mega-2560-r3)
- 3.5"" TFT/touchscreen shield (480x320; 16 bit colors) supported by the Adafruit TFTLCD and Touchscreen library (tested: [Kuman version with ILI9486](https://www.amazon.com/Kuman-Arduino-Screen-Tutorials-Mega2560/dp/B075FP83V5/); more can be added)
- *If USB serial connection is used:* capacitor (>22 µF)
- Optional: vibration motor (e.g. [seeed Groove VM](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/Grove-c-1003/Grove-Vibration-Motor.html))
- Optional: relay(s)  (e.g. [seeed Groove 2CH Relay](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-2-Channel-SPDT-Relay-p-3118.html))

*Important if a USB serial connection is used:* Per default the Arduino resets completely as soon as a serial connection is opened. For some reason in case of the Cerea output the board thinks it is flashed and thus freezes. To avoid this the auto reset must be disabled via a capacitor (>22 µF) between the reset and ground pin.

Riku from the German [Cerea forum](http://cerea-forum.de/) built an excellent housing for the Arduino and was nice enough to provide all necessary resources (German). Have look at the basics [here](https://cerea-forum.de/forum/index.php?thread/440-externe-touchscreen-bedieneinheit-bauanleitung/) and the extension [here](https://cerea-forum.de/forum/index.php?thread/493-externe-touchscreen-bedieneinheit-automatisierte-schaltung/). **PLEASE NOTE: This housing is only compatible with releases before 0.2.2, as it does not account for the button shift introduced by the boombox state indicators. Please use [Release 0.2.1](https://github.com/danrauch/arduino-cerea-remote-control/releases/tag/v0.2.1) if you intend to use the housing.**

**Dependencies**

To use this sketch the following libraries must be downloaded and imported to the Arduino IDE. Either download them directly with the provided links and import them (""Sketch""->""Add .ZIP Library"") or search them in the Arduino IDE Library Manager (""Tools""->""Library Manager"").

[Cerea](https://www.cereagps.com/) is an agricultural GPS auto-steer system for Windows, developed by a Spain-based company called SOLUCIONES TECNOLOGICAS CEREA.

It uses serial communication to exchange command sequences, which allow to remote control the system from any device with a serial interface. The following commands were reverse engineered, so no guarantee!

General information:

- ""1"" represents on/true
- ""0"" represents off/false
- every command is followed by a CR-LF (`\r\n`)

### **Cerea > Remote**

Commands seem to arrive in 0.5 second cycles (confirmation needed).

Since it is my first game, it was bound to be coded horribly from the very start. However, it works, and that's all that mattered back in the Jefferson Years.","# Farming In The Jefferson Years

I created this game in 2018, during the time that I was in AP Programming A, a time before my teacher taught me what a ""class"" or ""array"" was. My US History teacher created this game to show how much of a gamble farming used to be during the Westward Expansion, and I decided to port it to Java in one day, over nine long hours. This game is a simple one. Just buy some livestock or seeds and hope that you can make a profit by selling your items at the end of the year after prices have fluctuated. However, unlike in a stock market simulator where prices fluctuate for everyone, the prices that you, the farmer, must pay to buy livestock and seeds each year are fixed. I wish you good luck, farmer, for you are going to need it.

Computercraft, turtle building a cactus farm

  - Vertical passive cactus farm 3x3
  - Turtle gradually builds the farm stage by stage, as and when it is provided with the necessary resources.
  - When sky limit is reached, program files is renamed as TooHig_filename.lua to prevent unnecessary maneuvers.

### Prerequisites

CC:Tweaked 1.83.1 ( https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked )

### Installing

Pastebin : https://pastebin.com/2SPDSxPt

```
pastebin get 2SPDSxPt build.lua
```

## Design

Based on a 3x3 tower for passive farming. When cactus grow up items will pop and fall on the floor. Build a pool below with water streams to harvest products.
![Cactus farm stages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/absolument/CC-CactusFarmBuilder/master/2019-07-16_13.54.35.png)
![Cactus farm base](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/absolument/CC-CactusFarmBuilder/master/2019-07-16_15.24.26.png)

## Usage

![Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/absolument/CC-CactusFarmBuilder/master/2019-07-16_15.28.30.png)

Place your turtle on the floor (Full of fuel as far as possible), facing the center of cactus tower farm, at 3 blocks of distance.
Build the first stage of the cactus farm tower.
Then run the program, provide any materials.

For one stage, at least :
  - 4 cactus,
  - 4 sand,
  - 4 cobblestone
  - 2 fences
  - 1 torch

On inventory events, the number of stages the turtle can build is updated.
Presse Enter to start building. Then turtle will walk to the center and go up to the next stage to build and start to work. When job is done, the turtle will return to start position.

## Custom

If you choose other start position, edit theses parts :

```
function ascent()
	output(""Ascent phase"")
	
	--take place in the center
	output(""Align to center"")
	for i=1,3 do -- <--EDIT
		turtle.forward()
	end
```

```
function descent()
	output(""Descent"")
	repeat
		local move = turtle.down()
	until not move
	output(""Repositionning"")
	for i=1,3 do -- <--EDIT
		turtle.back()
	end
end
```

This research project focuses on the development of a versatile agricultural robot powered by solar energy and operated through an infrared remote control. The robot performs various tasks in the agricultural field, including soil plowing, seed planting, grass cutting, and crop watering. The system converts solar power into electrical energy using solar panels, which is then stored in a rechargeable battery. The robot comprises essential components such as a microcontroller (Atmega328), motor driver (L298N), gear motors, water pump, grass cutter, lead-acid battery, and solar panel.

## Introduction

The integration of robotic technology in agriculture has the potential to reduce labor costs, working hours, safety risks, and environmental impacts. Robotic automation offers enhanced productivity in farming operations, including plowing, seed sowing, grass cutting, and crop watering. These operations are powered by a combination of battery and solar energy. The robot is controlled through an infrared remote control, enabling easy operation for farmers.

## Seed Sowing Operation

The traditional method of seed sowing based on assumptions of seed spacing and depth placement is inefficient and labor-intensive. To address this, the developed robot automates the seed sowing process, eliminating the need for manual labor and reducing strain on farmers.

## Grass Cutting Operation

Unwanted grass is cut using a high RPM DC motor with a stainless-steel blade attached to the bottom of the robot. This automated process ensures efficient grass cutting without manual effort.

## Plant Watering Operation

The robot includes a designed water sprayer using a mini water pump powered by a 12-volt DC supply. This mechanism facilitates automated watering of crops, eliminating the need for manual labor.

## Materials and Methodology

## Hardware Components

- **DC 12 V Gear Motors**: These motors produce high torque while maintaining low horsepower, making them suitable for various applications in robotics.
- **Motor Driver L298N**: This integrated circuit is a high-voltage, high-current dual full-bridge driver designed to drive inductive loads such as motors, relays, and solenoids.
- **Solar Panel**: A set of interconnected solar photovoltaic modules that generate electricity from sunlight. The solar panel provides a renewable energy source for powering the robot.
- **IR Remote & Receiver**: The infrared remote control serves as the input device for operating the robot, and the IR receiver sensor detects the signals from the remote control.
- **Microcontroller Atmega328**: The microcontroller acts as the central control unit for the robot, receiving signals from the IR receiver and generating commands to control various robot operations.

## Software Description (Arduino IDE)

The Arduino IDE is used for writing and compiling the code for the robot. It provides an easy-to-use platform for programming the microcontroller and uploading the code to the Arduino module. The IDE supports both C and C++ languages and offers debugging, editing, and compilation features.


## Results

The robot's operation is based on signals received from the IR receiver sensor via the IR remote control. These signals are decoded by the microcontroller, which generates commands to control the robot's various operations. The solar panel collects sunlight and converts it into electrical energy, which is stored in a lead-acid battery. This stored power is then utilized to power the robot's motors and other components.

## Conclusion

The solar-powered agricultural robot presented in this research paper offers significant benefits for farmers, reducing their efforts and time investment. The automation provided by this robot minimizes the need for manual labor and improves the efficiency of farming operations. Future developments could involve integrating programmable logic controllers (PLC) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for full automation.

## TRABAJO DE FIN DE GRADO. Fadming
#### Realizada por Eduardo Escobar Alberto

##### Introducción
El proyecto consiste en la elaboración de una aplicación en Android para el tratamiento y cuidado de fincas.
El objetivo es llevar un seguimiento personalizado de cada una de las plantas que integran el terreno cultivado, para ello, cada una tendrá un código QR asociado, que le irá indicando al cliente el estado en que se encuentra. Si el agricultor realiza un nuevo proceso sobre la planta, desde la propia aplicación se actualizará el estado de la misma, para en el siguiente paso conocer el punto del proceso en el que se encuentra dicha planta.
La aplicación tendrá la posibilidad de añadir nuevos clientes, nuevas fincas, nuevas plantas, etc. Todo esto a través de una aplicación web conectada a la base de datos.

##### Antecedentes y estado actual del tema
Buscando en varios lugares de la red o en PlayStore (mercado de aplicaciones de Android) no se ha encontrado nada similar, ya que hay que tener muy en cuenta que este proyecto es **idea del tutor**, añadiendo al trabajo el incentivo de ser algo novedoso.
Sí que podrían existir aplicaciones que permitan la gestión de cualquier aspecto de forma genérica, es decir, aplicaciones con recordatorios o con la posibilidad de almacenar tablas con cualquier tipo de datos. Pero no existe nada tan concreto en este tema y que se realice a través de este tipo de códigos.

# MusicalChairs
Agent-based model representing the competition for land between stakeholders of farming and herding.


This Agent-Based model intends to explore the conditions for the emergence and change of land use patterns in Central Asian oases and similar contexts. Land use pattern is conceptualized as the proportion between the area used for mobile livestock breeding (herding) and sedentary agriculture (farming). We assume that these two forms of land use interact in recurrent competitive situations, given that the land useful for both activities at the same time is limited and there is a pressure to increase them, due to demographic and/or economic growth. Implementation and simulation of the Musical Chairs model were done using Netlogo.

# AgroShare
Despite the fact that agriculture accounts for as much as a quarter of the Indian economy and employs an estimated 60 percent of the labor force, it is considered highly inefficient, wasteful, and incapable of solving the hunger and malnutrition problems. Despite progress in this area, these problems have continued to frustrate India for decades. It is estimated that as much as one-fifth of the total agricultural output is lost due to inefficiencies in harvesting, transport, and storage of government-subsidized crops. Solving these issues will play a significant role in the socio-economic condition of this country. And the past year was all about the motion of decentralization and giving the right of consumers data in their own hand and privacy and bridging the concept of how blockchain will change the world for good of the people. So we bring a simple proof of concept where we demonstrate how the concept of a community and decentralization can help farmers grow economically & socially. Investments in agriculture sounds pretty inept for a normal consumer, we break this idea and now we introduce the concept of general investment and shareholding in the agriculture ecosystem. Using Blockchain our concept guarantees a 100 percent transparent   system in an end to end model, which means the farmer will be assured that what is paid for in the market for his produce is at par with the maximum profit possible because we remove the involvement of a lot of middle men between the farmer and the market leading to a higher profit to both retailer and the farmer. Having a structured community helps the idea of shared growth and learning which leverage the involvement of very poor farmers directly in the market directly, the two major benefits we project here is the overall risk in agriculture space is reduced because of the community support every farmer receives from the other fellow in that respective community and the overall production reach to the market will increase as the production will be from the whole community and from individual farmers. We now introduce the idea of task and reputation. Unorganised sector, also known as own account enterprises, refers to all unlicensed, self-employed or unregistered economic activity such as owner manned general stores, handicrafts and handloom workers, rural traders, farmers, etc. The idea of task is derived from the fact that it will allow every daily wage worker to participate in the community work in a structured way allowing them correct wage and the opportunity bringing them to the formal sector in this country. Reputations are another part of this concept of community is the about giving back and someway helping the community grow though your involvement in it which in return can be used for several purposes like buying seed etc.


# Project Wireframe 


![framework](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IlAv71SGDj0hNUSoo_fV3QlA2Z92de4J/view?usp=sharing) 

This is the wireframe of our platform where we try to bring in everyone starting right from the investor which can be you to the farmer to the shareholder and even the panchayat and the people who are selling it to retail or the wholesale.
So talking about the working!
Using this platform is very simple. 
- Shareholder/ Investor - sure, you want to invest in the agricultural ecosystem and looking for a return.The strategy is simple you invest in any of the given community with a percentage of stake you want to buy and keep it just like normal investment in any company. With the growth in agricultural yield and community development the price of the stock increase and then it’ your choice to hold it or sell it.
- Farmer - you have some land (be a part of a community). What it takes you may ask? You have to have your identification card and your asset details of your land and some proprietary details of what you grow and that's all about it.  
- Daily wager - see what jobs are around you. Take up the job you like.

This idea will always keep the cash flow in the agriculture industry and farmers can now take out money from the community for the resources they need with/without load from the bank.

A farmer friendly bot to solve the problems of the farmers with machine learning

## What is Technofarm ?

We have found that many farmers in india face the problem of getting accurate insights about their crop. Farmers try to make their best guess for predicting but they are not right for most of the times. For solving this issue we have come up with an autonomous bot which could move on the field and make predictions for the crop below.

## Components

MERN + Python

### 1. Backend

- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, MongoDB
- **Description**: The backend server is responsible for collecting data from the Raspberry Pi, handling user input via WebSocket, and storing data in a MongoDB database.

### 2. Frontend

- **Technology Stack**: React.js
- **Description**: The frontend is a user interface built with React.js, using WebSocket connections to communicate with the backend. It displays real-time data and allows users to interact with the IoT system.

### 3. IoT Device (Raspberry Pi)

- **Technology Stack**: Python
- **Description**: The Raspberry Pi runs a Python script to communicate with the backend via HTTP POST requests and WebSockets. It collects data from various sensors and can trigger actuators based on user commands.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run this IoT system locally, follow these steps:

1. **Backend Setup**: 
   - Clone this repository.
   - Navigate to the `server` directory.
   - Install the required Node.js packages by running `npm install`.
   - Start the backend server with `nodemon`.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the `client` directory.
   - Install the necessary dependencies with `npm install`.
   - Start the frontend with `npm start`.

3. **Raspberry Pi Setup**:
   - Set up your Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS.
   - Clone this repository on your Pi.
   - Navigate to the `python-scripts` directory.
   - Run the `rpi-scripy-new` script on your Pi.
   - Also you have to interface all the sensors with GPIOs of pi
	   - you can also use 	Arduino to connect sensors and use serial communication between Pi and Arduino, code for this is in `rpi-script` in `python-scripts` directory

SuperFarmer是MXPOOL推出的Chia及Chia分叉币多挖程序。

 * 收益高, 一个程序可以同时挖10个以上收益最高的分叉币
 * 速度快, 无需同步节点，安装后可立即耕种
 * 安装易, 只需要运行一个程序，安装配置简单
 * 配置活, 可动态设置想挖的币种
 * 轻量级, 程序绿色轻量，压缩后只有6M，运行后占用很少的系统资源
 * 收益稳定, 进入矿池可获得稳定收益
 * 提现方便, 不同分叉币的收益，可统一折算成xch提取

注意: 系统还在测试阶段，会有一些问题，请试验性的使用。

## 安装使用
 * [SuperFarmer 安装使用](https://github.com/mx-pool/super-farmer/wiki/SuperFarmer-%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97)
 * SuperFarmer 升级: 解压后覆盖之前的版本文件
 
## 账号注册 & 后台使用
 * 打开 https://mxpool.org 进行账号注册
 * 登录 https://mxpool.org/login
 * 打开用户中心页面 https://mxpool.org/uc/assets 

## 常见问题
 * SuperFarmer是如何工作的?
 
 SuperFarmer是一个兼容Chia协议的客户端，工作原理和chia基本一样。工作过程: 接收网络中的challenge, 在图(plot)文件中寻找证明(proof of space), 找到合适的证明后提交到full_node。区别在于SuperFarmer同时连接到多个分叉网络，同时接收各个网络中的challenge，并提交证明。还有一个区别在于superfarmer不需要本地运行full_node，启动后可立即开始耕种。
 * SuperFarmer是否会使用密钥，是否泄露密钥?
 
 SuperFarmer和官方的chia以相同的方式使用密钥，耕种过程中只会使用farmer key和pool key，用来签名证明(ProofOfSpace)。助记符/farmer key/pool key等私钥均不会上传到网络，只有公钥和签名是会上传到网络。
 * 如何确保钱包密钥安全?
 
 为确保钱包密钥的安全，建议P图/耕种的密钥和钱包的密钥分开。即在一台非耕种的机器上创建一个新的钱包助记符,和耕种使用不同的密钥。
 
 * SuperFarmer 支持NFT plot吗
 
 SuperFarmer 同时支持老图和新图(NFT), 请注意新图目前只能拿到1/8的收益， 关于另外7/8的收益的如何获取，我们会进一步研究可行方案。

Auto replanter is a small modification that aims to improve farming experience in Minecraft,
by automatically replanting crops when you harvest them.

[![Super-Linter check](https://github.com/cichu/minecraft-auto-replanter/actions/workflows/lint-main-branch.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cichu/minecraft-auto-replanter/actions/workflows/lint-main-branch.yml)

   1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
   2. [Installation](#installation)
3. [Roadmap](#roadmap)
4. [How to report a bug or request new feature](#reporting-bugs-or-requesting-features)

## About the mod
For auto replanting to work you need to use a tool when harvesting.

Here is a list of tools with crops they can harvest:
- Shears
  - Wheat
- Hoe
  - Beetroots
  - Carrots
  - Potatoes
- Axe
  - Cocoa beans

Once you have a proper tool in hand, you can simply right-click respective, fully grown crop.
This will harvest it and plant the same type of crop in its place.

Harvesting crop this way drops one less seed item than by gathering it in the regular way.
For crops that don't have a separate seed item (i.e. carrot or potato) the number of harvested crop items is decreased by one instead.
This means that regardless if you harvest using a tool or in the regular way - by punching and planting them manually - the number of gathered crops and seeds should be the same.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
To use this mod you need to have Minecraft with Fabric loader installed.  
Instructions how to install Fabric loader can be found [here](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/install).

### Installation
1. Download the latest version from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/cichu/minecraft-auto-replanter/releases) for your version of Minecraft.
   > Each release has 2 JAR files attached.  
   > Download the one **WITHOUT** the word ""sources"" in its name.
2. Move the downloaded file into mods folder inside your Minecraft installation folder.

## Roadmap
- [x] Use different harvesting tools for different crops
- [ ] Allow harvesting more crops
  - [x] Cocoa beans
  - [ ] Nether warts
- [ ] Add ability to put looting enchantment on the harvesting tools

## Reporting bugs or requesting features
Both bug reports and feature requests are handled through [issues tab](https://github.com/cichu/minecraft-auto-replanter/issues).
Before opening new issue check if there isn't one similar to yours.  
If you find one that matches your needs comment on it or add a reaction to let me know that there is interest in it.

## Dependencies:<br/>
:wrench: __sp__-package, for geometry types<br/>
:wrench: __data.table__-package, as faster alternative for _base::data.frame_<br/>
:wrench: __FNN__-package, for k-nearest-neighbor search algorithm<br/>

## Parameters:<br/>
- Input: _SpatialDataPointsDataFrame_, georeferenced point data with attribute(s)<br/>
- Input: _k_, number of neighbours taken into account (as in _k-Nearest-Neighbor_)<br/>
- Output: _data.table_, containing index and the corresponding _averaged difference_ in decreasing order<br/><br/>

The function returns a list (data.table) with points indices and the _averaged difference_ of the respective point. The data.table allows for the deletion of the top _n_ outliers by their indices. The actual number of outliers to be deleted can be freely chosen by the user.<br/>
For the example shown, 1.200 points (of ~ 8.000 points) were deleted. The nearest neighbors considered (_k_) was (arbitrarily) set to 355. Chosen parameter values should orient on the absolute amount of data points and the ""severity"" of the visible measurement errors. Global outliers can be obtained for larger neighborhoods, while smaller neighborhoods are especially suitable to identify local outliers on a smaller spatial scale.<br/>

Execution time for 8.000 point observations: ~3 sec.

## Problems 

One of the significant issues in organic farming is that certifications are required from multiple parties for
the products to be deemed ‘organic’. Currently, there are two government sanctioned mechanisms
for issuance of certification:

1. PGS Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS): Farmers in a group inspect each other’s land
and vouch for its organic credentials. The inspection is carried out at the start of every sowing
season and farmers visit each other almost weekly to provide counsel. If a farmer is found
to be in violation, her produce is not sold through the group till she rectifies her mistake.

2. Third party certification: The farms is certified by authorized third party certifying agencies.
The database of India’s organic products is very poor and traceability, which is key for export growth,
remains weak, while third party certification as insisted by APEDA is very costly. In addition, major
markets for export do not accepts PGS certification, and there is no mechanism to link certifications
by third parties and PGS. 

## Solution

GreenTrust offers a solution for obtaining certification in organic farming by organizing credible and decentralized Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGSs). 

In order to secure certification, every harvest must be sponsored by certified farmers who contribute a stake as a form of assurance that organic farming methods have been properly implemented. 

The platform utilizes decentralized IoT sensor data to monitor and track various environmental conditions. Additionally, any individual may challenge the organic authenticity of a particular harvest on the platform. 

These challenges are then evaluated by a certified inspector, and if the challenge is deemed to be valid, the challenger will receive the stake put forward for the harvest.

Conversely, if the challenge is found to be invalid, the challenger will lose the stake they put forward to initiate the challenge.

### 

#### Farmer
-  A Farmer joins the GreenTrust Platform for using the decentralized PGS system of verification for his organic Crops.
-  The onboarding of Farmers is simplified by using Arcana Auth which provides a seamless interface from Web2 to Web3.
-  This provides him a platform to gain credibility for his crops without paying high third party certification fees. (Incentive)
-  In doing so, a farmer pays a nominal subscription fee in terms of Superfluid's CFA (Continuous Flow Agreement) money streaming model.
-  The farmer can request stakes to be placed on his farm by stakeholders by clicking on Request Stake button, which sends a Push Notification to everyone subscribed to the GreenTrust Channel.
  
#### Verifier
- A Verifier is an authorized Organic Crop Verifier associated with our platform.
- The Verifier will get allocated with inspecting a Challenged Crop randomly through our system. (Future Work)
- Since the Crop challenges will be randomly allocated the bias in the verifier's judgement will be highly reduced.
- Verifier can either approve or reject a challenge after inspecting the challenged crop.
- Verifier always gets the same amount (his inspection fee) irrespective of his decision which reduces his bias further.(Incentive)
 
#### Stakeholder 
- A Stakeholder is a person who vouches for the credibility of an organic crop by placing a certain amount as stake.
- After a certain duration from the crop's harvest, the stake amount will be returned to all the stakeholders and a reward will be given using Superfluid's IDA (Instant Distribution Agreement) model automatically using Chainlink Upkeep. (Incentive)
- Stakeholder's Rewards are generated from the farmer's subscriptions by the smart contract deployed on Polygon.
- If a challenge on the crop is approved by a verifier, then the stakeholder loses his stake amount.
 
#### Consumer
- Consumer is the one who consumes the farmer's organic products.
- The organic products will have QR codes which can be scanned to access the Crop details like Crop Health data (Uploaded through an IoT device), Challenges on the crop, stakeholders, etc.
- The consumer can challenge an organic crop harvest's credibility by placing a challenge and staking a certain amount.
- If the verifier approves the challenge, the Stakeholders' stakes are transferred to the consumer as a compensation amount and his stake (the one he placed to challenge) is transferred to the Verifier as a fee. (Incentive)
- If the verifier rejects the challenge, the consumer loses his staked amount to the Verifier (as a fee).

## Advantages

- <b>Establishing traceability</b>: Placing information regarding the lifecycle of crops on a
blockchain will help improving trust in the self certification process and establishing
traceability at the point of sale.

- <b>Disintermediation of multiple stakeholders</b>: As highlighted, the process of third party
certification is often expensive, and in turn drives up cost of produce, making it harder for
farmers to sell. Disintermediation through peer to peer certification mechanisms, or
integration of third party certifiers into the PGS process would unlock large markets for
produce and reduce cost of production.

- <b> Programmable transfers </b>: Much like in supply chain, tracking of products using IoT devices
along their value chain can help increase efficiency in transfer of asset between
stakeholders, and alert stakeholders immediately of issues.

#### Data
To try BovHEAT on your machine and generate the output for yourself, download the zipped example data
 from [example/output/data_zipped.zip](example/data/data_zipped.zip).
Run the BovHeat in parent folder according to the steps below. The column language is eng.

## Download and Usage

#### 1. Download
We provide a one-file executable for Windows, Linux and macOS.  
Download the zipped executable corresponding to your OS from the [latest BovHEAT release](https://github.com/bovheat/bovheat/releases/latest). 
#### 2. SCR files and folder structure
Place the BovHEAT executable in the folder containing SCR files in the XLSX or XLS format.
Alternatively, you can group SCR files in folders and put BovHEAT in the parent folder.
Cow IDs have to be unique in the data or unique within folders.
Therefore, we recommend you use one of the following two folder structures.
```
├── farm1                          OR           ├── farm1_scr_file1.xlsx 
│   ├── farm1_scr_file1.xlsx                    ├── farm1_scr_file2.xlsx 
│   └── farm1_scr_file2.xlsx                    ├── farm1_scr_file3.xlsx 
├── farm2                                       └── BovHEAT executable 
│   ├── farm2_scr_file1.xlsx    
│   └── farm2_scr_file2.xlsx    
└── BovHEAT executable         
```
#### 3. Run BovHEAT and select parameters
Execute BovHEAT, wait a few seconds for it to start and enter the following information.

`Column header language`  
Column language of the SCR files  

`Start and Stop DIM`  
Choose the start and stop DIM to select the observation interval.  
As an example: Start -5 and Stop 35 would include 5 days before till 35 days after calving.  

`Threshold`  
Choose the desired threshold for estrus detection. Recommended is a threshold of 35.  

`Minimum heat length`   
Choose a minimum number of heat observations required to count as a heat. Default is 1.

Based on: ""Raw data from Yellow Sticky Traps with insects for training of deep learning Convolutional Neural Network for object detection"" by A.T. Nieuwenhuizen et. al. ","# Yellow Sticky Traps Dataset
This dataset contains images of yellow sticky traps and bounding box annotations for three classes of flying insects found in greenhouses.
The annotated classes are Macrolophus pygmaeus, Nesidiocoris tenuis and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Whitefly).

The dataset is based on the original version **""Raw data from Yellow Sticky Traps with insects for training of deep learning Convolutional Neural Network for object detection""** by **A.T. Nieuwenhuizen et. al.** (see [source](https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Raw_data_from_Yellow_Sticky_Traps_with_insects_for_training_of_deep_learning_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_object_detection/12707066)).
This version contains corrected annotations and uniform image orientations.

## Details
The yellow sticky dataset consists of:
* 284 **landscape JPEG images** of **5184 x 3456 px**
* 8114 **bounding box** annotations:
    * 1619 **Macrolophus pygmaeus**
    * 688 **Nesidiocoris tenuis**
    * 5807 **Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Whitefly)**

Compared to the original dataset by **A.T. Nieuwenhuizen et. al.** the Exif image rotation information were fixed to match the landscape-oriented images.

Additionally, the annotation quality was improved by labeling previously unlabeled objects, fixing wrong labeled classes, resizing bounding boxes and improving the location of bounding boxes.

The annotations were improved with [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg), created by Tzutalin. Ground truth information is stored in XML files in PASCAL VOC format.

The labeling process was carried out to the best of our knowledge.

This repository contains all the code related to [DeepWay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16322), a deep learning model able to predict the position of waypoints useful for global path planning of autonomous unmanned robots in row-crop fields.

# 1 Getting Started
## 1.1 Installation

1. Clone this repository

``` git clone  https://github.com/fsalv/DeepWay.git ```

2. Install the required packages

``` 
cd DeepWay
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We recommend to do it in a separate virtual environment with respect to your main one to avoid compatibility issues for packages versions. In this case, remember to create a jupyter kernel linked to the new environment.

**Warning** If you don't have gpu available or if you have CUDA issues all calculations will be performed by your CPU.

# 2 Network training

Run the jupyter notebook ```Artificial Dataset Generator.ipynb``` to generate the random synthethic dataset. You can modify useful parameters in the first cells of the notebook.

You can re-train DeepWay on the new generated dataset with the notebook ```DeepWay Train.ipynb```. You can modify network parameters inside the configuration file  ```utils/config.json```. In particular, by modifying the ```DATA_N``` and ```DATA_N_VAL``` values you can choose to train/validate with fewer images to see how prediction quality changes with dataset dimension. You can also modify the network architecture changing ```K```, ```MASK_DIM```, the number of ```FILTERS``` per layer or the ```KERNEL_SIZE```.

You can test DeepWay on both the satellite and synthethic test datasets with the notebook ```DeepWay Test.ipynb```. This notebooks allows you to compute the AP metric on the selected images. You can change the test set inside the notebook in the section *Import the Test Dataset*. If you set ```name_model = 'deep_way_pretrained.h5'``` in the third cell, you can use the weights pretrained by us.

**Warning** If you don't have gpu support, comment the third cell (*""select a GPU and set memory growth""*) on both the training and testing notebooks.

# 3 Path planning
<p align=""center"">
  <img src=media/deepway.png>
</p>
To generate the paths with the A* algorithm and compute the coverage metric, you can use the ``` Prediction and Path Planning.ipynb``` notebook. Again, you can change the test set inside the notebook to select satellite or synthethic datasets. Note that the A* execution will require a lot of time, exspecially if it finds some trouble in generating the path for too narrow masks.
<br/><br/>

**Warning:** If you don't have gpu support, comment the fourth cell (*""select a GPU and set memory growth""*).

<sub> <b> Note on the satellite dataset: </b> </br>
The 100 masks of the real-world remote-sensed dataset have been derived by manual labeling of images taken from Google Maps. Google policy for the products of its satellite service can be found [here](https://www.google.com/permissions/geoguidelines/). Images can be used for reasearch purposes by giving the proper attribution to the owner. However, for this repository we chose to release the masks only and not the original satellite images. </sub>

# how to install

## with *conda* (we used *miniconda3*)

1. download the project
2. create a conda environment and run the following command: `conda install rasterio=1.3.3 geopandas=0.12.1 -c conda-forge`
3. then, run the command: `pip install sentinelsat==1.1.1 xmltodict==0.13.0`

# how to use

create a csv file with the columns:

```
polygon_id;polygon_wkt;dt_from;dt_to
<unique_polygon_id_0>;<polygon_wkt_0>;<YYYY-mm-dd>;<YYYY-mm-dd>
.
.
.
<unique_polygon_id_1>;<polygon_wkt_1>;<YYYY-mm-dd>;<YYYY-mm-dd>
```

then, run `python products.py --csv-path <path_to_csv_file>`. there are other arguments, see with `python products.py -h`
you will see that a `products-polygons.csv` was created.

use it as input to the next script, running: `python rasters.py --csv-path <path_to_output_of_products.py>`. if everything goes ok, it will be created a folder named `rasters` and subfolders named with the poygons unique id. inside these subfolders you will see the downloaded raster files ready to be used.

This repository holds the code implemented in the two following papers:

1. ""Ensemble Learning for Improving Generalization in Aeroponics Yield Prediction"" being presented at the IEEE conference ISCAS 2020 in Spain.
2. ""Interpretability of AI Models that use Data Fusion to Predict Yield in Aeroponics"", published in the Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing.

# Ensemble Learning for Improving Generalization in Aeroponics Yield Prediction

The first part of this repository corresponds to the Python implementation for the first paper.

In this work, yield prediction in aeroponics is studied using ML. We have compared and analyzed three popular supervised ML methods - Dense Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest based on decision trees (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Air quality and water quality measurements including temperature, humidity, CO2 , pH and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are used for yield prediction. Other static inputs such as number of days before and after transplant are also used. Six crops are studied (garlic chives, basil, red chard, rainbow chard, arugula, and mint). DNN performs particularly well with the prediction. The root mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R^2) are calculated to estimate the efficiency of the method. Mean square error and R^2 score of DNN are 0.10 and 0.67, RF follows DNN correctness with MSE and R^2 of 0.12 and 0.62, and SVR achieves 0.18 and 0.45 respectively, all of these values over the validation dataset. In addition to individual models, the two top performing models are combined as an ensemble model to improve overall performance, which shows an average R^2 score over the whole dataset divided by crop of 0.81.

This part of the project contains 4 files (Jupyter notebooks): NeuralNetwork, RandomForest, and SupportVectorMachine have the code that trains those three models. The file named Predictions contains the code that generates the final results using the already trained models.

# Interpretability of AI Models that use Data Fusion to Predict Yield in Aeroponics

The second part of this repository corresponds to the Python implementation for the second paper.

This paper has two main goals: (i) use data fusion to improve yield prediction in aeroponics, and (ii) find which features are more relevant for yield prediction of the six crops. To reach these goals, a number of artificial intelligence models and an interpretability analysis based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) have been implemented. The models were trained using 200 samples that were collected for almost a year, including information from different air and water quality sensors besides manually recorded data, reaching in the end a coefficient of determination value R2 = 0.752 for the validation dataset in the best case (CNN-based model). As a result, two main features were identified in the dataset: Room CO2 and Reservoir Temperature, along with other useful insights of how these features influence predictions. SHAP values also provided important information for feature selection.

The models originally presented in the first paper have been re-trained with different regularization parameters for this work, achieving better
performance metrics (MAE and MSE could not be compared due to the usage of different units). These models constitute the baseline for the models that use data fusion. The training process of all the algorithms involved repeated cross validation, and grid search for hyperparameters in some cases.

Our AI models were implemented in Python 3.7, using Scikit Learn 0.22 for SVR and RF, and Tensorflow 2.0 for the other models. They were trained on a dedicated server with 64 Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6130 CPU's at 2.10GHz, 1.6 TB of RAM, and a Nvidia Tesla V100-PCIE-16GB GPU.

**Figure 1**: Sharpness assessment for the dataset used in this study. The calculated sharpness matches the manual assessment of this dataset, 
as images 04, 05, 06 and 10 from the trainval dataset were relatively 
sharper as the other captures. The test-set captures were degraded 
with different degrees of motion blur with 01, 02 and 03 being blurred 
the most. The color code matches in the sub-figures. **a** Relative 
Sharpness Value based on TVoL. Lower values indicate a higher degree 
of motion blur. Most captures in the dataset were blurred, but there 
were also some relatively sharper images present. **b** Flight plan of the
used dataset showing the location of the captures. Gray dots indicate 
captures that were not annotated. Relatively sharp captures were located
at the edges of the flight plan, where the drone was flying slower 
to rotate, as indicated by the limegreen, brown, pink, yellow and cyan
dots. **c** Example patches from the captures, where color of the border
indicates the corresponding capture.

## Results on the Test-Set
The results of the best performing model (UNet + ResNet-34) are shown.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 1.11.0
- Compatible Graphics Card with CUDA >9 and cuDNN installed

## Installation
1. Clone this project
```
git clone git@github.com:grimmlab/UAVWeedSegmentation.git
```

2. Install requirements
```
cd UAVWeedSegmentation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download and install pytorch with GPU support that is compatible with your GPU

4. Download trained model from Mendeley Data (https://doi.org/10.17632/4hh45vkp38.5) and paste the unzipped model in `/models`.
Rename the model to `model_unet_resnet34_dil0_bilin1_retrained.pt` to match the parsing of the script `predict_testset`.
## Predict on new UAV images
Now, we can predict weeds in new UAV images using following script:
```
python3 save_patches.py
python3 predict_testset.py [model_path] [subset]
# example
python3 save_patches.py
python3 predict_testset.py models/model_unet_resnet34_dil0_bilin1_retrained.pt test
```
where:
- model_path is the path to the trained model `.pt` file
- subset is the name of the folder in `/data` to predict on.

## Compare Predictions with Ground Truth
For final evaluation, we compare the models predictions with the Ground Truth of a hold-out test set that was annotated manually by agronomy experts. This script generates Figures 3 and 5 of our paper. These figures are saved in `/results/predictions/<subset>`.

```
python3 compare_predictions.py [subset] [--bbch]
# example for comparing predictions and ground truth on the hold-out test set
python3 compare_predictions.py test
# example for comparing predictions and ground truth on the additional test images
python3 compare_predictions.py test_different_bbch --bbch 15
python3 compare_predictions.py test_different_bbch --bbch 19
```
where:
- subset is the name of the folder in `/data` to predict on.
- bbch is the BBCH stage of the UAV captures. Only used for subset `test_different_bbch` and can be either 15 or 19.


## Train new Models
1. Generate patches from images and annotations
```
python3 save_patches.py
```

2. Train DL Model
```
python3 train.py [architecture] [feature_extractor]
# example
python3 train.py fcn resnet50
```
where:
- architecture is either ""fcn8s"", ""fcn16s"", ""fcn32s"", ""unet"" or ""dlplus""
- feature_extractor is either ""resnet18"", ""resnet34"", ""resnet50"" or ""resnet101""
- --replace_stride_with_dilation, if using dilation

## Examine Training Databases
When using the script `train.py`, a database will be saved in `results/` containing all trials in this study. There is an own database for each feature extractor and architecture. The studies trained for the publication are saved in several subfolders in `results/studies` can be examined to select the best model architecture and feature extractor. Therefore, change the path in the script `compare_studies.py`. Additionally, Table 3 of the Paper can be generated using this script.

```
python3 compare_studies.py
```

## Re-train on the complete trainval set
A freshly initialized model will be trained on the complete training and validation set using the best hyperparameters and model architecture. 

```
python3 retrain.py [architecture] [feature_extractor]
# example
python3 retrain.py unet resnet34
```

## Project goal

The intention of this project is to enhance the open source guidance system [AgOpenGPS](https://github.com/farmerbriantee/AgOpenGPS) with a option to do precision farming, especially applying herbicide to small spots of weed.

## Current Setup / Components

### AGTracker Android App

To determine and track the areas in the field where herbicide shall be apllied, we developed the Android based app AGTracker that acts as a tracking device for GPS coordinates.

In a nutshell, you click a button on the app and the app starts to record GPS points wherever you move. With this tracking, you can walk around a spot of weeds in the field and AGTracker is creating a GPS point cloud in the background. This data can then be exported to QGIS for further processing.

![Start recording](/docs/images/Screenshot_area_tracking_start1.png)
![Start recording](/docs/images/screenshot_area_tracking_1.png)

[Demo Video](https://youtu.be/wDYr2NimR5c)

To enable a high degree of accurracy, the app gets the GPS coordinates by an Ardusimple F9P GPS receiver with NTRIP data correction. The GPS handling is done via the [Lefebure NTRIP Client](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lefebure.ntripclient&hl=de&gl=US) and forwarded to the AG Tracker app as GPS mock signal.

### QGIS processing

After export of the GPS data from the app QGIS is used to visualize the data, to enable the option to manually edit the data if needed and process further to be usuable for AgOpenGPS.

![Weed spots](/docs/images/screenshot_qgis_unkraut.png)
![Weed spots processed](/docs/images/screenshot_qgs_processed.png)

Handover to AGOpenGPS is done by automated creation of a Sections-File to ""mock"" AGOpenGPS that every place in the specific field has been already applied besides the weed spots. Therefore in QGIS a processing routine creates an area of the field and substracts the weed spots (basically cuts holes in the area). The remaining area is then devided to square fields and those are processed to a Section file by a custom python script.

For a detailed explanaition see this [video](https://vimeo.com/645569057)

Details on the QGIS processing and the relevant scripts can be found [here](https://github.com/joschindlbeck/aog_qgis).

### AgOpenGPS processing

The created Sections file can than be imported in AgOpenGPS as usual and will result in a partly applied field where only the relevant spots are not yeat applied. With the AgOpenGPS section control enabled, only the weed spots will be applied.

A semantic segmentation U-Net like convnet trained on synthetic data for sugar beets crop/weeds detection.

## The dataset
The data used to train the model is a realistic synthetic dataset of *360x480* sugar beets crop/weeds images with corresponding annotations generated for **selective weeding** tasks (Accurately detect plants and distinguish them between crop and weeds) in agriculture robotics as having large agricultural datasets with pixel-level annotations is extremely time consuming.  
The dataset and the related work can be found [here](http://www.diag.uniroma1.it//~labrococo/fds/syntheticdatasets.html).
> Only **Synthetic SugarBeet Random Weeds** dataset is used for this task.

The original images are converted to grayscale, rescaled and cropped into 4 *256x256* patches.


## Model architecture
SugNet is U-shaped architecture that consists of a specific encoder-decoder scheme: The encoder reduces the spatial dimensions in every layer and increases the channels. On the other hand, the decoder increases the spatial dims while reducing the channels. In the end, the spatial dims are restored to make a prediction for each pixel in the input image.

- **Encoder (left side):**  
It consists of the repeated application of two 3x3 convolutions. Each conv is followed by a ReLU activation, batch normalization and a SAME 2x2 max pooling operation. Again, at each downsampling step, we double the number of feature channels, while we cut in half the spatial dimensions.

- **Decoder path (right side):**  
Every step in the expansive path consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2x2 transpose convolution, which halves the number of feature channels. We also have a concatenation with the corresponding feature map from the contracting path, and two 3x3 convolutional layers (each followed by ReLU + batch normalization). At the final layer, a 1x1 convolution is used to map the channels to the desired number of classes.

Improving the generalization error and transparency of regression models to estimate soil organic carbon using soil reflectance data. Ecological Informatics, 77. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102240

## Paper abstract

""Despite the success of using soil spectroscopy in studies to predict soil attributes, like soil organic carbon (SOC), recent work has revealed several limitations to this approach: a tendency for model overfitting and a lack of transparency of machine learning (ML) methods. Thus, we aimed to both test the ability to improve the generalizability of the models to predict SOC using a cross-validation (CV) strategy oriented to soil profiles and to test the gain in model interpretability by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method instead of the commonly used partial least squares (PLS) method. We used one soil spectral library composed of 127 soil profiles (n = 701), from Northeast Brazil, containing reflectance data from the visible, near, and short-wave infrared (VNIR) and the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral regions. We tuned the ML models to predict SOC via two CV strategies: the standard k-fold CV and the leave-soil-profile-out (LSPO) CV. We found that LSPO CV can produce models with better generalizability, as they lose less accuracy than the ones trained with k-fold CV. We conclude that disregarding the autocorrelation of SOC within the soil profile can produce models that are prone to overfitting. In addition, LASSO used 105 covariables from VNIR and 190 from MIR for a total of 8604 and 13,336 covariables, respectively. Moreover, a few LASSO covariables correlated with SOC and are associated with both electronic transitions and vibrational bonds in organic compounds, so the possibility and ease of identifying spectral bands and their correlation with organic carbon indicate that the LASSO models presented more transparent models than the PLS models.""

**A vérnyomásmérés pontatlan:** + 8Hgmm ha keresztbe teszed a lábad, +5Hgmm ha ülve méred. A kettő ösze is adódhat.

**vércukorszint mérése:**
- inzulint a langerhans szigetek termelnek, de ha a hasnyálmirigy tönkre megy akkor ez megszűnik
- ha a sejtek nem tudnak a vérből cukrot felvenni akkor a cukor a vérben marad => megnő a vércukorszint egy idő után ellenállnak a sejtek az inzulinnak.
- kémiai reakcióknál a vegyi anyagok szavatossága korlátos

## EKG
> non invazív szívvizsgáló eljárás mely a szív elektromos jelenségeit vizsgálja a szívizom összehúzódásakor keletkező elektromos feszültség mérésével
- szív elektromos jeleit vizsgálja 
- **az ekg műkédési elve:** a szívben lejátszódó elektromos folyamatok a test felszínén is jól érzékelhetőek 
- három pont egy szabályos háromszögeet ad ki, középpontban a szívvel, ennnek a három pontnak az egymáshoz viszonyítható feszültségéből megmondható az aktuális változások a szívben

EKG görbe: egy szabályos felvételen az öt csúcsot lehet megkülönböztetni:
- `P` -  ingerület a szinusz csomóban (a pitvaron áthaladó elektromos impulzust, a pitvar összehúzódását jelzi)
- `Q` -  az ingerület kezdete a kamrákban, ez az apró negatív csúcs gyakran nem is látható, ha nagyon megnövekszik, az infarktust jelezhet
- `R` -  a legnagyobb csúcs a kamrákon végigterjedő ingerületet mutatja 
- `S` -  ez a negatív csúcs a kamrán végigfutó ingerület végét jelzi

más elemk a diagrammon: 
-  `T` - a kamra repolarizációját mutatja 
-  `U` - a normális görbén nem vagy csak alig látható, kóros állapotokban, például káliumhiány esetén látványos
-  `PQ intervallum` - pitvar - kamrai átvezetést jelent

**normális szívverés:**
-  `P`-hullám
-  `QRS` komplexum
-  `T` hullám

## pacemakerek
> mellkasban vagy hasban műtét során elhelyezett  kis eszközök, ami elektromos impulzusok segítségével képes a szív ingerképző és ingerületvezető feladatait átvenni, kontrollálni
> 
> Aritmia esetén a szív vagy túl lassan (bradikardia), vagy túl gyorsan (tachikardia), vagy szabálytalanul veri a testbe a vért. Pacemaker beültetésével ezek a tünetek eltűnhetnek, a betegek teljes, aktív életet élhetnek.
> 
> *In 2013, multiple firms announced devices that could be inserted via a leg catheter rather than invasive surgery. The devices are roughly the size and shape of a pill, much smaller than the size of a traditional pacemaker. Once implanted, the device's prongs contact the muscle and stabilize heartbeats.* ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker#Intra-cardial

# Adatáramlás - DAQ
- végberendezés
  - adatgyűjtő 
  Vagy nagy fokon integrált rendszerek vagy nagy méreteket öltene, a hűtés, stb okán
  - nyers adatokat használ
  - adat töredékek kinyerhetőek
- köztes réted
  - Itt tároljuk a feldolgozott adatokat.


> Az állapotváltozásokból trenek alakíthatóak ki.
 
**Problémák:**
- sok adat, sok a redundáns adat is
- hibás és téves adatok
- nyílvánvaló adatok feldolgozása egyszerű, és a több szenzorjel közötti korreláció az érdekes
- az adat kereshető és nem túl redundáns tárolási módja
  statisztikák szerint: 
  - az adatok 78%-a felesleges
  - 22%-a dokumentált
  - 5%-a elemzett

A mintavételi frekvencia a maximális frekvenciától függ.

adatszűrés:
- zaj levétele
- jelek elkülönítése egymástól
- jel redundancia csökkentése
- adatforrás alapján:
  - szövegfájlból dolgozó
  - adatbázisbló dolgozó
  - bináris fájlból dolgozó
- hibareakció szerint:
  - hiba esetén leálló szűrő
  - automatikus javítást megkísérlő szűrő
  - hibás adatot eldobó/kihagyó
- optimizmus szerint:
  - pozitív szemléletű - adatok túlnyomórészt jók
  - negatív szemléletű - alapvetően azt mondják, hogy már hibás az érték, redundancia kell a rendszerbe, hogy csökkentsük a hibás méréseket
- jel karakterisztika szerint:
  - felületáteresztő: vágási pont *alatti*  értékektet kiszűri
  - aluláteresztő:  vágási pont *feletti* értékektet kiszűri
  - sáváteresztő: egy tartományon belüli értékeket neged át
  - lyukszűrő: egy sávban levő értétkeket *nem* enged át

> ## Adaptív szűrés folyamata:
> 
> - beérkező adatok összetettek
> - adaptáció = alkalmazkodás
> - szűrési paraméterek/tulajdonságok báltoztatásával a keletkező szűrtadat lényeges/fontos információkat nagyobb arányban tartlamazza
> 
> ## Előfeldolgozás:
> - simitás: ablakozunk, valamilyne ablak mérettel átlagokat hozunk, az adat mennyisége áltozatlan
> - aggregálás: sok adatból egy adatokt csinálunk, valhogy átlagolunk pl
> - küszöbözés: a lentésre fókuszálunk, nem az értékre, szinteket határozunk meg, amiket ha átlép az érték figyelembe vesszük
> - idősor analízis: a m.érés idejét és a mérést öszevetve használhatunk statisztikai eljárásokat, teát ha egy folytonos sorból kiveszünk valamilyen minta szerint adatokat akkor abból lehet valamilyen idő függvéányében jelezhető értéket megmondani
> 
> **független és összefüggő adatok:**
> - beteg közérzete mellé időjárás/hold ciklus/stb hozzárendelése

## rendszer távfelügyleet lépései
- SNMP
  - Az SNMP a Simple Network Management Protocol, azaz az egyszerű hálózat menedzsment protokoll rövidítése. A TCP/IP család része, az IETF hozta létre. Hálózatra kötött eszközök vezérlését, adatainak lekérdezését szolgálja.
  - *pl:*
    - *Nagios: alkalmas aktív hálózati eszközök, illetve szerverek monitorozására.* 
    - *HP OpenView: drága, már nem önlló termék.*
    - *Jopr: Vállalati szoftver menedzsment megoldás JBoss rendszerekhez.*
    - *RHQ: felxibilis plug-in rendszerű menedzsment szolgáltatás.*
- MIB-ek
  - Az SNMP protokollt kifejezetten bővíthetőre tervezték. Ezt a MIB-ek (management information base) segítségével érik el. 
  - Egy MIB bizonyos eszközök által használt speciális tulajdonságokat ír le.
  - Az egyes tulajdonságokat hierarchikus rendben elhelyezett objektumok reprezentálják. 
  - Az objektumoknak a hierarchiában való elhelyezkedése biztosít egyedi azonosítót.

## Overview

`MapFilter 2.0` is a free software for analyzing and removing inconsistent data in high density agricultural data sets (data from crop monitor, plant sensors, soil sensors). It is a simple software, with a friendly interface, whose objective is to help users to generate maps related to their cropping areas with greater reliability from the optimization of data quality. It performs the spatial filtering of these data through global and local analysis (isotropic and anisotropic) taking into account the neighborhood values. Visualization of data after filtering allows the user to make a quick analysis of the quality of spatial filtering.

## Install

To install the latest version of `MapFilter` download it from [link]( https://github.com/LeonardoAgricola/MapFilter2.0/releases/download/2.0/MapFilter.2.1.exe) and run the file:
```

OpenVRT is an open-source protocol for [Variable Rate Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Rate_Technology).

It consists of an embedded system like [Arduino](https://github.com/luizguilhermefr/OpenVRT-Firmware), controlled by a master like this App, controlling the input flow rate on the machine.

The App must be fed with a GeoJSON *prescription map*, that will have the application grid for the tillage.

### abstract
------------
Traditional ways of farming are no longer suitable for early and accurate detection of biotic stress. Recently, precision agriculture has been extensively used as a potential solution for agriculture problems using high resolution sensors and data analysis.
In this paper, several methods of machine learning have been utilized in order to study pests' population, and agricultural conditions for some crops such as potatoes, guava, and cotton, which are among the main Egyptian crops.

### Dataset and setup
The datasets used in this work for guava trees, cotton leafworm are a research study by Dr. Haitham Sharaf a professor at Cairo University, faculty of Agriculture, which contains data of weather conditions inside a controlled greenhouse system where Guava trees, cotton are planted.

Seasonal abundance of mealybug species and their associated predators and parasitoid on guava trees in Egypt have been surveyed. The survey has been conducted in Giza, Egypt spanning two years (Jan. 2014 to Dec. 2015). Fifteen plants have been randomly chosen and five leaves have been biweekly collected, Each leave has been picked either from the middle of the inspected trees or the four cardinal directions.The dataset includes `four pest mealybug species`, `four predator species`, `two parasitoids attack predators`, `four primary parasitoid species`, and `one hyper parasitoid`

The most dominant insect species are: `the mealybug Ferrisia virgata`, `the predator Scymnus syriacus`, `the parasitoid` that attacks  `Homalotylus vicinus`, `the primary parasitoid of mealybugs`, and `the hyperparasitoid`, `Chartocerus subaeneus.F.virgata` is the first recorded insect on guava trees in Egypt and the primary parasitoid Aenasius spieces is recorded for the first time in the Egyptian guava harvest. Based on the present study, it is clear that the surveyed natural enemies have played a weak role in controlling the mealybugs attacking guava trees, due to the effect of the parasitoids attacking predators and the hyperparasitoids. It is found that the role played by these bio-agents could have been of great importance in the process of predictive analysis and studying the relationship between these insects to accurately help reduce the harmful effect of insects or parasites that cannot be overcome by other insects.Consequently, in finding the correlation and statistical distribution between insects, some of which were among the most important factors for conducting a good predictive analysis.

### methods
Several methods of machine learning have been utilized for these analyses such as support vector machines ,Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting algorithms for classification (supervised learning); k-means and self-organizing maps for clustering (unsupervised learning). These methods are able to calculate both linear and non-linear models, require few statistical assumptions and adapt flexibly to a wide range of data characteristics.
The collected dataset includes the insects popularity on a biweekly basis, meanwhile the weather data is available on a daily basis. Thus some preprocessing on the data has to be done to make use of the available daily weather data.Here, unsupervised learning techniques played the solution to predict the relationship between climatic and soil features and population of insects.
Mainly two methods have been used: predicting the numbers of each insect separately on a daily basis, and predicting the numbers of all insects simultaneously together on a daily basis as well. In each of these methods one or a combination of the following techniques have been applied: `linear interpolation`, `data imputation` using `mean/median value`, data imputation using `KNN` , `k-fold cross-validation`, `standard scaler`, and `min-max scaler`

This repository provides the source code for ""Improved Weed Segmentation in UAV Imagery of Sorghum Fields with a Combined Deblurring Segmentation Model"".
In this study, we present a novel deep-learning based model for weed segmentation in UAV images called `DeBlurWeedSeg`. This model is a combination of a deblurring and segmentation model (see Figure 1b bottom). Our experiments show that a typical weed segmentation model (Figure b top) cannot segment weeds from crop and background in motion blurred images at test time and our model is able to deal with sharp and motion blurred images without fine-tuning.

## Results on the hold-out test-set
Results of WeedSeg compared to DeBlurWeedSeg.

|                Model | Sorensen-Dice-Coefficient | 
|---------------------:|--------------------------:|
| WeedSeg (scenario 1) |                    0.7327 |
| WeedSeg (scenario 2) |                    0.7381 |
|        DeBlurWeedSeg |                    0.8373 |

The confusion matrix shows per-class accuracies for Background (BG), Sorghum (S) and Weed (W). Here we can clearly see a drop in performance for weed and sorghum in motion blurred image patches. Our proposed model is able to perform similarly well on sharp and deblurred image patches.

## Reproduce Results
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the data and the model from mendeley data using the link https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/k4gvsjv4t3/1.
3. Extract and move the content of the data folder in `data`. Move the model called `model.h5` into `models`.
4. Install the DeBlurring Model NAFNet (see next Section)
5. Generate the results on the hold-out test-set
```bash
python3 generate_results.py
```
This script will generate the quantitative results shown in the results section of our paper. 
6. Generate results of the deblurring model
```bash
python3 evaluate_deblurring.py
```

## Install the deblurring model NAFNet
First, clone the NAFNet package from https://github.com/megvii-research/NAFNet and follow the installation steps
Additionally, we install the package `cog`:
```bash
pip install cog
```
Then download the weights of ""NAFNet-REDS-width64.pth"" into `.NAFNet/experiments/pretrained_models/`
This can be done from `https://github.com/megvii-research/NAFNet/#results-and-pre-trained-models`

## Explanation of the data structure
We made our dataset publicly available on Mendeley data in the file `data.zip`. 
After extracting this file, there will be 3 subfolders. 
- `gt`: 1300 matching sharp and blurry image-pairs and their semantic segmentation masks. This folder contains the whole dataset. One example image is shown in Figure 4a, where only the sharp patches are used for training. The blurry counter-part is saved for reference only.
- `gt_testset` 100 patches of the hold-out test-set that were used to evaluate the main findings of our research. The structure is similar to the patches in the `gt` folder, but with additional deblurred versions and their corresponding semantic segmentations. For the sharp image patches that were deblurred, we used the same semantic masks as for the sharp patches, as there was little difference after the deblurring step. After deblurring the blurry patches, the image content changed to a large extent, therefore we needed to re-label these patches for a fair comparison. In the files, we show the deblurred images only for reference reasons, as they are generated by the `DeBlurWeedSeg` model internally.  
- `splits`: 3 csv files for the dataset split. Used for training, validating and testing our models.

## Reproduce the hyperparameter optimisation results
1. Data Split
```bash
python3 split_data.py
```
This script will ensure a stratified split based on the number and type of plants present in a patch.

2. Hyperparameter Optimisation
Change the encoder name and possible batch sizes in the following script accordingly. CSV files with metrics of the run will be saved in the `logs` directory.
```bash
python3 hyperparameter_optimisation.py
```
We provide a summary of the hyperparameter optimisation trials from this study in `results/all_hp_results.csv`.

3. Re-train on the full training + validation split and save the final model for predictions.
```bash
python3 retrain.py --encoder_name resnet50 --max_steps 2960 --batch_size 128 --learning_rate 0.0005395030966670228
```
The values correspond to the best hyperparameter set of our study.

A simple console app which will take a bitmaps for spectral band 3 and band 4 and generate a Normalized Difference Vegitation Index (NDVI) image.

More Information on the NDVI can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Difference_Vegetation_Index).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository using the following command.

    git clone https://github.com/WaywardHayward/ndvi-generator.git

Run to code using the following command.

    cd ndvi-generator
    dotnet restore
    dotnet run

The application will then prompt you for a red and a nir bitmap.
Once the application is completed, you will see the NDVI image in same directory as the red image.

The colouring of the NDVI image is based on the following formula:

    NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)

This is then converted to an RGB image using with Red representing a low NDVI value and Green representing a high NDVI value.

## What is the Mission Manager?

As described in [Deliverable 2.3 - Architecture Requirements and Definition](http://www.afarcloud.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/D2.3-Architecture-Requirements-and-Definition-2.0_VFINAL.pdf), the mission manager is:

> [...] the component manages all operations and data flows in which vehicles (i.e., GVs, UAVs) are
involved. The main duties of this component are related to the delivery of the mission plan defined by the Farm Management System, as well as receiving the information from the vehicles that participate
in the mission according to its progress.
>
> Also, this component is responsible for sending events to elements in the Hardware Layer. We will
consider as events all relevant data (e.g., command to abort a mission) sent by the middleware that
should be considered by vehicles or other IoT devices. Events will be generated by the Farm
Management System as a result of an analysis of data

In particular, this component is able to:

- Receive a request for the initial status of the vehicles (System Configurator) through a dedicated REST interface.
- Receive a full mission from the MMT through a thrift interface.
- Parse the received mission and:
  - Generate the vehicle plan for each autonomous vehicle participating in the mission, and publishing it to the MQTT broker.
  - Generate the JSON representation of the prescription map for ***one*** tractor participating in the mission, and sending it to the ISOBUS Converter.
- Receive the abort events for both vehicles and mission, and publishing it to the MQTT broker.

## How to generate the Mission Manager bundle
Use `mvn install` from the Mission Manager project folder (the one with the `pom.xml` file). This will generate a file named `MissionManager-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` inside the `target` folder.

## How to configure the Mission Manager
At this stage the Mission Manager have some properties that define its behavior, and that can be configured. These properties are:

- `thrift.port` defines the port for the thrift service provided.
- `thrift.style` defines the type of thrift service style used. By default it use *multiplex*.
- `rest.port` defines the port for the REST services provided. This includes the REST service for the System Configurator, as well as some other REST services for monitoring and configuring the Mission Manager while it is running.
- `rest.base_uri` defines the base uri for the REST services provided.
- `mmt.ip` defines the address of the MMT.
- `mmt.port` defines the port of the MMT thrift service.
- `mmt.enabled_notifications` defines if the Mission Manager is enabled or disabled to send notifications to the MMT.
- `mqtt.protocol` defines the protocol used by the MQTT broker. By default it is set to *ssl*.
- `mqtt.server` defines the server address for the MQTT broker.
- `mqtt.port` defines the port for the MQTT broker.
- `mqtt.user` defines the username for accessing to the MQTT broker.
- `mqtt.pass` defines the password for accessing to the MQTT broker.
- `mqtt.client_id` defines the client id for accessing to the MQTT broker. By default is set to _AFC Mission Manager._
- `mqtt.topic.mission` defines the schema for the topic levels related to a mission.
- `mqtt.topic.system_configuration` defines the schema for the topic levels related to the system configuration.
- `mqtt.retained.mission`defines the retained property for the MQTT related to missions.
- `mqtt.retained.system_configuration` defines the retained property for the MQTT related to system configuration.
- `sc.request.timeout` defines the timeout for the status vector request from the System Configuration.
- `sc.max_vehicles` defines the maximum number of vehicles that can reply to a status vector request from the System Configuration. ***Only for test purposes***.
- `dq.server` defines the server address for the Data Query component.
- `dq.port` defines the port for the Data Query component.
- `isobusconverter.server` defines the server address for the ISOBUS Converter component.
- `isobusconverter.port` defines the port for the ISOBUS Converter component.
- `last_sequence_number` defines the las used sequence number for messages published to the MQTT.
- `debug` defines the logging of debug information.

### Configuration before running the Mission Manager
To configure the Mission Manager before running the Mission Manager, create a file named `local.properties` in the same folder where the `.jar` is, and add the configuration properties you need.

### Configuration during the execution of the Mission Manager
To check the current configuration being used by the Mission Manager, go to **http://*server_address*:*rest.port*/*rest.base_uri*/MissionManager/conf**, where:

- *server* is the address where the Mission Manager is running.
- *rest.port* is the port the Mission Manager is using for REST services, set by the property with the same name.
- *rest.base_uri* is the base URI for the REST services run by the Mission Manager, set by the property with the same name.

To change any configuration property, make a **PUT** request to the same address as before (**http://*server_address*:*rest.port*/*rest.base_uri*/MissionManager/conf**), with those properties that need to be changed sent as `application/x-url-form-encoded` with their new value.

***NOTE:*** Every change made during the execution of the Mission Manager is made permanent, and stored in a configuration file called `stored.properties`. This file can be modified and/or removed if required. The priority of the configurations is as follows: if a property has a stored value in `stored.properties`, that value is used. If a property does not have a stored value, but it is defined as in `local.properties`, then that value is used. If a property does not have neither a stored value, nor a local value, then the default value is used.

***NOTE:*** There are some properties that cannot be changed while running the Mission Manager:

- `rest.port`
- `rest.base_uri`

## How to run the Mission Manager
The Mission Manager is implemented to be run as a standalone application inside a Docker container. Therefore, for testing purposes it can also be run as a standalone application without Docker.

### How to run the Mission Manager as a standalone application
The Mission Manager requires Java JRE 8 or higher. To run the Mission Manager, execute `java -jar MissionManager-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

A valid `mqttTrustStore.jks` file is required in the same folder as the Mission Manager in order to access to the MQTT Broker.

### How to run the Mission Manager as a Docker container
To create a docker image, it is recommended to use the `openjdk:12-jdk-alpine` as the base image, as it is enough of running the Mission Manager, and has a small size compared to the openjdk image using Debian.

The use of `openjdk:12-jdk-alpine` also provides with two interesting advantages over 8 to 11 JDK Alpine versions:

- It allows to enable a memory and CPU restriction for the execution of the container. This is available from version 9. Version 8 officially supports it, but it can be buggy.
- It includes the Java Mission Control that allows to monitor and record the performance of the Mission Manager using the Java Flight Recorder tool (only available directly from version 12).

The example *Dockerfile* used for running the AFC Mission Manager for the different scenarios is as follows, using a different local `local.properties` file for each scenario:

```
# Base Alpine Linux based image with OpenJDK JRE only
FROM openjdk:12-jdk-alpine
# Install bash
RUN apk add --no-cache bash
# copy application JAR
COPY MissionManager-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar /usr/app/MissionManager.jar
COPY mqttTrustStore.jks /usr/app/mqttTrustStore.jks
COPY local.properties /usr/app/local.properties
WORKDIR /usr/app
# specify default command
CMD [""java"", ""-jar"", ""MissionManager.jar""]
```

Save the previous *Dockerfile* example and modify it according to each specific case.

To build the Docker image, execute `docker build -f Dockerfile -t mman:latest`

Once the Docker image is created, it can be run executing `docker run -d --name mman-test -p extThriftPort:portThrift -p extRESTPort:portREST -m 512m`, where _portThrift_ and _portRest_ are the ports for the Thrift and REST services used by the Mission Manager within the container, and _extThriftPort_ and _extRESTPort_ are their corresponding published ports in the host machine.

Please, be aware that by default the timezone applied to an Alpine based image uses UTC by default. Change it to your needs accordingly.

## Monitoring the Mission Manager

### Logs
The logs for the Mission Manager can be accessed via REST through **http://*server_address*:*rest.port*/*rest.base_uri*/MissionManager/logs/MissionManager.log**.

### Mission related files
The mission received from the MMT, as well as the generated files from it can be accessed through **http://*server_address*:*rest.port*/*rest.base_uri*/MissionManager/missions**. The missions are stored in separate folders per day (for v1.0.0-rc5). For each mission, there should be the following files:

- **AFC-Mission-*date*-*hour*-*missionID*-*requestId*.ser**: This is the mission file as received from the MMT, stored as a serialized object.
- **AFC-Mission-*date*-*hour*-*missionID*-*requestId*.json**: This is the mission file received from the MMT represented in JSON format. *NOTE:* NaN values are changed to Double.MAX_VALUE, as JSON has no representation to NaN.
- **AFC-CSV-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-commands.csv**: Parsed commands from the received mission.
- **AFC-CSV-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-forbidenArea.csv**: Parsed forbiddenArea from the received mission.
- **AFC-CSV-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-homeLocation.csv**: Parsed homeLocation from the received mission.
- **AFC-CSV-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-navigationArea.csv**: Parsed navigationArea from the received mission.
- **AFC-CSV-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-tasks.csv**: Parsed tasks from the received mission.
- **AFC-CSV-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-vehicles.csv**: Parsed vehicles from the received mission.
- **AFC-VP-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-*vehicleId*.json**: Parsed vehicle plan for *vehicleId* from the received mission. This is the same content published to the MQTT Broker.
- **AFC-PM-*date*-*hour*-*requestId*-*missionId*-*vehicleId*.json**: Parsed prescription map for *vehicleId* from the received mission. This is the same content sent to the ISOBUS Converter.
- **AFC-PM-*date*-*hour*.xml**: Generated prescription map received from the ISOBUS Converter.

India is considered as a major agricultural powerhouse as this sector counts to about 15% of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, Indian agriculture still lacks access to modern farming techniques, which results in the wastage of resources. One of the modern technologies used to bridge this technological gap is an user-friendly messaging application known as Chatbot. A chatbot trained with agriculture related data can assist the farmers in having knowledge about the modern farming practices without the hassle of waiting for an expert to help solve their queries. 

In this context, a natural language based chatbot model is proposed here, named KisaanBot, as a remote assistant to the farmer, which can respond to their queries. Our assistant is trained by the RASA Open Source Framework and can be accessed with a Web URL via Dialogflow deployment. The proposed chatbot model identifies the intent and the entity from user utterances and it generates the responses from the trained database, which delivers it to the user. The knowledge base used in training is designed by collecting grouped data from Kisan Call Centre (KCC) and Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). This knowledge base comprises the frequently asked questions and the corresponding answers regarding agricultural practices of West Bengal concerned with four domains namely soil, weather, crops and fertigation. Hence, the dataset comprises three fields, such as intent (the goal of a user query), query (the question related to that intent) and the answer (response from the chatbot). The chatbot is trained with 9 subqueries for each query to develop the knowledge base having 9 queries for a single intent. This can resolve the issue which arises due to different ways of framing a particular question by the users. The proposed system is pretrained and tested in the 80:20 ratio with the dataset. The efficiency of the proposed model is assessed by the performance measures, such as precision, recall and f1-score. The overall accuracy thus achieved by the proposed model is  99.82% which shows an improvement over existing works.

The emergence of Deep Neural Networks has allowed the development of fully automated and efficient diagnostic systems for plant disease and pest phenotyping. Although previous approaches have proven to be promising, they are limited, especially in real-life scenarios, to properly diagnose and characterize the problem. In this work, we propose a framework which besides recognizing and localizing various plant abnormalities also informs the user about the severity of the diseases infecting the plant. By taking a single image as input our algorithm is able to generate detailed descriptive phrases (user-defined) that displays the location, severity stage and visual attributes of all the abnormalities that are present in the image. Our framework is comprised of three main components. One of them is a detector that accurately and efficiently recognizes and localizes the abnormalities in plants by extracting region-based anomaly features using a deep neural network based feature extractor. The second one is an encoder-decoder network that performs pixel-level analysis to generate abnormality specific severity levels. Lastly, an integration unit which aggregates the information of these units and assigns unique IDs to all the detected anomaly instances. Thus, generating descriptive sentences describing location, severity and class of anomalies infecting plants. We discuss two possible ways of utilizing the above-mentioned units in a single framework. We evaluate and analyze the efficacy of both approaches on newly constructed diverse paprika disease and pest recognition dataset, comprising six anomaly categories along with eleven different severity levels. Our algorithm achieves mean average precision of 91.7% for abnormality detection task and mean panoptic quality score of 70.78% for severity level prediction. Our algorithm provides practical and cost-efficient solution to farmers that facilitates proper handling of crops.

Embracing limited and imperfect datasets in plant disease recognition using deep learning.

Currently maintained by [Mingle Xu](https://xml94.github.io/ ""Personal website"").

# Motivation
>Recent advancements in deep learning have brought significant improvements to plant disease recognition.
However, achieving satisfactory performance often requires high-quality training datasets, 
which are challenging and expensive to collect. 
Consequently, the practical application of current deep learning-based methods in real-world scenarios 
is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality datasets.
Consequently, we argue that embracing non-high-quality datasets is more convincing and practical.
Although this embrace brings opportunities, new challenges exist.
A taxonomy of related challenges is, therefore, proposed to enrich our understandings.
With this perspective, we do hope that deep learning can be implemented 
in real-world applications with satisfactory performance.


# Taxonomy of the challenges

* Limited data: the training dataset is not in large-scale.
* * Class-level: consider the variation of different classes within the training dataset.
* * * ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Few--shot-ffe8d1): All classes have similar few annotated images, where trained models may get low performance for all classes.
* * * ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Class%20imbalance-ffd7e1): One class has many more annotated images than another class, where trained models may get high performance in the former class but suffer in the latter class.
* * Dataset-level: consider the diversity between the training and test datasets.
* * * ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Domain%20shift-red): The training and test datasets share the same label spaces but are in different distribution spaces, where trained models may get low test performance.
* * * ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Unknown%20class-purple): Unknown (new) classes exist in the test dataset, where trained models will consider the corresponding image into a known class and not distinguish the unknown from known classes.
* Imperfect data: the training dataset is annotated in an undesired way.
* * ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Incomplete%20annotation-green): Training datasets have labeled and unlabeled images simultaneously, where utilizing the unlabeled images may contribute to the test performance.
* * ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Inexact%20annotation-yellow): Training datasets are given with only coarse-grained annotations, where utilizing these annotations is challenging to train models.
* * ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Inaccurate%20annotation-blue): Some annotations may be inaccurate, where it is challenging to get decent test performance by utilizing these annotations to train models.

## Synopsis

This project contains *Python* code for *Two Source Energy Balance* models (Priestley-Taylor **TSEB-PT**, 
Dual Time Difference **DTD** and TSEB with component soil and canopy temperatures **TSEB-2T**) 
for estimating sensible and latent heat flux (evapotranspiration) based on measurements of radiometric surface temperature. 

The project consists of: 

1. lower-level modules with the basic functions needed in any resistance energy balance model 

2. higher-level scripts for easily running TSEB with tabulated data and/or satellite/airborne imagery.

## Installation

Download the project to your local system, enter the download directory and then type

`python setup.py install` 

if you want to install pyTSEB and its low-level modules in your Python distribution. 

The following Python libraries will be required:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- pyPro4Sail, at [https://github.com/hectornieto/pyPro4Sail]
- GDAL, for running TSEB over an image
- pandas
- netCDF4
- bokeh

With `conda`, you can create a complete environment with
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Code Example
### High-level example

The easiest way to get a feeling of TSEB and its configuration is through the provided ipython/jupyter notebooks. 
In a terminal shell, navigate to your working folder and type

- `jupyter notebook ProcessPointTimeSeries.ipynb` 
>for configuring and running TSEB over a time series of tabulated data

- `jupyter notebook ProcessLocalImage.ipynb` 
>for configuring and running TSEB over an image/scene using local meteorological data

In addition, you can also run TSEB with the scripts *TSEB_local_image_main.py* and *TSEB_point_time_series_main.py*, 
which will read an input configuration file (defaults are *Config_LocalImage.txt* and *Config_PointTimeSeries.txt* respectively). 
You can edit these configuration files or make a copy to fit your data and site characteristics and either run any of 
these two scripts in a Python GUI or in a terminal shell:

- `python TSEB_local_image_main.py <configuration file>`
> where \<configuration file> points to a customized configuration file... leave it blank if you want to use the default 
file *Config_LocalImage.txt*

- `python TSEB_point_time_series.py <configuration file>`
> where \<configuration file> points to a customized configuration file... leave it blank if you want to use the default 
file *Config_PointTimeSeries.txt*

### Low-level example
You can run any TSEB model or any related process in python by importing the module *TSEB* from the *pyTSEB* package. 
It will also import the ancillary modules (*resitances.py* as `res`, *netRadiation* as `rad`,
*MOsimilarity.py* as `MO`, *ClumpingIndex.py* as `CI` and *meteoUtils.py* as `met`)

```python
import pyTSEB.TSEB as TSEB 
output=TSEB.TSEB_PT(Tr_K, vza, Ta_K, u, ea, p, Sdn_dir, Sdn_dif, fvis, fnir, sza, Lsky, LAI, hc, emisVeg, emisGrd, spectraVeg, spectraGrd, z_0M, d_0, zu, zt)
```

You can type
`help(TSEB.TSEB_PT)`
to understand better the inputs needed and the outputs returned

The direct and difuse shortwave radiation (`Sdn_dir`, `Sdn_dif`, `fvis`, `fnir`) and the downwelling longwave radiation (`Lsky`) can be estimated by

```python
emisAtm = TSEB.rad.calc_emiss_atm(ea,Ta_K_1) # Estimate atmospheric emissivity from vapour pressure (mb) and air Temperature (K)
Lsky = emisAtm * TSEB.met.calc_stephan_boltzmann(Ta_K_1) # in W m-2
difvis,difnir, fvis,fnir=TSEB.rad.calc_difuse_ratio(Sdn,sza,press=p, Wv=1) # fraction of difuse and PAR/NIR radiation from shortwave irradiance (W m-2, solar zenith angle, atmospheric pressure and precipitable water vapour )
Skyl=difvis*fvis+difnir*fnir # broadband difuse fraction
Sdn_dir=Sdn*(1.0-Skyl)
Sdn_dif=Sdn*Skyl
```

- First week: <br> 
The first week was the introduction to embedded systems by getting acquainted with the STM32 boards on which the whole project was based. This week's activities were divided into two parts: in the first part of the day before the break there were several presentations that would help us to make the main project we chose in the second week, and in the second part we tried and saw the application of the previously presented material. <br> 
I worked with the STM32L100C board in the first week. I learned solidly how to use Atollic TrueSTUDIO, STM32CubeMX and TouchGFX, which I initially had difficulty with.
I also had the opportunity during the whole internship to keep my board and try to learn additional things after the working day. <br> 
At the end of the first week we had project proposals from the mentor and we could think for a few days on what topic we would like to work on.


- Second week: <br> 
At the beginning of the second week we divided into groups and chose topics. I was working with another colleague on a team on ""Automated Smart Irrigation System"".
We first made the project on the STM32L100C board, but since this board did not have a built-in screen we switched to the STM32f769i Discovery in order for the final 
presentation to be better. In the main program I enabled to read the values ​​given by the sensor and I also performed the mapping of the same.  <br> 
We set a condition for soil moisture in order to prevent the plants from drying out, and we prevented that with a special pump that irrigated the 
soil if the condition is met, ie the humidity is lower than we want. Since every plant needs a different level of soil moisture, we set an interrupt which, 
by clicking on the button that is built into the plate, increases the limit by 5% until we reach 100% and then returns to the initial set value.


- Third week: <br> 
In the third week we made a display of the change in humidity on the screen from the board itself in the form of a graph that when it reached the end of 
the screen we took the second part of the values and put them at the beginning so that the measurements could continue and be seen. part of the previous ones. <br> 
During this week we have created special conditions with which appropriate messages appear on the screen. For example a message if the sensor is not in the 
ground or the sensor is not well connected and so on.


- Fourth week: <br> 
Last week we tested the project and saw what little things we could add to make it look better (such as changing the colors on the screen).  <br> 
Once we were sure that everything was working as we wanted we had to make a presentation of what we had made.

# Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology (aqp) package for R

<a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/aqp/master/misc/hexstickers/aqp_sticker_v2.png"">
<img src = ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/aqp/master/misc/hexstickers/aqp_sticker_v2.png"" alt = ""aqp hexsticker (Paxton, Montauk, Woodbridge, Ridgebury, Whitman, Catden soil series dendogram)"" title = ""aqp hexsticker (Paxton, Montauk, Woodbridge, Ridgebury, Whitman, Catden soil series dendogram)"" width = ""45%"" height = ""45%"" hspace=""15"" vspace=""15"" align=""right""/></a>

The Algorithms for Quantitative Pedology (AQP) project was started in
2009 to organize a loosely-related set of concepts and source code on
the topic of soil profile visualization, aggregation, and classification
into this package (aqp). Over the past 8 years, the project has grown
into a suite of related R packages that enhance and simplify the
quantitative analysis of soil profile data. Central to the AQP project
is a new vocabulary of specialized functions and data structures that
can accommodate the inherent complexity of soil profile information;
freeing the scientist to focus on ideas rather than boilerplate data
processing tasks <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2012.10.020>. These functions and
data structures have been extensively tested and documented, applied to
projects involving hundreds of thousands of soil profiles, and deeply
integrated into widely used tools such as SoilWeb
<https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/soilweb-apps/>. Components of
the AQP project (aqp, soilDB, sharpshootR, soilReports packages) serve
an important role in routine data analysis within the USDA-NRCS Soil
Science Division. The AQP suite of R packages offer a convenient
platform for bridging the gap between pedometric theory and practice.

# Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

Crop recommendation is one of the most important aspects of precision agriculture. Crop recommendations are based on a number of factors. Precision agriculture seeks to define these criteria on a site-by-site basis in order to address crop selection issues. While the ""site-specific"" methodology has improved performance, there is still a need to monitor the systems' outcomes.Precision agriculture systems aren't all created equal. However, in agriculture, it is critical that the recommendations made are correct and precise, as errors can result in significant material and capital loss.

This application will assist farmers in increasing agricultural productivity, preventing soil degradation in cultivated land, reducing chemical use in crop production, and maximizing water resource efficiency.

The farm monitoring system is a mixture of hardware and software additives. The hardware part includes embedded systems and software program is the Arduino ide.The Arduino ide displays readings from sensors are inserted using the hardware.The special sensors used are temperature and humidity sensor,pir sensor and soil moisture 
sensor. The facts gathered with the aid of the sensors is sent to the Arduino UNO microcontroller ATmega328.The gathered information may be displayed in a Arduino IDE. A GSM module is hooked up with the Arduino to facilitate messaging service which updates the farmers each 10 seconds approximately the climate conditions of the subject.
IV.HARDWARE USED
This project is aided with many hardwares. This proposed technology is an amalgamation of different sensors, microcontroller and communication medium to help the farmers to work on their farms.

A.Arduino uno

Arduino is a microcontroller to control the working of the sensors and manage the working of the device. The Uno version of Arduino is implemented in this project. It was developed by Arduino CC. The Arduino board comes with various number of pins. The pins are categorized as output and input pins. The input pins ac cepts digital as well as analog pins. It has 14 digital pins and 
6 analog pins. It accepts 7 to 20 volts of power for working. It also has an USB port. The Uno was the first version of Arduino to be introduced in the Arduino family. 

B.DHT11 Temperature And Humidity Sensor

The DHT11 Temperature And Humidity sensor is used to sense temperature and humidity present in the atmosphere. It has 3 pins generally. One pin is used for transmitting signals, the next pin is used to receive signals and the last pin is data transfer. It can be used for prolonged time period. It gives approximate results. It regularly sends information to Arduino Uno. The information
consists the signals which contain the values gathered about temperature and humidity. It is reliable on nature. It gives a very fast response. 

C.Soil Moisture sensor

The Soil Moisture sensor is used to sense moisture content in the soil. It checks the volume of water content or moisture present in the soil. The calculations are done in the soil moisture sensor through coefficients. It estimates the volume of water content in the soil. It detects the water content in the soil and gets and sends the analog signals which is shown digitally. It transmits
the the signals containing information or data or values of the condition of soil to Arduino to futher process it and display.

D.PIR Sensor

PIR sensor stands for Passive Infrared Sensor. It detects the movement around it and sends the signals accordingly. It radiates electromagnetic radiation. It hits the object and comes back to the PIR sensor telling that there is presence of an object in a specified range. An led or Buzzer can be attached with PIR sensor so that the hindrance can be detected easily. It will help the farmer to know if any animal has broken into field and is destroying  crops. In this way the farmer can save his crops.

E.GSM Shield
The GSM Shield is used as a method of communication in this proposed technology. The GSM Shield is sed to send text messages to the farmer’s cell phone about the conditions of the temperature, humidity soil and field area. A separate coding has to be done for gsm shield in Arduino. It needs a sim to implement it. The number of the sim has to be fed in the coding. The number would belong to
farmer to which the messages has to be sent. The values detected and transmitted by the sensors to Arduino is sent by the gsm to the cell phone. Hence it uses a network which does not require internet and overcpmes the biggest loop hole of projects of this domain. 
It can also be used to make voice calls. It is bas3d on radio modem M10 Quectel. It incorporates AT Commands. It also has several pins to connect to. It uses TCP and UDP protocol for sending data packets. It uses HTTP which is HyperText Transfer Protocol.


The Farm Monitoring System can be used for destiny factors of agriculture. This would be a relief for farmers since it decreases the load of manual efforts A gadget to      screen moisture levels within the soil changed into constructed and the assignment furnished an possibility to take a look at        the prevailing structures, at the side of their features anddownsides. The stated gadget 
may be used to turn on/off the water sprinkler in keeping with soil moisture levels thereby automating the technique of 
irrigation that is one of the most time ingesting activities in farming. Agriculture is one of the most effort-consuming hobby.     The device makes use of statistics from soil moisture sensors to irrigate soil FUTURE SCOPE
The proposed assignment may be further greater with the aid of including pump to  the       machine to facilitate computerized irrigation. The automated irrigation  device may be triggered when the moisture      content of the soil is going under the brink       stage.  The threshold degree can be decided    in the code written for Arduino. So whenever the fee for moisture goes under the brink
degree, the pump gets mechanically on and       irrigation is performed to an ok  degree.To improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the machine, the noted recommendations can be placed into attention. Alternative of controlling the water pump may be given to the farmer by way of which they are able to turn on or off the pump to be able to start or prevent the manner of irrigation without being there on     farm at that gift time. The farmer can know   earlier about the negative climate situations. In such 
instances farmer might also want to    forestall the machine remotely or routinely. The concept of the usage of IOT for 
irrigation can be prolonged in addition to  other tasks in farming together with farm   animals management, fireplace detection and climate manage.This could limit human intervention in   farming sports.

<!-- badges: end -->

Rosetta is a neural network-based model for predicting unsaturated soil
hydraulic parameters from basic soil characterization data. The model
predicts parameters for the van Genuchten unsaturated soil hydraulic
properties model, using sand, silt, and clay, bulk density and water
content.

{rosettaPTF} uses {reticulate} to wrap the Python
[rosetta-soil](https://github.com/usda-ars-ussl/rosetta-soil) module:
providing several versions of the
[Rosetta](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/ROSETTA-API.html)
pedotransfer functions in an R environment.

This package is primarily intended for more demanding use cases (such as
calling Rosetta “continuously” on each cell in a stack of rasters), or
for accessing the uncertainty and shape metrics from Zhang & Schaap
(2017). High-throughput input to the pedotransfer function is possible
by using RasterStack ([raster](https://github.com/rspatial/raster/)) or
SpatRaster ([terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra/)) objects as
input.

## Install {rosettaPTF}

First, install the package from GitHub:

``` r
if (!require(""remotes"")) install.packages(""remotes"")
remotes::install_github(""ncss-tech/rosettaPTF"")
```

Then load the `rosetta-soil` module by loading the R package. If you do
not have an available `python` installation or `rosetta-soil` module you
will be notified.

``` r
library(rosettaPTF)
```

### `rosetta-soil` Python module

The [rosetta-soil](https://github.com/usda-ars-ussl/rosetta-soil) module
is a Python package maintained by Dr. Todd Skaggs (USDA-ARS) and other
U.S. Department of Agriculture employees.

The Rosetta pedotransfer function predicts five parameters for the van
Genuchten model of unsaturated soil hydraulic properties

- `theta_r` : residual volumetric water content
- `theta_s` : saturated volumetric water content
- `log10(alpha)` : retention shape parameter `[log10(1/cm)]`
- `log10(n)` : retention shape parameter (also referred to as `npar`)
- `log10(ksat)` : saturated hydraulic conductivity `[log10(cm/d)]`

For each set of input data a mean and standard deviation of each
parameter is given.

Less demanding use cases are encouraged to use the web interface or API
endpoint. There are additional wrappers of the API endpoints provided by
the soilDB R package `ROSETTA()` method. For small amounts of data
consider using the interactive version that has copy/paste
functionality: <https://www.handbook60.org/rosetta>.

# Input Data

The [Rosetta](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/ROSETTA-API.html)
model relies on a minimum of 3 soil properties, with increasing
(expected) accuracy as additional properties are included:

- Required, `sand`, `silt`, `clay`: USDA soil texture separates
  (percentages) that sum to 100%

- Optional, `bulk density (any moisture basis)`: mass per volume after
  accounting for \>2mm fragments, units of grams/cm3

- Optional, `volumetric water content at 33 kPa`: roughly “field
  capacity” for most soils, units of cm3/cm3

- Optional, `volumetric water content at 1500 kPa`: roughly “permanent
  wilting point” for most plants, units of cm3/cm3

The default order of inputs is: `sand`, `silt`, `clay`,
`bulk density (any basis)`, `water content (field capacity; 33 kPa)`,
`water content (permanent wilting point; 1500 kPa)` of which the first
three are required.

If you specify field capacity water content, you must specify bulk
density. If you specify permanent wilting point water content you must
also specify bulk density and field capacity water content.

## {reticulate} Setup

If you are using this package for the first time you will need to have
Python installed and you will need to download the necessary modules.

You can set up {reticulate} to install modules into a virtual or Conda
environment. {reticulate} offers `reticulate::install_python()` and
`reticulate::install_miniconda()` to download and set up Python/Conda if
you have not yet done so.

### Finding the `python` binaries

``` r
rosettaPTF::find_python()
#> [1] ""C:/Users/Andrew/Documents/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/Scripts/python.exe""
```

`find_python()` provides heuristics for setting up {reticulate} to use
Python in commonly installed locations.

The first attempt makes use of `Sys.which()` to find installations
available in the user path directory.

`find_python()` also provides an option for using ArcGIS Pro Conda
environments–which may be needed for users who cannot install Conda by
some other means. To use this option specify the `arcpy_path` argument
or the `rosettaPTF.arcpy_path` option to locate both the ArcGIS Pro
Conda environment and Python binaries in *C:/Program
Files/ArcGIS/Pro/bin/Python*, for example:

``` r
rosettaPTF::find_python(arcpy_path = ""C:/Program Files/ArcGIS/Pro/bin/Python"")
```

If automatic configuration via `find_python()` fails (returns `NULL`)
you can manually set a path to the `python` executable with the
{reticulate} `RETICULATE_PYTHON` environment variable:
`Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = ""path/to/python"")` or
`reticulate::use_python(""path/to/python"")`

### Install `rosetta-soil` Python Module

The {rosettaPTF} `install_rosetta()` method wraps
`reticulate::py_install(""rosetta-soil"")`.

You can use `install_rosetta()` to install into custom environments by
specifying `envname` as needed. After installing a new version of the
module you should restart your R session.

``` r
rosettaPTF::install_rosetta()
#> Using virtual environment ""C:/Users/Andrew/Documents/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate"" ...
#> + ""C:/Users/Andrew/Documents/.virtualenvs/r-reticulate/Scripts/python.exe"" -m pip install --upgrade --no-user ""rosetta-soil""
#> [1] TRUE
```

Alternately, to install the module manually with `pip` you can run the
following command. This assumes a Python 3 binary called `python` can be
found on your path.

``` sh
python -m pip install rosetta-soil
```

## `run_rosetta()`

Batch runs of Rosetta models can be done using using `list`,
`data.frame`, `matrix`, `RasterStack`, `RasterBrick` and `SpatRaster`
objects as input.

### `list()` Input Example

``` r
run_rosetta(list(c(30, 30, 40, 1.5), c(55, 25, 20),  c(55, 25, 20, 1.1)),
            rosetta_version = 3)
#>   id model_code theta_r_mean theta_s_mean log10_alpha_mean log10_npar_mean

#> 1    0.09245277
#> 2    0.08428578
#> 3    0.14163567
```

Output `model_code` reflects the number of parameters in the input.

### `data.frame()` Input Example

The `data.frame` interface allows for using using custom column names
and order. If the `vars` argument is not specified it is assumed that
the columns are in the order specified in the `run_rosetta()` manual
page.

``` r
run_rosetta(data.frame(
  d = c(NA, 1.5),
  b = 60,
  a = 20,
  c = 20
), vars = letters[1:4])
#>   id model_code theta_r_mean theta_s_mean log10_alpha_mean log10_npar_mean
#> 1  1          2   0.08994502    0.4301366        -2.426236       0.1756873

#> 2    0.07771481
```

### Soil Data Access / SSURGO Mapunit Aggregate Input Example

This example pulls mapunit/component data from Soil Data Access (SDA).
We use the {soilDB} function `get_SDA_property()` to obtain
representative values for `sand`, `silt`, `clay`, and
`bulk density (1/3 bar)` we run Rosetta on the resulting data.frame (one
row per mapunit) then use raster attribute table (RAT) to display the
results (1:1 with `mukey`).

``` r
library(soilDB)
library(terra)
#> terra 1.6.17
library(rosettaPTF)

# obtain mukey map from SoilWeb Web Coverage Service (800m resolution SSURGO derived)
res <- mukey.wcs(aoi = list(aoi = c(-114.16, 47.65,-114.08, 47.68), crs = 'EPSG:4326'))
#> Loading required namespace: sf

# request input data from SDA
varnames <- c(""sandtotal_r"", ""silttotal_r"", ""claytotal_r"", ""dbthirdbar_r"")
resprop <- get_SDA_property(property = varnames,
                            method = ""Dominant Component (numeric)"",
                            mukeys = unique(values(res$mukey)))

# keep only those where we have a complete set of 4 parameters (sand, silt, clay, bulk density; model code #3)
soildata <- resprop[complete.cases(resprop), c(""mukey"", varnames)]

# run Rosetta on the mapunit-level aggregate data
system.time(resrose <- run_rosetta(soildata[,varnames]))
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>     0.2     0.0     0.2

# transfer mukey to result
resrose$mukey <- soildata$mukey

### *SpatRaster* (terra) Input Example

The above example shows how to create raster output based on *discrete*
(SSURGO polygon derived) data. A more general case is when each raster
cell has “unique” values (i.e. *continuous* raster inputs).
`run_rosetta()` has an S3 method defined for *SpatRaster* input.

We previously merged the input data from SDA (an ordinary *data.frame*)
into the RAT of `res`; exploiting the linkage between `mukey` and raster
cells to make the map. For comparison with the `mukey` results above we
stack de-ratified input layers and create a new *SpatRaster*.

``` r
res3 <- rast(list(
  res2[[""sandtotal_r""]],
  res2[[""silttotal_r""]],
  res2[[""claytotal_r""]],
  res2[[""dbthirdbar_r""]]
))

# SpatRaster to data.frame interface (one call on all cells)
system.time(test2 <- run_rosetta(res3))
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   41.98    9.25   49.46

# make a plot of the predicted Ksat (identical to mukey-based results)
plot(test2, ""log10_Ksat_mean"")
```

<img src=""man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png"" width=""100%"" />

You will notice the results for Ksat distribution are identical since
the same input values were used, but the latter approach took longer to
run. The time difference is the difference of estimating \~40 (1
estimate per mapunit key) versus \~30,000 (1 estimate per raster cell)
sets of Rosetta parameters.

## Extended Output with `Rosetta` S3 Class

### Make a *Rosetta* class instance for running extended output methods

Note that each instance of *Rosetta* has a fixed version and model code,
so if you have heterogeneous input you need to iterate over model code.

``` r
# defaults are version 3 and model code 3 (4 parameters: sand, silt, clay and bulk density)
my_rosetta <- Rosetta(rosetta_version = 3, model_code = 3)
```

### `predict()` Rosetta Parameter Values and Standard Deviations from a *Rosetta* instance

``` r
predict(my_rosetta, list(c(30, 30, 40, 1.5), c(55, 25, 20, 1.1)))

# AgroSmart - A Smart Farming Solution
IoT Based Field Monitorin and Control Platfornm Using MEAN Stack.

## Abstract
We have implemented IOT and smart agriculture techniques to conserve the limiting natural resources and maximize the production of the fields. AgroSmart was directed to make the work of the farmers easier and less complicated. We have approached the solution of this problem by designing certain devices called SmartPods, which are to be sowed in the soil (having a limited coverage) they will provide valuable information like soil quality, humidity, temperature (all the features required to be monitored while farming) easily with the help of controllers and the results are displayed in a webpage which is designed solely for monitoring real time data gathered from the Smart Pods. After analysing the statistical data and graphs we could predict the meteorological conditions of the area, the type of crop suitable for cultivation in that area and the optimum requirements of that crop in the given environment, which helped us in estimating the exact amount of resources required, the crop to be cultivated and what uncertainties to expect from the weather of the region.

## Sections of this Project
This project has a physical layer under ""SmartPODS"", back end framework in ExpressJS and Frontend in Angular. The physical layer can be used over any WiFi enabled microcontroller like NodeMCU (ESP8266) or ESP32.  
You can find all the arduino libraries and the code inside the ``Smart Pods`` Folder.  
The backend API is located under the ``api`` folder.  
And the front-end is located under ``web/dashboard`` folder.

> With this evaluation tool you can check and interpret the results of a modified <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triaxial_shear_test"" target=""_blank"">`geotechnical triaxial test`</a>.
With this appliance it is possible to confine a probe, rise the axial stress and measure the permeability of the probe at all stages.
The tool was developed as part of a joint project called MERID (Microstructural Influence on Reservoir Integrity at Variable Hydromechanical Conditions) funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research as part of GEO:N Project ([Geoforschung für Nachhaltigkeit](https://www.bmbf.de/de/geoforschung-2398.html)) to evaluate the results of a special assembled large triaxial cell.
This tool consists of a backend and a frontend both assembled in MathWorks Matlab.
The backend creates a connection to a MySQL-Database where the results of all experiments stored.

---

## Requirements

 - Matlab Version 2020a or newer
 - [Matlab Curve Fitting Toolbox](https://de.mathworks.com/products/curvefitting.html) for permeability calculations
 - [JDBC MySQL Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) included in Matlab `javaclasspath` (dynamic or static)
 - Configured MySQL database engine (a script creating the database skeleton is [attached](sample/database_generation_script.sql) in this repository) which includes all triaxial test data sets
 
 ---
 
## Setup

 - Have a running MathWorks Matlab 2019b or higher engine with installed curve fitting toolbox.
 - Have a running MySQL engine with a database according to the needs of this tool. To create a valid database you can use the [batch file](sample/database_generation_script.sql) in this repository.
 - Download [JDBC MySQL Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) (platform independent version) to your local machine.
 - Add JDBC MySQL Connector to `javaclasspath` dynamic part
  ```matlab
  >> javaaddpath('/your_folder/mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar')
  ```
 - Check if adding was successful
  ```matlab
  >> javaclasspath
    
    /some_other_folder/some_file.jar
    
        DYNAMIC JAVA PATH

    /your_folder/mysql-connector-java-8.0.20.jar
  ```
 - Download the latest release of Triaxial Test Evaluation Tool to your local machine and include the submodule `water-properties` additionally. As an alternative you can clone the repository via
 `git clone --recurse-submodules --remote-submodules https://github.com/froido/triaxial_test_evaluation_tool.git`
 - Run `GUI.mlapp`
 

---

## Usage

1. Adding triaxial test data sets to the database
2. Start the `Triaxial Test Evaluation Tool` via `GUI.mlapp`.
3. Select a main experiment from the shown list.
4. Evaluate your test results and enjoy.

---

## Additional Hints

 - Matlab has often problems with the timezone set in Oracle MySQL database under Windows systems. CEST (German: MESZ) is unknown for Matlab, which leads to an error. Set the timezone manually to e.g. `+02:00`.
 ```mysql
 SET GLOBAL time_zone = '+02:00';
 ```
 - Due to very big data sets the global buffer size shall be extended in MySQL database to e.g. 4 gigabyte
 ```mysql
 SET GLOBAL innodb_buffer_pool_size=4294967296;
 ```
 - After a couple of changes were performed in the graphs, the GUI of Matlab lags sometimes for unknown reasons. You have two options: kill or wait.

## Summary
> ANZSoilML primer at the [repository wiki](https://github.com/ANZSoilData/ANZSoilML/wiki/ANZSoilML-Primer).

ANZSoilML is an information model that specifies the set of classes, properties, relationships and supporting
vocabularies needed to structure digital information used in the Australian and New Zealand soil sciences. It is
primarily concerned with observed properties of soils and their associated landscape features as specified in the:
- _Australian Soil and Land Survey Field Handbook, Third edition, 2009, The National Committee on Soil and Terrain._
([CSIRO Publishing](https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/5230/))
- _New Zealand Soil Description Handbook, Revised edition, 1995, Milne, J.D.G., Clayden, B., Singleton, P.L., Wilson,
A.D._ ([Manaaki Whenua Digital Library](http://digitallibrary.landcareresearch.co.nz/cdm/ref/collection/p20022coll14/id/79))

The main intention of ANZSoilML is to provide communities of data providers and users with a model that allows them to
publish and parse a consistent set of data across multiple data repositories. End users should be confident that, for a
given version of ANZSoilML, responses from providers will use the same data types, property names and vocabularies.

ANZSoilML also aims for consistency with other environmental datasets. Soil itself does not exist in isolation - its
formation is influenced by climate, hydrology, geology, topography and biology, and in return it influences those
aspects of the environment. This means that to effectively describe and model soil, data describing other parts of the
environment may be required, and aggregating these data is much easier if they are delivered in a consistent way. This
means ANZSoilML has been developed using a policy of re-use - importing and aligning itself with important standards
for observation and sampling data, geology, groundwater and hydrology.

ANZSoilML was derived from OzSoilML, which was developed in Australia by [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/) under the
auspices of the Australian Collaborative Land Evaluation Program ([ACLEP](http://www.clw.csiro.au/aclep/)). Later, CSIRO
worked with New Zealand's [Manaaki Whenua](https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz) to test and refine OZSoilML, this new
version was rebranded as ANZSoilML.

## The current state of ANZSoilML
> Full description at the [repository wiki](https://github.com/ANZSoilData/ANZSoilML/wiki/Current-Version).

The current version of ANZSoilML (2.0.1) has been designed and implemented as a
[Geography Mark-up Language (GML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language) [Application Schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language#Application_schema).
This approach involves the definition and provision of
'[Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_Markup_Language#Features)' (broadly speaking physical things) that
are of interest when dealing with soils. These include (in _italics_):
- _Soil Profiles_ as made up of _Soils_ and their _Horizons_
- Soil _Landscape Features_ (e.g. _Topography_, _Climatic Setting_ and _Vegetation_)
- Soil _Sites_
- Soil _Samples_ and _Specimens_
- _Laboratory Measurements_

ANZSoilML has focussed on defining the Features specific to soil and imported and extended other Application Schema:
- [Observations and Measurements 2.0 (O&M)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_and_Measurements) - soil samples
and laboratory measurements
- [GeoScience Mark-up Language 3.0 (GeoSciML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoSciML) - soil composition and parent
material

The use of GML Application Schema has these technical implications:
- GML is an XML grammar therefore XML documents are provided by default
- The physical model for the XML documents is provided as a collection of XML Schema Documents (XSDs)
([link](http://anzsoil.org/def/schema/))
- Documents are mainly provided via web services conforming to the OGC
[Web Feature Service (WFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) specification
- Documents may be accessed via URLs acting as an identifier for a Feature (so called HTTP URIs) - these may proxy or
redirect to a WFS request or a static document

## The future of ANZSoilML
> Full description at the [repository wiki](https://github.com/ANZSoilData/ANZSoilML/wiki/Future-Work).

ANZSoilML 2.0.1 has defined a rich and robust conceptual model for the description, sampling and analysis of soils, and
the modelling of their distribution, productivity or health. The next steps for the ANZSoilML community are to:
- repackage the data model in a way that separates concepts (the 'data dictionary') from technology (encodings, and
web services and their APIs)
- define a modular framework that allows deployment of a range of tools that use technology and data that are
appropriate to different communities of users

These communities will be varied. They may be made up of any combination (often in the same individual) of:
-  _data providers_ who must publish and exchange rich, well documented data in a way that preserves the quality of the
data without the loss of _any_ content
- _data engineers_ who work with data providers to publish data in ways the meet the needs of users or with users to
extract and transform data according to their needs
- _data scientists_ who may need fast access to raw data for models and simulations with optional access to rich
metadata to help explain anomalies in results; or Semantic Web inferencing tools to discover new patterns in data
- _web developers_ who need simple, terse and fast interfaces that use widely used and supported technology (ReST, JSON
etc)

The tentative workplan for 'ANZSoilML 3' involves:
1. Converting the current GML Application Schema to a technology independent model that can be formally captured using
Semantic Web data modelling tools and also be published using lightweight web tools
2. Defining practices for publishing data in a manner best suited to web developers (particularly the use of JSON and
GeoJSON, and ReSTful interfaces)
3. The definition of a more advanced, but still relatively simple, delivery mechanism using the O&M data types
4. An investigation of the most effective way to deliver complex objects (for example a full soil profile description)

This work will begin in January 2019.

> The OGC is conducting the [ELFIE](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ELFIE/) initiative - a series of Interoperability
> Experiments (IEs) designed to promote web-friendly implementations of linked environmental data. Our vision for
> ANZSoilML as a usable standard closely aligned with other environmental data standards matches the long term vision
> for ELFIE. We are active participants and expect to use the findings of ELFIE to design implement and the new version.

## Contacts
ANZSoilML is developed by an informal group of research organizations that have a responsibility to deliver soil
information to their own scientists but also other agencies and the general public. They work in close consultation with
various environmental Domain Working Groups within the [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.opengeospatial.org/)
(OGC).

The group would be delighted to welcome new members and/or to receive feedback. Contributors do not need to have a
research focus or be members of the OGC, nor do they need to be 'locals'.

The Soil Analyzer is a portable lab that can analyse soil samples and tells the user about it's optical properties. It looks at the texture and describe it as a Particle Size Distribution. This information is presented as a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). It also describes the structure of the soil sample and gives information on the sphericity and roundness / angularity. It does so by analysing the contour of particles, describing them as Fourier Descriptors and using a Neural Network to describe it's properties. Finally it gives the color properties in a histogram in the CIE La*b* colorspace, which show correlations with the fertility of the soil. and a histogram of the Redness Index, which gives has a correlation on the iron content.

The analyse is performed on a Beaglebone Black rev C. with the following image Linux arm 3.8.13-bone68 #1 SMP Sat Nov 22 06:51:58 UTC 2014 armv7l armv7l armv7l GNU/Linux

The soil is analyzed using it optical properties. This is done with a 5MP USB webcam with a maximum magnification of 300x. It has a custom cape with which the user can control the device.

Although it uses openCV most Vision algorithms are custom written (part of my Minor demand). openCV is used for camera aquisition and picture storage mostly. This project make use of custom vision, object detection and classification algorithmes.

Matlab/Octave code to compute displacements, velocities and strains due to the penetration of a tube using the Strain Path Method ([Baligh, 1985](http://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9410(1985)111:9(1108))).

The Shallow Strain Path Method ([Sagaseta et al, 1998](http://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9853(199710)21:10<687::AID-NAG897>3.0.CO;2-3)) is also considered.

Both codes follow the approach proposed by [Sagaseta et al (1998)](http://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9853(199710)21:10<687::AID-NAG897>3.0.CO;2-3): the tube moves from the far field to the center of the domain.

Elliptical integrals are computed according to [Hollos (2012)](http://www.exstrom.com/math/elliptic/ellipint.html) since it is by far more eficient than using the Matlab build-in elliptical integrals.

Data postprocessing is done in [GiD](http://www.gidhome.com/).



### Octave compatibility with symbolic generation

The code is fully compatible with Octave. However, the symbolic generation of these files is slow and probably should be changed. 

The symbolic toolbox of octave might be installed (in Linux) by typping in the octave command window:

> pkg install -forge symbolic

and loaded with:
   
> pkg load symbolic

It might be necessary to install sympy. In a terminal, enter the following line:

> sudo apt-get install python-sympy

## Aim

Helping trees to adapt quickly to climate change by using the genetic information and metabolic pathways of all the organisms existing in intimate partnership with the tree – the microbiome.


![TRMP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90012658/156644294-4c26c4df-19ed-4a10-b725-5193f16aa790.jpg)

Nature Microbiology 3:977-982.

## Outcomes

1. Showing how microbiome associations can alter trees’ drought tolerance.

2. Determining if the microbiome relationships that co-evolved with Pinus radiata have been altered/lost with domestication of radiata and if this affects how it adapts to environmental change.

3. Establishing Pinus radiata as the global model for tree-microbiome research, providing a platform for transformative tree and silvicultural science.

4. Ensuring the science is adopted by (a) engaging the international scientific community, (b) working with industry stakeholders, and (c) focussing on science excellence and communication.

5. Developing relationships with conservation and indigenous groups to enable microbiomedriven conservation of Aotearoa NZ’s indigenous tree species and provide new opportunities to expand the diversity of all forests.

6. Creating enduring tree/microbiome groups with increased resilience to climate change and emerging stressors to:

      •  Rescue at-risk species

      • Improve afforestation outcomes by supporting more diverse, productive forests
      
      • Support more diverse, productive forests with reduced needs for external inputs

Together, these outcomes will help underpin the carbon neutral economy that is central our government responses to climate change as a species

pygada is a python package to perform automated exploratory and geostatistical data-analysis.

It is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DOV-Vlaanderen/pygada) and development is coordinated by [Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen (DOV)](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be). \
DOV aggregates data about soil, subsoil and groundwater of Flanders and makes them publicly available.
With this package DOV offers a tool to perform data-analysis on the data from DOV. Nevertheless, this package also works for a private dataset.

To get started, see the documentation at https://pygada.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.

Please note that using DOV data with pygada is governed by the same [disclaimer](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/page/disclaimer) that applies to the other DOV services. Be sure to consult it when using DOV data with pygada.

The dataset is a very small dataset meant for beginners to build ML models using this dataset currently. A small dataset helps in learning without wasting hefty time in training the model for half an hour or more and expensive computation. The results won't be really great as the dataset is really low and thus overfitting and other issues.

## Objectives - 
• Designed a classification model with 5 classes and 98% testing accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network. 

• Applied Data Augmentation and reduced validation losses by 30% by applying MobileNetV2 Architecture.

The irrigation PiHAT can be used for the irrigation of small gardens/vegetable patches via soil moisture level sensing and water dispensing. It may also be used in lab environments where scientists need to hold the moisture level of the soil at a constant level.

An optional configuration, which shows the modular ability of the HAT, is to replace the moisture sensors with a float switch or humidity sensor to either fill up pools; ponds; or water tanks or to operate ventilation systems if an enclosed space reaches a maximum humidity level.

The PiHAT will allow more advanced users to continuously perform measurements or monitor the soil moisture levels by sending its input from the sensors into the main Pi GPIO header.

# Getting Started

Here's how to get started with your own Irrigation System PiHAT project!

## **Step 1:**

Clone this repository to your computer to get started by using the following command line git command:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/ryxcam002/IrrigationPiHat`<br><br>

## **Step 2:**

Change directory into the newly cloned repo using:<br>
`cd IrrigationPiHat`<br><br>

## **Step 3:**

Make sure you have the latest version of KiCAD and LTSpice installed. The download links to these open source programs can be found at:<br>
KiCAD - https://www.kicad.org/download/<br>
LTSpice - https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html<br><br>

## **Step 4:**

Go through the design files to check if all is working well. If you wish to make any changes to the design, pay particular attention to the `Individual Module Schematics`, `Combined Schematic & PCB`, and `Simulation Files` folders.<br><br>

- The `Individual Module Schematics` folder is where you will find each submodule KiCAD schematic design. These can be modified individually to suit your needs.<br>
- The `Simulation Files` folder is where the V2.0 circuits weere simulated to determine if all parameters ffor circuit components were setup correctly.<br>
- The `Combined Schematic & PCB` folder is where all the submodules have been combined to form a single schematic, ready for PCB footprint assignment and BOM generation.<br><br>

## **Step 5:**

Generate gerber files for final PCB manufacturing. To do this, open the `.kicad_pcb` file in the `Combined Schematic & PCB` folder, ensure that all components/PCB specifications are correct and generate the gerber files from there.

## **Step 6:**

Manufacture PCB and solder all components or have this done by the manufacturer if they support this. You now have a micro irrrigation controller!

In detail, this repository stores data & code following the order of figures occurring in our manuscript:

For each figure (seven in total, of which 3 are supporting figures), the source data (.csv) and the corresponding code (.ipynb) doing the statistical analyses (in R/Python) and drawing the figures (in Python 3.6) in Jupyter Notebook are deposited in a seperate folder. More importantly, all 'real' source data, which are literally model outputs, are provided in the /Source Data folder. These source data have the potential to be further tapped into for other analyses.

With JupyterNotebook, step-by-step analyses are demonstrated, facilitating reproducible analyses. Some essential Python packages (Pandas and Numpy, as well as Matplotlib), of course, should be installed before any real re-runs of these notebooks.

Any questions should be directed to B. Wang at wbwenwu@gmail.com or bw8my@virginia.edu

## Introduction

Most of what we know about the elemental composition of Mars comes from orbiting spacecraft and landers.
If you google something about this, all you can find is “there ‘may’ be iron, magnesium, calcium, etc”. There is no proper confirmation as to which element is present where and in what quantity.
In order to make a proper plan for living on Mars, we need to know all these details.


## Project Features

1) Find the weather, temperature and pressure of the planet.

2) Find the soil moisture which will help us realize if water is available in the soil in that area.

3) Feature detection for planetary exploration.


## Rover Features

1) Solar Powered.

2) Autonomous (using Image Processing).

3) Bore to dig into the soil.

4) Automatic wind protection.

The goal of {labtaxa} is to provide ‘Lab Data Mart’
(<https://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/>) database snapshots for use
in R. This repository is an R package used to download and cache the
contents of the Lab Data Mart GeoPackage database.

## Docker

To get up and running quickly you can use the Docker container. The
`labtaxa` container is based on
[`""rocker/rstudio:latest""`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/rstudio). In
addition to the standard RStudio tools, the container has the cached Lab
Data Mart GeoPackage (containing lab and spatial data) and the companion
morphologic database (derived from NASIS pedon descriptions)
pre-downloaded. Also, the results of `soilDB::fetchLDM()` called on the
LDM GeoPackage data source are cached as an R object file (.rds).
Finally, a variety of useful R packages are pre-installed. All can be
accessed via an RStudio Server web browser interface.

From Docker Hub:

``` sh
docker pull brownag/labtaxa:latest
```

Or from GitHub:

``` sh
docker pull ghcr.io/brownag/labtaxa:latest
```

Once you have a local copy of the `labtaxa` container you can run:

``` sh
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=mypassword -v ~/Documents:/home/rstudio/Documents -e ROOT=TRUE brownag/labtaxa
```

Then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8787`. The
default username is `rstudio` and the default password is `mypassword`.

## R Package Installation

You can install the development version of {labtaxa} from GitHub:

``` r
if (!require(""labtaxa"")) 
 remotes::install_github(""brownag/labtaxa"")
```

## Example

Download (and cache) the latest Lab Data Mart SQLite snapshot from
<https://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/> like so:

``` r
library(labtaxa)
ldm <- get_LDM_snapshot()
```

Downloaded and derived files will be cached in platform-specific
directory specified by `ldm_data_dir()` using `cache_labtaxa()`

In the Docker container the snapshot has already been created and cached
from the latest data (as of the last time the container was built).
Updates to the method used to create the cache, as well as scheduled
(monthly) updates occur.

The cached data help to get off and running quickly analyzing the entire
KSSL database using the [{aqp}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=aqp)
R package toolchain.

The lab data are pre-loaded in a large SoilProfileCollection object
(over 65,000 profiles). In only a few seconds from when you have the
Docker container loaded, you can be filtering and processing the lab
data object. Downloading archives of the complete databases can take 10s
of minutes to a couple hours (depending on internet connection). Only in
cases where the absolute most recent data are needed would require doing
a cache update.

The downloaded databases (GeoPackage, SQLite) are queried locally using
{soilDB} functions `fetchLDM()` and `fetchNASIS()`. The {soilDB}
functions can take a couple minutes to process on larger databases like
this, so the container building process front loads these more costly
processing steps. Querying the data using a method like this essentially
precedes all analyses. soilDB provides standard aggregation methods that
produce {aqp} SoilProfileCollections, which provide a convenient data
structure for working with horizon and site level data associated with
specific soil profiles.

When you start up {labtaxa} in the Docker container you will have the
latest database and the first-step data object (as if you ran the
{soilDB} functions) readily available for post-processing for answering
specific questions. See demo.R in the container home folder to get started.

``` r
ldm <- load_labtaxa()

length(ldm)
#> [1] 65403
```

If you are running on your own machine you will have to run
`get_LDM_snapshot()` at least once (as above) before the
`load_labtaxa()` command works. In future runs you will not need to
re-download or prepare the data unless you need to update the cache.

# CROPify
A Flask-based web application for farmers to find out the crops which can grow perfectly on their fields.

### This is my submission for HackDSC-2021.

# Motivation:
Traditional cropping patterns are not effective in today's rapidly changing, unpredicted climate and polluted soils. Likewise, every region is unique in relation to each other and has various properties. Your goal is to design a system to predict the most suitable crop for that region, harvest time, plantation pattern and maintenance of that crop for better yield utilizing information like soil quality, weather, resources and other factors that affect crop production.
<p> 
Keeping this in mind, I have created a web application which will help farmers to identify the best crop that they can grow in their respective fields, keeping in mind all the properties discussed before.

# Data-set Used:
For this application, I used datasets from Kaggle.
- [Crop Recommendation ](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) 

# Algorithms Used:
I have used a variety of algorithms for this problem, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest to name a few.
<br>
For me, Random Forest has worked wonders, as it gave me 100% accuracy.
If you want an in-depth explaination on random Forest and how do they work, feel free to checkout <a href = ""https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2"">this article</a>.

<br>
# Features Used:
### The features used to solve this problem are:
1. Nitrogen Level: The percentage of nitrogen present in the soil.
2. Phosphorus Level: The percentage of phosphorus present in the soil.
3. Potasium Level: The percentage of potassium present in the soil.
4. Temperature: Temperature of the soil.
5. Humidity Level: Percentage of humidity of the soil.
6. PH Value: PH value of the soil.
7. Rainfall: The amount of rainfall(In mm).

# Functionalities of this application:
 1. On putting features like nitrogen %, phosphorus % etc, a farmer could find out which crop will suit his field the best.
 2. The farmer would also know the type of crop to field(for eg; a Rabi, or a Kharif crop). The application will also provide the suitable sowing and harvesting dates for the crops.
 3. After finding out the name of the crop, the farmer could also find out the importance of each feature; so as to get more acquainted with how the different features affect the soil.

# Future Improvements:
 1. An Crop Disease predictor could be added to this application. It could take input in for of an image, and predict if it is diseased or not.
 2. A feature in which after a farmer finds out about the most suitable crop, he could directy call any supplier of the said crop.
 3. This web application is not mobile-first. So if anyone out there could make it mobile-reponsive, that'd be great.

# Issues:
 1. The designing part of the web application is in a bit of mess😅.
 2. The UI could be improved.
 3. The web application is a bit slow during rendering. So anything to help speed up rendering would be great. 

# Hosting:
This application is hosted on Heroku:
https://cropify-northkeys.herokuapp.com/
<br>
P.S: It will take a ittle time to get started, but it's worth the wait!

# nmrrr

This script is designed for batch processing and analysis of **NMR
r**esults in **R** (nmrrr).

Use this script for:  
(a) plotting spectra  
(b) calculating relative abundance of functional groups  
(c) peak assignments

Before using this script, NMR spectra must be processed in MestreNova
(phase corrected, baseline corrected, deconvoluted, peak picked,
normalized).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2021-06-09 update: We are currently streamlining this workflow by
converting the script into reproducible functions. They can be found in
`code/nmrrr_workflow/`. -KFP

2021-07-10 update: The `vignettes` directory contains tutorials on how
to use this package. The .md files are the rendered Markdown reports,
and the .Rmd files are the source files for the reports. - KFP

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example spectra:  
spectra processed in MestreNova, with automated Global Spectral
Deconvolution.  
Water peak removed during processing. Avoid using DMSO and water regions
for further analyses.

### spectra plot version 1: with banded regions for bins

This is good for visualization, not necessarily ideal for manuscripts.

![gg\_nmr1](images/spectra_1.png)

### spectra plot version 2: with bracketed regions for bins

Preferred for manuscripts.

![gg\_nmr2](images/spectra_2.png)

These bins were obtained from [Mitchell et al. 2018, *Soil
Systems*](https://doi.org/10.3390/soils2010008).  
(1) aliphatic polymethylene and methyl groups (0.6-1.3 ppm); (2) N- and
O-substituted aliphatic (1.3–2.9 ppm); (3) O-alkyl (2.9–4.1 ppm); (4)
α-proton of peptides (4.1–4.8 ppm); (5) anomeric proton of carbohydrates
(4.8–5.2 ppm); (6) aromatic and phenolic (6.2–7.8 ppm); and (7) amide
(7.8–8.4 ppm). The peak at 2.50 ppm arises from the solvent (DMSO-d6).

This repository contains all the procedure and the file necessary to the procedure to convert Irish Soil Information System data (http://soils.teagasc.ie) into a SURFEX (https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/surfex/) file input.


# Requirements


numpy
shapefile
pyproj
sys
osgeo
matplotlib
mpl_toolkits

# Description


The Irish Soil Information System data are Shapefiles (.shp) containing location of associations of soil from the sampling (or series) collected around Ireland. Unfortunately these Shapefiles do not contain sand and clay fraction however it can be found using other informations available on the Irish Soil Information System website (http://soils.teagasc.ie)


The repository is divided in 4 different subfolders:
- *input_files*: contains get_all_associations.php and get_all_series specific files from the teagasc dataset and it is recommended to set the teagasc file and the reference dataset here
- *conversion_national_to_grid*: contains all the scripts used to convert the national dataset to the desired grid
- *blending*: contains all the scripts necessary to blend the national dataset with a reference dataset
- *plots*: contains different scripts to plot the data at different stages

 # How to use it
1. Reduce the size of the reference dataset around the desired area:

To gain computational time it is recommended to use the gdal_translate (https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_translate.html) command:
gdal_translate -a_srs ’+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs’ -projwin -12 60 -2 50 [inputfile] [outputfile.tif] 
where -12 60 and -2 50 respectively the upper right and lower right points (or the most north-westerly and
south easterly points), and store the outputfile.tif file in the input_file directory and run the scripts using it.

2. Download the national dataset 
Choose on of the (.shp) files available in http://soils.teagasc.ie and store it in the input files directory

3. Conversion of the national data to the desired grid:
run the file conversion_national_to_grid/regrid_teagasc_data.py with the parameters set in conversion_national_to_grid/config.cfg.

4. Blend of the national data with the reference dataset:
run the file blending/read_config_blending.py with parameter set in blending/config_blending.cfg.


5. Merge the newly created blend into the new dataset :
gdal_merge.py -o [outputfile] -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE [file1] [file2]}} can merge 2 dataset at different coordinates with [file2] data covering [data1] when they overlap. -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE defines the compression format

6. If needed convert the tif file to dir: 

gdal_translate -of EHdr -ot Byte [input.tif] [output.dir] allows to create the .dir file input for SURFEX. Before running it in SURFEX or HARMONIE the corresponding output.hdr file needs to be created as follow:

one coment line

nodata: 0 

north: [HDR_NORTH]

south: [HDR_SOUTH]

west:  [HDR_WEST]

east:  [HDR_EAST]

rows:  [HDR_ROWS]

cols:  [HDR_COLS]

recordtype: recordtype: integer 8 bits

7. OPTIONAL plotting directory:

gather different script to display the data at different stage

## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

You can download the compendium as a zip from from these URLs:
<https://github.com/henningte/hklmirs/> or
<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6325760>

Or you can install this compendium as an R package, hklmirs, from GitHub
with:

``` r
remotes::install_github(""henningte/hklmirs"")
```

## How to use

#### Reproduce the analyses

To reproduce the analyses for the paper, open the RStudio project
included in this research compendium and run the Rmarkdown script in
`analysis/paper/001-paper-main.rmd`.

Running the whole script takes about 12 hours and occupies additional
disk space of \~2 Gb.

Alternatively, the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) can be used to build a
Docker image from which all analyses can be reproduced. The Dockerfile
ensures that all required dependencies are installed (e.g. specific R
packages; this is managed using the R package
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)).

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) provides instructions how to build a Docker
image from the Dockerfile and how to run the image in a Docker
container. It occupies disk space of \~7 Gb.

When the Docker image runs in a container, go to `localhost:8787` in
your Browser. You will find an RStudio interface where you can log in
with username `rstudio` and password `hkl`. Here you can find the
Rmarkdown scripts (`hklmirs/analysis/paper/001-paper-main.rmd`) as
described above.

### Contributions

We welcome contributions from everyone. Before you get started, 1607,Soil-Sensing-Device,TheGreatBuddo,N/A,https://github.com/TheGreatBuddo/Soil-Sensing-Device,https://api.github.com/repos/TheGreatBuddo/Soil-Sensing-Device,"A Low-Cost Soil Sensing Project developed at Twin Cities Engineering, University of Mankato","# Soil-Sensing-Device Readme

Welcome to Twin Cities Engineering's project on soil health monitoring 
through gas-based measurement! Soil health plays a critical role in
agriculture and environmental sustainability. Measuring gases in soil pore 
spaces is an effective way to monitor soil health, providing valuable 
information about the soil's nutrient content and microorganism activity. 
However, commercially available gas-based soil health measurement devices 
are prohibitively expensive, limiting their accessibility to farmers and 
soil scientists. To address this issue, our engineering project team is 
developing a low-cost DIY soil gas sensing unit capable of 
measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane concentrations at 
four soil depths every hour. Our goal is to create a prototype 
that is affordable, portable, and easy to use, 
empowering more people to measure and monitor soil health.

Our project is centered around a device that attaches to four soil 
probes of varying lengths (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 meter) to extract 
soil gases. These probes are placed in a 1-meter squared area of soil, 
assuming that the soil gas concentrations will remain constant. 
The device has four ports for tubes that connect from the probes 
to the device, and each port connects to a solenoid valve inside the 
device. These valves can be opened and closed by a Mayfly microcontroller, 
allowing the device to be exposed to one probe at a time. 
A sensor chamber houses four sensors, including 
an Alphasense IRC-AT carbon dioxide sensor, Alphasense O2-A3 oxygen sensor,
and TGS2611-E00 methane sensor, along with a bme280 temperature, pressure,
and humidity sensor. The final component in the sensor chamber is a 
heating element, which is designed to prevent condensation from forming 
and potentially damaging the sensors. If the bme280 detects a dew point, 
the heating element is activated.

All work accomplished can be found in the Final Design Document and more
discussion about the project. A poster has been developed for this project

**Introduction:**  

SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into OpenGL. It can load TGA and DDS files, and to perform common functions needed in loading OpenGL textures. SOIL can also be used to save and load images in a variety of formats.

This is a clone of Simple OpenGL Image Library from http://lonesock.net/soil.html which hasn't changed since July 7, 2008.

I wanted to work with the code and seeing it was MIT license and the original svn repo is offline, I figured it was acceptable to post it here with some changes to the codebase and added the Cmake build file.

**Installation:**  

SOIL is meant to be used as a static library (as it's tiny). 

Simply include SOIL.h in your C or C++ file, link in the static library, and then use any of SOIL's functions. The file SOIL.h contains simple doxygen style documentation. (If you use the static library, no other header files are needed besides SOIL.h)

You can compile it like any other CMAKE project, simply make a folder named ""build"" and run
```
cmake ..
make

```
**Usage:**
load an image file directly as a new OpenGL texture

    GLuint tex_2d = SOIL_load_OGL_texture
    (
      ""img.png"",
      SOIL_LOAD_AUTO,
      SOIL_CREATE_NEW_ID,
      SOIL_FLAG_MIPMAPS | SOIL_FLAG_INVERT_Y | SOIL_FLAG_NTSC_SAFE_RGB | SOIL_FLAG_COMPRESS_TO_DXT
    );

check for an error during the load process

    if( 0 == tex_2d )
    {
      printf( ""SOIL loading error: '%s'\n"", SOIL_last_result() );
    }

load another image, but into the same texture ID, overwriting the last one

    tex_2d = SOIL_load_OGL_texture
    (
      ""some_other_img.dds"",
      SOIL_LOAD_AUTO,
      tex_2d,
      SOIL_FLAG_DDS_LOAD_DIRECT
    );

load 6 images into a new OpenGL cube map, forcing RGB

    GLuint tex_cube = SOIL_load_OGL_cubemap
    (
      ""xp.jpg"",
      ""xn.jpg"",
      ""yp.jpg"",
      ""yn.jpg"",
      ""zp.jpg"",
      ""zn.jpg"",
      SOIL_LOAD_RGB,
      SOIL_CREATE_NEW_ID,
      SOIL_FLAG_MIPMAPS
    );

load and split a single image into a new OpenGL cube map, default format
face order = East South West North Up Down => ""ESWNUD"", case sensitive!

    GLuint single_tex_cube = SOIL_load_OGL_single_cubemap
    (
      ""split_cubemap.png"",
      ""EWUDNS"",
      SOIL_LOAD_AUTO,
      SOIL_CREATE_NEW_ID,
      SOIL_FLAG_MIPMAPS
    );

actually, load a DDS cubemap over the last OpenGL cube map, default format
try to load it directly, but give the order of the faces in case that fails
the DDS cubemap face order is pre-defined as SOIL_DDS_CUBEMAP_FACE_ORDER

    single_tex_cube = SOIL_load_OGL_single_cubemap

Matlab codes to simulate the coupled hydro-mechanical problem at pseudo-static conditions (**u**-p<sub>w</sub> formulation) using the Finite Element method and node-based smoothed finite element method.

In addition to a fully implicit time integration approach, explicit Runge-Kutta time-marching schemes are also considered.


Several types of elements are considered: T3T3 employs linear interpolants for both displacement and water pressure, T6T3 uses a quadratic shape functions for displacements whereas water pressure is discretized with linear functions and T6T6 describes both field with quadratic interpolants. Q4Q4 employs bilinear shape functions for both nodal variables whereas Q8Q4 uses quadratic shape functions for displacements and bilinar interpolants for water pressure. 

A three field element has displacement, volumetric strain and water pressure as nodal variables, which are discretized with linear shape functions (T3T3T3) in triangles and bilinear interpolants (Q4Q4Q4) in quadrilater elements. These elements have two stabilization terms.

Additionally, node-based smoothed finite elements are considered. This implementation is only valid for linear triangular elements and bilinear quadrilateral elements.


Constitutive models: linear elasticity, non-linear elasticity (pressure-dependent hypo-elastic law) and Subloading Modified Cam Clay [(Hashiguchi, 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48821-9)

### Matlab versions

The code has been tested in Matlab R2019a, R2020a and R2022b.

### Submodules

Some of the constitutive models (elastoplastic) are available in another [repository](https://github.com/lluis-mv/ExplicitStressIntegration)

## Sign convention
Computational geomechanics sign conventions is used in this implementation: in the water pressure field compression pressures are positive values whereas negative values of the effective Cauchy stress tensor denote compression.

CN-WS is a model that can be used to
simulate soil erosion, sediment transport, water and sediment routing and
flow run-off in time and space. The package combines three existing submodels:

 - The Curve Number model (CN) for simulating flow run-off.
 - The WaTEM/SEDEM model (WS) for simulating erosion and over-land sediment
   transport.
 - The routing algorithm for simulating water and sediment routing over land.

CN-WS is developed to assess soil erosion on
agricultural fields, sediment transport through the landscape and sediment
delivery to watercourses and sewage systems. As the impact of soil erosion
mitigation measures is incorporated, the model can also be used to evaluate soil
erosion management measures and compare mitigation strategies.

This Python script allows you to download daily temperature data from NASA's Power API for specific geographic coordinates. The data is obtained in CSV format and can be used for various purposes, including input to the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) module.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries installed (you can install them using pip):
  - **requests**: Used for making HTTP requests.
  - **pandas**: Used for data manipulation.
  - **re**: Regular expressions library for text processing.
## Usage
1.Modify the locations list with the latitude and longitude coordinates for the locations you are interested in. You can add or remove coordinates as needed.

1.Customize the base_url variable if necessary. The default URL fetches daily maximum and minimum temperature data for Renewable Energy (RE) communities from 1982-01-01 to 2017-12-31. You can adjust the parameters, community, start date, and end date as needed.

1.Run the script by executing it with Python:   ***Nasatmpdata_for_swat.py***

1.The script will download temperature data for each location in the locations list and save it as CSV files with filenames like tmp{LAT}.csv and corresponding text files tmp{LAT}.txt.

## Output
For each location specified in the **locations** list, you will get two files:

- **'tmp{LAT}.csv'**: A CSV file containing daily temperature data with columns 'T2M_MAX' and 'T2M_MIN'.
- **'tmp{LAT}.txt'**: A CSV file with the same data, but with columns renamed to the date in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., '19820101' for January 1, 1982).
## Notes
The script uses the latitude to generate a unique filename for each location by removing non-alphanumeric characters from the latitude value.
Make sure to adjust the file paths in the script (**pd.read_csv** and **nasa.to_csv**) according to your system's configuration.
The script currently saves the data in the same directory as the script itself. You can modify the save path as needed.
Remember to comply with NASA's data usage policies and terms when using the data obtained through this script.

SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into OpenGL.
You can find the source code of SOIL at the [official page](https://www.lonesock.net/soil.html).

The library can be used ""as is"" or compiled right on your computer. 
Unfortunately the static library downloaded for the mentioned page didn't work for me so I compiled it on my iMac 2017 with macos High Sierra on board.

This library was successfully tested with OpenGL while making a small 2D game.

### How to use:
Just clone or dowload the library as well as header file and use it while compiling your program.

### Enjoy!

The webinterface can now be reached with the DNS name. The DNS name is equal to the name of the sensor. <br>
(Example : http://kitchenplant.local) <br>
<br>
New from version 1.1.5: <br>
After switching on the sensor, a measurement is taken every 15 seconds to check the values. (Number of measurements: 20 - start mode)  <br>
After these 20 measurements, the measurement takes place again at the set interval.  <br>
<br>
New from version 1.1.2: <br>
The sensor now also works without MQTT (do not specify the MQTT host in the captive portal) <br>
The sensor can now also be calibrated during operation.
