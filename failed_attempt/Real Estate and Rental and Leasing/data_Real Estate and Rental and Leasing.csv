## February 2023 update

PropertyWebBuilder is now a standalone Ruby on Rails app (it is no longer a Ruby on Rails engine). It has also been upgraded to use Rails 6 and Ruby 3!

I am currently working on a Rails 7 upgrade which will use the wonderful vite-ruby gem to re-implement the admin panel with vue.js and the quasar framework:

https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/tree/vite

Also, I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting and would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

[https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)


## Motivation

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.


## Demo

<!-- You can try out a demo at [https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com](https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com/)

To see the admin panel, login as user admin@example.com with a password of ""pwb123456"". -->

There was previously a demo hosted on heroku but since they ended the free plan I have had to take it down.

![pwb_iphone_landing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1741198/22990222/bfec0168-f3b8-11e6-89df-b950c4979970.png)


## Create your own real estate website with no technical knowledge

The simplest way to create a website with PropertyWebBuilder is to use Heroku, a trusted service provider.  They no longer have the free tier which was a great selling point but are still worth trying out.

Just [sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity), click the button below and in a few minutes your site will be ready

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder)

Here is a video about how to deploy to heroku:

[![Depoly PWB to heroku](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hyapXTwGyr4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyapXTwGyr4 ""Deploy PWB to heroku"")


## Install locally

PWB was previously designed to be included as an engine in an existing Ruby on Rails app. This is no longer the case and you can now run it directly as a standalone app.

It can also be installed locally as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder.git
cd property_web_builder
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails pwb:db:seed
```

## Rails Version

PropertyWebBuilder runs with Rails '~> 6.0'

## Ruby Version

PropertyWebBuilder runs with Ruby >= 3.0.0.

## Getting started

Get started with the application by following the installation steps.

> Prerequisite
>
> - [Docker and docker-compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the GitHub repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate.git
```

### 2. Build an Start the application

To effectively build and run the application, make use of the `mre` executable on Linux. If you are using Windows, utilize `mre.exe`, whereas on Mac, opt for `mre-macos`.

```shell
$ cd microrealestate
$ ./mre build
```

When building the first time, you can expect a series of questions to configure the application. Answer the questions as prompted to tailor the application to your specific needs. Once you've completed this interactive configuration, a `.env` file will be generated, containing your settings.

```
? Have you created a mailgun account for sending emails (https://www.mailgun.com/)? No

? Enter the URL to access the landlord front-end: http://localhost:8080/landlord

? Enter the URL to access the tenant front-end (it should share the same domain and port as the landlord front-end URL): http://localhost:8080/tenant
```

Once the build process has been completed, execute the following command to launch the application:

```shell
$ ./mre start
```

Once the application has started successfully, you will find a link displayed in the console to access the application.

Simply copy the link and paste into your preferred web browser to access the application's interface.

This repository is deprecated in favor of [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate).

The new version uses latest stack on the front-end (NextJS, ReactJS, MobX). The split between front and back-end code is more obvious and the UI has been fully rewritten.

Also, additional functionalities were added in order to customize the application to the landlords needs.

Developer wise [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate) should be easier to enhance and to maintain.

## Loca

### What is Loca?

This nodejs project is a tentative of web application that offers a toolkit for owners of buildings, flats, offices, meeting rooms, car parks, letter boxes...

The idea is to make easy the management of properties and occupants by proposing many services:

- Gather all information of your properties and occupants in one place
- Create rent contract from templates available in the system
- Follow the rent payments month by month
- Template letters for recovery of not paid rents

![Loca](http://www.nuageprive.fr/images/loca-sample.png 'Open source real estate management')

### Getting started

Follow instructions from [here](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate#getting-started)

### Technical Stack

Back-end:

Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS (templates), PassportJS (authentication)

Front-End:

JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, and [frontexpress](https://github.com/camelaissani/frontexpress)

Build system based on RollupJS

### Why do I created this application?

Simply to help my best friend and I to manage properties that we rent.

Above all, to have a good reason to play with node and javascript :-)

A library that enables programmatic interaction with [Daft.ie](https://daft.ie). Daft.ie has nationwide coverage and contains about 80% of the total available properties in Ireland.


## Installation

Daftlistings is available on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/daftlistings/). You can install daftlistings using pip.

``` bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install daftlistings
```

To install the development version, run:

``` bash
pip install https://github.com/AnthonyBloomer/daftlistings/archive/dev.zip
```

## Usage

``` python
from daftlistings import Daft

daft = Daft()
listings = daft.search()

for listing in listings:
    print(listing.title)
    print(listing.price)
    print(listing.daft_link)
    # ...
```

By default, the Daft search function iterates over each page of results and appends each Listing object to the array that is returned. If you wish to limit the number of results that are returned you can use the `max_pages` argument.

```python
daft.search(max_pages=1)
```

## Approach:

- load Pandas DataFrame containing (Dec-17) housing data retrieved by means of the [following scraper](https://github.com/Weesper1985/Funda-Scraper), supplemented with longitude and latitude coordinates mapped to zip code (via [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/1.10.0/#)
- do some simple data exploration / visualisation
- remove non-numeric data, NaNs, and outliers (everything above 3 x standard dev of y)
- define explanatory variables (surface,latitude,and longitude) and independent variable (price EUR)
- split the data in train and test sets (+ normalise independent variables where required) 
- find the optimal model parameters using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)'s GridSearchCV
- fit the model using GridSearchCV's optimal parameters
- evaluate estimator performance by means of 5 fold 'shuffled' nested cross-validation
- predict cross validated estimates of y for each data point and plot on scatter diagram vs true y

# Online Rental Property Manager (ORPM)

<img src=""https://cdn.bigprof.com/screencasts/online-rental-property-manager-demo-6.3.gif"" title=""ORPM screencast"" alt=""ORPM (Online rental property manager) screencast"" width=""960"" height=""465"" style=""width: 100%; max-width: 960px; height: auto;"">

Online rental property manager (ORPM) is a free open source app.
It allows you to manage landlords, rental properties, units, 
applications, leases and tenants. Add all details related to the tenants, i.e. references, 
rental history, employment history and income overview.

ORPM was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/).
So you can easily customize it to add/remove 
details or any extra functionality to fit your own requirements. 
ORPM is a responsive, multi-user web-based application that you can access from your PC, tablet, 
mobile or any other device. 

### [‚á© Download the latest release](https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-rental-property-manager/releases/latest) ([_Changelog_](https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-rental-property-manager/releases))

## Features

* Manage applicants and tenants.
* Add, search and manage applications and leases.
* Manage applicants/tenants rental history, employment history and other references.
* Manage landlords, properties, and units.
* Reports (created by [Summary Reports plugin for AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/applications/summary-reports-plugin)):
	* **Applicants by status** review how many new applicants vs. tenants vs. previous tenants do we have.
	* **Applications/leases over time** review the growth of leases and applications over time.
	* **Applications/leases by property** review the growth of demand for each property over time.
	* **Leases by property over time** review the growth of actual leases for each property over time.
	* **Lease value by property over time** check the monthly rental revenue for each property and its growth over time.
* Efficient management of applications status through mass update of multiple applications.
* Quickly view leases starting and ending each month through a calendar view -- also allows adding and editing (created by [Calendar plugin for AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/applications/calendar-plugin)).

This application was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/),
and therefore it shares the features of any AppGini application as well, including:

* Responsive Bootstrap apps that work beautifully on any device.
* Support for multiple users and user groups, with easy-to-configure per-table permissions.
* Quick and advanced search.
* Export your data to CSV to work on them in Excel or other spreadsheets.
* Import already-existing data from CSV files through a powerful import wizard.

*Disclaimer: AppGini itself is not an open source application,
but: 1. applications generated by AppGini can be distributed as open source with any
license of choice. 2. You don't need to install AppGini in order to use this app.*

---

## Installation

This is a PHP/MySQL web application that you run from a browser. You can install it either locally
on your own PC, or to a web/intranet server.

### 1. Try the live demo

* We provide a live demo with sample data [here](https://demos.appgini.com/online-rental-property-manager/)
* You can access the demo as a guest user, with read-only access to data.
* You can also access the demo using the following credentials:
  * Username: `demo`
  * Password: `demo`

  The above credentials allow browsing the sample data with read-only access,
  as well as adding new data, with full access (view, edit, delete). Data added
  through the demo account is automatically removed periodically to prevent
  cluttering the demo app.

### 2. Trying it out using Gitpod (requires a github account)

This application is ready to run within the Gitpod IDE.
This will allow you to try the application out and develop it for your needs.
All you will need is a web browser. _Do not use this in production!!!_

**[Launch private demo on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/bigprof-software/online-rental-property-manager)**

The app would take a couple of minutes to launch.
Afterwards, you'll see the welcome screen of the app in the right part of the window, where you can start the setup wizard.
When prompted to enter the database name, database username and datatbase password, you should enter `appgini` for all.

Gitpod is intended for previewing the app only, and is _not suitable for use in actual production environments_.

---

(Click the *Source code (zip)* link down the page).

2. Extract the contents of the zip file. Then copy the contents of the `app` folder into a folder inside your document root.
For Xampp on Windows, this is usually `C:\xampp\htdocs`
(*[more info about how to find your 'document root'](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/help/z/Document_Root.html)*).

3. In your web browser, go to: `http://localhost/app-folder/`
(change `app-folder` to the name of the folder inside your document root where you extracted the zip in step 2).

4. You should now see the setup wizard in your browser. Just follow the steps!

## Customization

This application was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini). This means you can easily customize it by
opening the included AXP project file in AppGini. Examples of possible customization you can do from there include:

* [Changing the application theme](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/how-to-easily-change-your-appgini-application-theme).
* Adding more fields to existing tables, or entirely new tables to fit your use cases.
* Changing the options/behavior of any table/field in your application.
* For more details, check [the AppGini tutorials](https://bigprof.com/appgini/screencasts/).

You can also perform more advanced customization, like adding reports,
changing validation rules, adding business logic, ... etc. through hooks.

Great new for anyone interested in this project, a US appeals court has recently reaffirmed that web scraping is legal!!

https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/18/web-scraping-legal-court/amp/

I am currently a bit busy with other projects but hope to return to update it shortly.

Please get in touch if you are interested in helping me take this project forward.


## [Demo of PropertyWebScraper ](https://homestocompare.com/)

Previously there was a demo at [https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com](https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/)

I have had to take that down as heroku has cancelled thier free tier.  You can see it being used in production here though: [https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)

To use Property Web Scraper as a service you would make calls like:

[https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/retriever/as_json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightmove.co.uk%2Fproperty-for-sale%2Fproperty-68790657.html](https://real-estate-web-scraper.herokuapp.com/retriever/as_json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightmove.co.uk%2Fproperty-for-sale%2Fproperty-68790657.html)

## Support for importing properties from an MLS

PropertyWebScraper also supports connecting to different MLSs (Multiple Listing Services) in the US using RETS and Web Services.  This functionality is currently experimental and has only been implemented for 3 MLSs.  If there is a particular MLS for which you need support, open an issue with the details.   

## Rails Version

PropertyWebScraper runs with Rails >= 5.0

## Ruby Version

PropertyWebScraper runs with Ruby >= 2.0.0.

This repository contains all the code required to reproduce the results presented in the following paper:

* M. De Nadai, B. Lepri. *The economic value of neighborhoods: Predicting real estate prices from the urban environment*, 2018.

Input, intermediary and source data can be downloaded from [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6934970).

# Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file at the root of the repository. Using [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) all the required dependencies can be installed automatically.

``` sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

* [PostgreSQL 10.0](https://www.postgresql.org/) 
* [PostGIS 2.4.1](https://postgis.net) extension

# Data

Due to storage constraints, input data are not integrated to this repository. However, input and intermediary files required to run the analysis can be downloaded from a [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6934970). To run the following code, input and/or the intermediary files must be downloaded and placed in the folder. 
Then, do:

``` sh
createdb dsaa
gunzip < intermediate_db_backup.sql.gz | psql dsaa
tar -xf data.tar -C data/
```

Then place the content of dsaa_census_areas.zip into `data/generated_files/`.

To produce the intermediary files, go to the section ""DIY Instructions"".

# Code

The code of the analysis in divided in two parts: the Python scripts and modules used to support the analysis, and the notebooks where the outputs of the analysis have been produced.

## Scripts

* `data_processing_houses.ipynb` : script used for the pre-processing of Immobiliare.it data.
* `compute_walkability.py` : script used to generate the walkability scores for each census area.
* `data_processing_neighborhood.py` : script used to create all the dataset.
* `predict.py` : script used to predict the housing value from the intermediary files.
* `plots.ipynb` : script used to produce the images of the manuscript.


## License
This code is licensed under the MIT license. 


# DIY Instructions

Here we generate the entire database from ground. To do so, we have to create the minimal setup from this command:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/minimal.sql
psql dsaa < data/SQL/minimal_materialize.sql
```

## Additional dependencies
* [osm2pgsql 0.95.0-dev](https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql)
* [osrm v5.17.0](http://project-osrm.org/)
* [Security perception dependencies](https://github.com/denadai2/google_street_view_deep_neural)

## Census data
Census data have to complay to the format of the `census_areas_onfocus` table. Only when you did import data to this table you can proceed with all the steps. When you imported the data, you can generate the spatial matrix here:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/first-DIY-step.sql
```


## Walkability
A OpenStreetMap file has to be downloaded (preferably from [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm)), and placed in `data/OSM`. Then they are imported in PostGIS with:

``` sh
osm2pgsql -c -d dsaa --create --style ""config/osm2pgsql.style"" --multi-geometry --number-processes 5 --latlong -C 30000 [FILENAME].osm.pbf
```

The same file OSM file can then be used to produce the OSRM database:

``` sh
osrm-extract -p config/profiles/foot.lua [FILENAME].osm.pbf
osrm-contract [FILENAME].osrm
```

To run the server, use the command

``` sh
osrm-routed [FILENAME].osrm
```

After this everything is set up to create the intermediate data in the database. Import all the materialized view, then run the script. Before running it, personalize line 13 and 35 of `compute_walkability.py`.

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/walkability.sql
python3 compute_walkability.py
```

## Security perception
To create the security perception scores, we use the code and weights of the following paper:

* De Nadai, M., Vieriu, R. L., Zen, G., Dragicevic, S., Naik, N., Caraviello, M., ... & Lepri, B. *Are safer looking neighborhoods more lively?: A multimodal investigation into urban life*. In ACM MM 2016.

Everything is available [here](https://github.com/denadai2/google_street_view_deep_neural). All the prediction should be placed inside the `placepulse` table in PostgreSQL. Then, you can impor/refresh the materialized view present here:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/security.sql
```

## Companies
You can insert a dataset with the census areas (`geoid`) and a proxy of companies earnings (`fatturato`) in `data/companies.csv`. Pay attention that this is included only in the non-open model version.

## Land value
You can insert a dataset with the census areas (`geoid`) and a proxy of land value (`assessed_land_value`) in `data/land_value.csv`. Pay attention that this is included only in the non-open model version.

## Census
Census data has to be inserted with the same format as the files placed in `data/census` and `data/census/industry`. To change this, change the corrisponding code at `data_processing_housing.py`.

## Land use
Download satellite shapefiles from https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/urban-atlas-2012/view. Import them in the `urban_atlas` PostgreSQL table. Then run the code:

``` sh
psql dsaa < data/SQL/urban_atlas.sql
```

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/summera/retscli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/summera/retscli)

CLI for querying RETS servers and searching metadata.

This gem is built on top of the [rets](http://github.com/estately/rets) gem, which handles the actual querying and parsing of the RETS server requests. Big thanks to the [Estately](http://www.estately.com) team for their work!

![retscli gif](https://github.com/summera/gifs/blob/master/retscli/search_metadata_cropped.gif?raw=true)
![retscli png](https://github.com/summera/gifs/blob/master/retscli/search.png?raw=true)

## Installation
    $ gem install retscli

## Features
- Search metadata for keywords. Results are highlighted for readability.
- Search resources. Results are displayed in a nicely formatted ascii table.
- Open command results in your editor of choice.
- Debug RETS requests and queries in debug mode.
- Command results are paged using less by default.

## Usage

#### CLI Commands
```bash
$ retscli help
Commands:
  retscli capabilities [LOGIN URL]  # Display capabilities for rets server
  retscli console [LOGIN URL]       # Start rets console
  retscli help [COMMAND]            # Describe available commands or one specific command
  retscli validate [LOGIN URL]      # Validate rets credentials
```

To see the available flags/options, run help on the command

```bash
$ retscli help console
Usage:
  retscli console [LOGIN URL]

Options:
  -u, [--username=USERNAME]        # Username
  -p, [--password=PASSWORD]        # Password
  -v, [--version=VERSION]          # Rets version
                                   # Default: RETS/1.7.2
  -a, [--agent=AGENT]              # User agent
  -t, [--ua-password=UA_PASSWORD]  # User agent password
  -d, [--debug], [--no-debug]      # Debug mode

Start rets console
```

#### Debug Mode
To view requests being made to the RETS server, enable debug mode with the `-d` flag. Once enabled, helpful info will be logged to `$stdout`. This is helpful to debug errors thrown by the RETS server and to adjust queries.

#### Rets Console Commands
After dropping into the RETS console, you get a bunch of useful commands for searching and exploring the RETS server

```bash
$ retscli console http://rets.server.com -u summera -p password

summera@rets.server.com > help
Commands:
  capabilities                       # Display capabilities for rets server
  classes [RESOURCE]                 # List available classes for resource
  help [COMMAND]                     # Describe available commands or one specific command
  login                              # Re-Login to RETS server. Use if session is no longer valid
  metadata                           # View metadata
  objects [RESOURCE]                 # List available objects for resource
  resources                          # List available resources
  search [RESOURCE] [CLASS] [QUERY]  # Search resources, e.g. properties, open houses, etc.
  search-metadata                    # Search metadata tables
  tables [RESOURCE] [CLASS]          # List available tables for class of resource
  timezone-offset                    # System timezone offset
```

Again, to see available flags/options, run help on the command. Many of the commands have an `editor` option if you feel the need to get down and dirty in your editor of choice.


```bash
summera@rets.server.com > help search-metadata
Usage:
  search-metadata

Options:
  -r, [--resources=one two three]  # Filter metadata by resources
  -c, [--classes=one two three]    # Filter metadata by classes
  -e, [--editor=EDITOR]            # Open search results in editor

Search metadata tables
```

## Notes
- When opening output in your editor, retscli will check the `$EDITOR` environment variable. If this is not set, it falls back to nano.
- Much of the output is piped through `less` by default to allow for easy paging. If you'd like to change this, set your preferred pager in the `$PAGER` environment variable.
- Retscli uses the ruby readline module for the rets console.
- If any arguments and/or options have spaces in them, you will need to wrap them in quotes so that retscli does not split on the spaces.

Notes about JDK versions below 11
---------------------------------

JAXB is bundled with JDK 8, was disabled / deprecated in JDK 9 & 10 and finally removed in JDK 11. Therefore, we're providing JAXB as an explicit dependency. See also [""JAXB on Java 9, 10, 11 and beyond""](https://www.jesperdj.com/2018/09/30/jaxb-on-java-9-10-11-and-beyond/).

It is recommended to use this library with JDK 11 as it should work out of the box. In case you're using JDK 8, you might need to follow one of these steps documented at [""JAXB Release Documentation""](https://javaee.github.io/jaxb-v2/doc/user-guide/release-documentation.html#deployment-migrating-jaxb-2-0-applications-to-javase-6):

> JavaSE comes with JAXB 2.x API/implementation in `rt.jar`. Each version of JavaSE (6, 7, 8, ...) contains different version of JAXB 2.x API. Therefore, if you want to use different version of JAXB API/implementation than the one present in your version of JDK, you are required to override a portion of `rt.jar` with the new API. There are several ways to achieve this:
>
> 1.    Place the `jakarta.xml.bind-api-X.Y.Z.jar` into `$JRE_HOME/lib/endorsed`. **Do not put other JAXB jars into the endorsed directory.** This essentially makes your JRE to ""JRE X + JAXB 2.y"". This would affect any other applications that use this JRE, and it's easy. On the other hand, in various scenarios you may not be able to alter the JRE.
>
> 2.    Use the system property `java.endorsed.dirs` when you launch your application, and have it point to the directory which contains the `jakarta.xml.bind-api-X.Y.Z.jar` only. **The directory must not contain any other jaxb artifacts.** This allows you to use different version of JAXB for different applications.
>
> See the [endorsed directory mechanism](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/standards/) for more details.

All provided dependencies should work with JDK 8. If compatibility problems occur, you might replace them with an earlier version.

## What is ORPMS?

This nodejs project is a opensource real estate property management system. 
A web application that offers a toolkit for owners of buildings, flats, offices, meeting rooms, car parks, letter boxes...

The idea is to make easy the management of properties and occupants by proposing many services:
 - Gather all information of your properties and occupants in one place
 - Create rent contract from templates available in the system
 - Follow the rent payments month by month
 - Template letters for recovery of not paid rents

WillowTwin open digital twin definition language (DTDL) ontology for buildings and real estate

## Prerequisites

Before getting started:
* Install a code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to view, manage, and update the files.
* Install git to allow for cloning and working with this repo and its submodules. For Windows, we recommend [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
* Learn [basic git techniques](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git) such as creating a branching, committing, pulling, and pushing.
* Learn about the [Digital Twin Definition Language (DTDL)](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL//dtdlv2.md) which defines the language used to describe models of digital twins.
* Learn about the [DTDL-based RealEstateCore ontology](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building) which forms the base ontology from which this WillowTwin ontology extends.
* Learn about [Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/) which is the service WillowTwin is built upon and this ontology gets loaded into as [Models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/digital-twins/concepts-models).

## Getting Started

* Clone this repo and its submodules to your local machine by running `git clone --recurse-submodules`.

    NOTE: This project includes `git submodules` which are references to other repos. If this repo was cloned by default, such as running `git clone`, this project will only include the directories of the submodules but not the files within them yet. To initialize and pull down the submodule files, run the command: `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Read more about working with submodules [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

* After successfully cloning the submodules, there should be files in the following directories:

    | Submodule | Description |
    | --------- | ----------- |
    | DTDL-Validator | Tool to parse and validate the DTDL ontology |
    | Ontology\opendigitaltwins-building | DTDL-based RealEstateCore ontology |

* Confirm all of the DTDL files have been pulled to your local machine by running the [DTDL Validator](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/DTDL-Validator) self-contained executable. The output should include **Validated all files - Your DTDL is valid**. After making changes to the DTDL files, it is recommended to run this command prior to committing changes.

* Start browsing the Ontology which has the following top-level directories:

    | Directory | Description |
    | --------- | ----------- |
    | opendigitaltwins-building\Ontology | DTDL-based RealEstateCore ontology. This is the base set of DTDL models from which the Willow models extend |
    | Willow | This is the set of WillowTwin DTDL models which are used for creating digital twins |

    NOTE: When creating twins in the WillowTwin, they are always based on a Willow DTDL model id which begins with `dtmi:com:willowinc:`.

## Key Concepts

### Ontology Overview

A model which **extends** another model recusively inherits all of the Properties, Relationships, and Components from the referenced model. The following table describes the set of top-level models for this ontology. These form the base from which all other models extend.

| Model | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Agent | Any basic types of stakeholder that can have roles or perform activities, e.g., people, companies, departments. |
| Asset | An object such which is located inside (or outside) a building, but is not an integral part of that building's structure, for example architectural, furniture, and equipment. Assets are typically products that have a manufacturer, model, and serial number |
| Building Component | A part that constitutes a piece of a building's structural makeup, for example Facade, Wall, Slab, RoofInner, etc. These are typically constructed onsite. |
| Capability | A capability indicates the capacity of a entity, be it a Space, an Asset, or a LogicalDevice, to produce or ingest data. This is equivalent to the term ""point"" in Brick Schema and generic Building Management System. Specific subclasses specialize this behavior: Sensor entities harvest data from the real world, Actuator entities accept commands from a digital twin platform, and Parameter entities configure some capability or system. |
| Collection | An administrative grouping of entities that are addressed and treated as a unit for some purpose. These entities may have some spatial arrangement (e.g., a Tenant Unit is typically contiguous), however that is not a requirement (see, e.g., a distributed Campus consisting of spatially disjoint plots or buildings). |
| Document | A formal piece of written, printed or electronic matter that provides information or evidence or that serves as an official record, for example LeaseContract, Building Specification, Warranty, Drawing, etc. |
|Event | A spatiotemporally indexed entity with participants, something which occurs somewhere, and that has or takes some time, for example a Lease or Rent. |
| Space | A contiguous part of the physical world that has a 3D spatial extent and that contains or can contain sub-spaces. For example a Region can contain many pieces of Land, which in turn can contain many Buildings, which in turn can contain Levels and Rooms. |

NOTE: Many of the models include **Components**. These are not intended to be instantiated as digital twins. They can be thought of as a reusable interface by many models or a folder to organize a related set of Properties and Relationships.

Models define the possible set of Properties, Relationships, and Components that a twin may have; however, a twin does not have to include all of these at runtime. A twin is only required to have an **id** and a reference **model**.

### Relationships

Relationships between twins are what give the WillowTwin its powerful capabilities to action data. The more relationships that exist in for a given set of twins, also known as a greater graph density, the more opportunity there is for descriptive, presctiptive, predicitive, and real-time analtyics.

We encourage twins to be created and updated with as many relationships as possible; however, it is important that users (and machines) creating twins have a common understanding of the real-world meaning of relationships just as they should have a common understanding of the real-world meaning of models. Having this alignment allows for the highest accuracy of the analytics and thus trust in the outcomes that are actioned and surfaced by the data.

Here are the commmon relationships found in the ontology:

| Relationship | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| isPartOf | A simplified set of topological relations to connect sub- and super-entities within the top-level RealEstateCore interface tree. ""isPartOf"" operates on entities of the same type, for example Spaces have only Spaces as parts, Assets have only Assets as parts, etc. |
| isCapabilityOf | Indicates that a Space, Asset or LogicalDevice has the ability to produce or ingest data represented by sensors, actuators or parameters. |
| includedIn | Indicates that an entity is included in some Collection, for example a Building is included in a RealEstate, or an Asset is included in a System. |
| locatedIn | Indicates that a given Asset is physically located in a Space. |
| hostedBy | Indicates that a capability or logical device is hosted by another entity such as an asset. |
| servedBy | The coverage or area impacted by a given Asset or Sensor/Actuator. Note that Assets can also service one another. |
| isFedBy | Indicates that a given equipment or space is fed ""something"" by another equipment, like electricity, water or air. |
| hasDocument | Indicates that an entity has accompanying details or references in a Document such as a Drawing, Product Data, Warranty, or Lease Contract. |

Here are examples of how to use relationships:

Relationships can also have properties with all of the same semantics as properties on twins. This is an powerful feature of DTDL which allows for the graph to better model the real world. In this ontology, the **isFedBy** relationship defined on [Equipment](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-building/blob/master/Ontology/Asset/Equipment/Equipment.json), [HVACZone](https://github.com/WillowInc/opendigitaltwins-building/blob/main/Ontology/Willow/Space/Zone/HVACZone.json), and [LightingZone](https://github.com/WillowInc/opendigitaltwins-building/blob/main/Ontology/Willow/Space/Zone/LightingZone.json) has a property **substance** which defines what is being fed such as **SupplyAir**, **HotDomesticWater**, **ACElec**, or **Light**. This property has been defined as an Enum such that the allowed values for substance must come from the list defined in the above models.

NOTE: We recommend that the **substance** proeperty be defined on all **isFedBy** relationships to enable the best WillowTwin user experience. We also recommend using the most descriptive **substance** such as **SupplyAir** instead of **Air** and **SprinklerWater**instead of **Water**.

## Samples

For more in-depth examples of common scenarios, visit the [Samples](Samples).

These include diagrams and accompanying narratives to learn how to organize the data, what models should be used when creating twins, and the types of relationships between the twins.

## Frequency Asked Questions

**How do I determine which model to use when deciding between a model which extends another?**

It is recommended to be as specific as possible when creating twins to provide the most detailed classification. As such, the ""child"" model which extends the ""parent"" should always be used. For example, when creating a twin of a Fan Powered Box that is known to have a heating element, the model `dtmi:com:willowinc:FanPoweredBoxReheat;1` should be used instead of a more generic model from which it extends such as `dtmi:willowinc:TerminalUnit;1`, `dtmi:willowinc:VAVBox;1`, or `dtmi:willowinc:FanPoweredBox;1`.

**How do I determine whether to use a given relationship or its inverse?**

In general, relationships should be defined on the ""children"" twins with an outgoing relationship to a common ""parent"". For example, there are typically many rooms on a building level so the relationship would be defined as `Room-->isPartOf-->Level`. Similarly, there are many luminaires fed by an electrical circuit so the relationship would be defined as `Luminaire-->isFedBy-->ElectricalCircuit1Pole`.

## gHomes allows your players to rent/purchase houses or apartments.

GHomes is provided with strong and easy-to-use tools which will allow you to quickly add -if the map you're using is not supported yet- houses or apartments to your favorite map.

You can either buy/rent the home/apartment directly on it's front panel or go to the NPC selling them, you can also disable the panels in the config to force the players to use the Seller.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Buy houses from multiple way (Each way can be disabled in the settings/ or by not spawning the npc)

*   [**From the 2D panel like darkrp using F2**](https://youtu.be/BvZJrLRlv8c)
*   [**Or from the NPC**](https://i.imgur.com/CKlQ9zs.gif)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Let the players rent or purchase properties (You do like : max rental = 3 days, autosell after not connected after _x_ days in the config)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) Let the players decide for how much days they rent the home (You can disable each mode individually for each house)

![](https://i.imgur.com/gyO07pu.png) As a player, renew the lease before it expires

Even if the tool to add homes is easy as hell to use, [ready-to use maps files](https://i.imgur.com/7YyTCFL.png) are provided with the addon, more will come in the future, but keep in mind using [the tools](https://youtu.be/oD2ZUGqk5_M) is really easy.

All existing map are supported, there is nothing as an ""unsupported map"", the tools are easy as fuck to use, really

## Description
A scalable Python library that leverages Redfin's unofficial Stringray API to quickly scrape real estate data.

## One-Time Setup
### Zip Code Database
> A database of zip codes is required to search for City, State values  

> It is strongly recommended to download this [free](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/#) version in .csv format
### The Config
> Parameters for the RedfinScraper class can be controlled using an optional `config.json` file  

> [Sample Config](https://github.com/ryansherby/RedfinScraper/blob/main/config.json)



## Getting Started
### Installation
`pip3 install -U redfin-scraper`

### Import Module
`from redfin_scraper import RedfinScraper`  

### Initialize Module
`scraper = RedfinScraper()`

## Using The Scraper
### Required Setup
`scraper.setup(zip_database_path:str, multiprocessing:bool=False)`

> **zip_database_path**: Binary path to the zip_code_database.csv  

> **multiprocessing**: Allow for multiprocessing

### Activating The Scraper
`scraper.scrape(city_states:list[str]=None, zip_codes:list[str], sold:bool=False, sale_period:str=None, lat_tuner:float=1.5, lon_tuner:float=1.5)`
>**city_states**: List of strings representing US cities formatted as ""City, State""  

>**zip_codes**: List of strings representing US zip codes  

>**sold**: Select whether to scrape for-sale data (default) or sold data  

>**sale_period**: Must be selected whenever sold is True (1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1yr, 3yr, 5yr)

>**lat_tuner**: Represents # of standard deviations beyond the local latitude average that a zip code may exist within   

>**lon_tuner**: Represents # of standard deviations beyond the local longitude average that a zip code may exist within  

### Accessing Prior Scrapes
`scraper.get_data(id:str)`
>**id**: IDs are indexed at 1 and increase in the format ""D00#""

## Appendix
### Warnings
> Multiprocessing can result in the consumption of all available CPU resources for an extended period of time  

> Unethical use of this library can result in Redfin taking disciplinary action against your IP address  

### Recommendations
> Requests for large amounts of data (# of zip codes > 2,000) should be split into separate requests  

> The `package.log` file can be used to investigate unexpected results

<h5 align=""center""><i>real-estate data prediction & analysis</i>
</h5>
A robust application providing support for predicting and detecting land quality & cover, its optimal usage for building flats or property, its generative model and optimal paths to electric/water/sewage reserve.

# Features

- **Land Cover** : Real estate agents find it difficult to predict and determine the land quality and optimal cover.
- **External supplies** : Finding optimized path for external supplies like electricity, water or sewage reserves.
- **Optimal usage** : [COMING SOON] Optimal usage of land for predicting the maximum number of flats and bunglows possible to fit into a chosen plot.
- **Generating usages** : [UNDER EXPERIMENATION] To generate usages of the plot based on demands by the real estate agents and clients.

# Implementation

1. For classifying the land cover and usage the Resnet50 Architecture along with OpenCV's CVT Threshold.
2. For finding the land cover, semantic segmenation of Land is performed on aerial images for masking the image to suitable classes.
3. For finding the optimal and best route between two points in an aerial image we use the Djikstra Algorithm in the road segmented image of the satellite imagery with an added algorithm which ignores the region with black pixels and finds the best path among the white pixels.
4. We plan to use Generative Adverserial Networks for generating best plot plan of the chosen area for giving a complete finish plan to the real-estate agents.


### Future Plan

- Add GANs generated blueprints for construction on land site
- Dynamic Pricing model for predicting real time price predictions based on demand and availability.
- Implementing bridge with nearby sources for particular usages of tools.
- Implementing better Semantic Segmentation models for better optimal usage functionality.
- Implementing real-time deployment with added security.
- Usage of A-Star or better algorithms in finding the best optimal path between the source and reserves.

## For contributors

To install development dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install the package locally with your new code inside

```sh
pip install -e .
```

There are no unit tests or documentation currently, we're working on that.

## Integration

+ At this time, I am able to integrate with seloger.com and Google Sheets.
+ I am currently in the process of implementing support for Leboncoin.
+ If you would like me to integrate with any other third-party platforms, please submit a request in the form of an issue.
+ Additional integrations beyond seloger.com and Google Sheets are being considered and are open for request through the creation of an issue.
+ Your suggestions will be taken into consideration and evaluated for feasibility and compatibility with my current system.
+ We appreciate your feedback and suggestions as it helps us to improve and expand my capabilities to better serve you!

### You can actually write your own integration based on defaults abstract classes located at the root of the package :

- 'RealEstateService' for data acquisition
- 'ReportingService' to display and manage data
    
    
### Integration Ideas 
    
Here's few integrations ideas:

- Excel
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- ElasticSearch
- Persist data as a File (JSON, XML, CSV)
- Explorimmo
- meilleursagents.com
- apimo.net

## Context

Immoweb is the leading real estate classified ads website in Belgium. However, items disappear once they are sold or rented. If you want to be able to keep forever all the information about items (including description, photos and structured data such as PEB, bedroom count, price), you've come to the right place ! Immoweb Keeper, provided that you run it on a schedule (such as every day) and that you provide one or more search criteria, will automatically download all the new items matching those criteria and even redownload ones that were updated.

You are then free to analyse the long-term market trends, such as the evolution of price/transaction volume/average bedroom count/surface etc. in specific area over a specific time period. That part is still up to you as of today : you could use MongoDB Compass or MongoDB Charts to quickly analyse the data, use a front-end data vizualization framework to build an interactive webpage or use any other data vizualization tool.

## How to use

### Requirements

- You need to have Node.js and npm installed
- You need to have an instance of MongoDb installed on your machine

### Setup config

- Go to the root project directory using terminal & run `npm install`
- Make sure your MongoDB instance is running (you can run `mongod`)
- Modify the `config.env` file to match your MongoBD connection string, such as :
  ```sh
  MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
  MONGODB_DATABASE=immoweb
  ```
- Create a `config.json` file with the following items :
  * `imageRepository` : the path on your filesystem where you would like the items' images to be downloaded
  * `searchURLs` : just go to http://www.immoweb.be, choose you criterias and paste the url once you are on the search results page, OR :
  
  * `searchQueries` : an alternative, more structured way of storing the search criteria than the search url (the filter names are those from immoweb urls query params) 
 
  ```json
  {
    ""imageRepository"": ""~/immoweb/photos"",
    ""searchURLs"": [
        ""https://www.immoweb.be/en/search/house/for-rent?countries=BE&postalCodes=BE-1140&orderBy=relevance"",
        ""https://www.immoweb.be/en/search/apartment/for-rent?countries=BE&minBedroomCount=1&propertySubtypes=KOT%2CFLAT_STUDIO&page=1&orderBy=relevance""
    ],
    ""searchQueries"": [{
            ""propertyTypes"": [""HOUSE""],
            ""postalCodes"": [1030, 1040, 1140],
            ""maxPrice"": 600000,
            ""minBedroomCount"": 3
        }, {
            ""propertyTypes"": [""GARAGE""],
            ""postalCodes"": [1030, 1040, 1140]
        }]
  }
  ```

### Run download routine

Execute `npm run routine` to start the download routine.

Ideally, you should setup a cron job to execute the routine daily (there are various ways of achieving this depending on your OS).

All the structured data and the pictures will be respectively stored in your MongoDB database and on your hard drive.

Then, it's up to you to decide how you want to xplore : you can use the front-end described in next section to explore the results, or you can setup any data vizualisation tool.

It is good to know that :
- The first time you include a search query/url in the config and run Immoweb Keeper, it will browse through all search results matching that criteria
- The next times, Immoweb Keeper will sort the results from the most recently to the least recently updated item, and stop browsing the results when it reaches an item that has not been updated since the last time you runned Immoweb Keeper

### Run visualisation page

- Execute ``npm run server`` to setup the server that will expose the data from your MongoDB
  * if you want to use another port than 5000, you can override the default port in ``config.env``

- Execute ``npm run client`` and the React ImmowebKeeper website will pop up in your default browser and allow you to explore the results !
  * use the filters on top to dive into your results
  * currently, the filtering is done on all the results that exist in your database, no distinction is made between the different search queries
  * lots of improvements and optimizations yet to come !

## Data model

If the provided front-end is a bit light for your needs, you are free to explore the data with any tool you want. Here is a documentation of how the data is structured in the MongoDB database :

### Collection `estates`

|       Field         |            Source             |                      Description                    |

| _id                 | MongoDB                       | unique id generated by mongodb                      |
| rawMetada           | Immoweb                       | all the raw metadata as it was fetched from Immoweb |
| fetchDate           | Immoweb Keeper                | datetime of the download                            |
| images              | Immoweb Keeper                | item's pictures file paths on your hard drive       |
| lastSeen            | Immoweb Keeper                | date of last run in which that item appeared        |
| disappearanceDate   | Immoweb Keeper                | date of first run in which it was not there anymore |
| immowebCode         | rawMetadata                   | unique id within immoweb                            |
| lastModificationDate| rawMetadata                   | cast to datetime                                    |
| creationDate        | rawMetadata                   | cast to datetime                                    |
| expirationDate      | rawMetadata                   | cast to datetime                                    |
| geolocation         | rawMetadata.property.location | better format for direct display in MongoDB compass |

#### Subdocument `rawMetadata`

Whereas the first level structure is guaranteed by Immoweb Keeper, the *rawMetadata* field structure could change without notice in the case of Immoweb changing things in their data structure. Only a change in the lastModificationDate and id (which holds the immoweb code) would break the Immoweb Keeper routine as it uses them for indexing data and knowing when to stop to browse results. Any other modification in the structure would just make the afterhand data analysis more difficult.

## How does it work ?

- All the structured data about real estate items will be stored in your **immoweb** MongoDB database (in collections **estates**)
- All the item pictures will be downloaded to your image repository folder, in subfolders named after their immoweb codes
- The details (url, list of criteria, last run date) of the search query will be stored as documents the *queries* collection of the *immoweb* database, along with the last time when it was runned

Here is the overview of how the code is organized. When you run it, the script will :

- Create a database called *immoweb* in your mongodb instance specified in *mongoDBUrl* (if it does not exist already)
- Create the folder for the image repository as mentioned in *imageRepository* (if it does not exist already)
- For each of your search result's URLs or structured queries, it will then :
  - Get the last run date from the *queries* collection of the *immoweb* mongodb
  - Add a filter to sort results from the most to the least recently updated/created
  - For each page of results, it will extract all the immoweb codes and for each of them, it will :
    - Get the JSON metadata provided by immoweb in the source code of the item webpage
    - Get the lastModificationDate from the metadata : if it is older than the last run date of this query, go on with the next query
    - Get all the item's pictures' urls from the media.pictures item from the metadata
    - Download all pictures to the path *<imageRepository>/<immowebCode>/<pictureName>.jpg*
    - Create a new document in the *estate* collection of the *immoweb* database with the immoweb metadata wrapped with other data (cf next section)
  - Save the current date and time as the last run date for that query in the *query* collection of the *immoweb* database

## Work in progress...

The download routine is working fully, but the front-end visualization page, although working, is still under construction : only a few filters exist, the retrieval of items from the database is far from efficient and there is no way to select for which query we want to see the results : the filters work on the basis of the full set of data and their min/max/allowed values (price range, list of zip codes) does not change according to the bounds that we can find in the database.",20,20,4,28,real-estate,"[immoweb, mongodb, nodejs, real-estate, scraper]",00000

Movin' In is a Rental Property Management Platform with a backend for managing properties, customers and bookings, a frontend and a mobile app for renting properties.

Movin' In is designed to work with multiple agencies. Agencies can manage their properties and bookings from the backend. Movin' In can also work with only one agency as well.

From the backend, administrators can create and manage agencies, properties, locations, users and bookings.

When new agencies are created, they receive an email prompting them to create their account to access the backend and manage their properties, customers and bookings.

Customers can sign up from the frontend or the mobile app, search for available properties based on location point and time, choose a property and complete the checkout process.

A key design decision was made to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript due to its numerous advantages. TypeScript offers strong typing, tooling, and integration, resulting in high-quality, scalable, more readable and maintainable code that is easy to debug and test.

<img src=""https://movin-in.github.io/content/docker.png"" alt="""" width=""220"" />

Movin' In can run in a Docker container. Follow this step by step [guide](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki/Docker) to walk you through on how to build Movin' In Docker image and run it in a Docker container.

Python wrapper and scraper for the Realtor.ca website. Use it to scrape Canadian real-estate listings easily.

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the package requirements.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/harry-s-grewal/mls-real-estate-scraper-for-realtor.ca.git
```

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harry-s-grewal/mls-real-estate-scraper-for-realtor.ca.git
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ./mls-real-estate-scraper-for-realtor.ca/requirements.txt
```

## Context
Realtor.ca has two API endpoints: `PropertySearch_Post` and `PropertyDetails`. Querying `PropertySearch_Post` 
will return a list of properties in a .json format, including some limited details. Querying `PropertyDetails` will provide detailed information on each property. Depending on what you're looking for, you can query one or the other, but be aware that getting details on each property is slow. That's because Realtor.ca is rate limited (boo). If you make too many queries too often, you'll receive an `Error 403: Unauthorized` error. It's not clear what the rate limit is, but waiting an hour or so between limits stops the freeze-out.

## Usage
In `queries.py` you will find queries to Realtor.ca for both the `PropertySearch_Post` endpoint and the `PropertyDetails` endpoint. It also contains a query to get the coordinate bounding box of a city, as that's what Realtor.ca uses to determine which properties to list.

In `realtorca.py` there are two functions to automate the scraping of Realtor.ca.

`get_property_list_by_city()` will scrape a list of properties by city and save it as a .csv.
```python
get_property_list_by_city(""Calgary, AB"")
```

Result:
```bash
CalgaryAB.csv
```
`get_property_details_from_csv()` will use that .csv file to get property listing details to enhance the data already available.
```python
get_property_list_by_city(""CalgaryAB.csv"")
```

Homemix - A Real Estate API (This project is still a work in progress).
========

Homemix is a RESTful API that enables users to buy and sell properties with ease. It provides endpoints for CRUD operations on real estate listings, making it simple for users to create, read, update, and delete listings.

- URL: https://homemix-api.onrender.com
- Documentaion - https://homemix-api.onrender.com/redoc/


Features Explained
------------------

With Homemix, users can list properties with detailed information, including property type, address, price, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, description, photos, availability, and contact information. This makes it easy for potential buyers to search for properties that meet their specific needs and requirements.

Homemix also provides advanced search and filtering capabilities, allowing users to search for properties based on parameters such as location, price, number of bedrooms, and more. The API supports pagination for large datasets, with customizable page size and page number parameters, making it easy to view large amounts of data.

Users can register as either a buyer or seller and are provided with secure authentication and authorization through the use of token-based authentication. This ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive information and the ability to manipulate data.

Homemix is built with Django Rest Framework (DRF), a powerful and flexible framework for building APIs in Django. This makes it easy to extend and customize the API to meet specific needs, and provides comprehensive documentation and examples to get you started quickly.

With its advanced search and filtering capabilities, secure authentication, and support for multiple media types, Homemix is the ideal solution for anyone looking to buy or sell properties with ease.

In addition to the features mentioned above, Homemix now also includes a referral system. Users can generate a unique referral code and share it with their friends or family. When a new user signs up using the referral code, both the referring user and the new user receive a reward or incentive.

Users can view a list of all the users they have referred, providing transparency and accountability. This encourages existing users to invite others to the platform and helps to grow the user base.

Overall, Homemix offers a comprehensive solution for buying and selling properties, with a user-friendly interface and advanced features to make the process as smooth and efficient as possible.


Why Homemix?
--------

The creation of Homemix is a personal project for me as it has roots in my family's background in the real estate industry. Growing up, my parents ran a traditional real estate business and I have always wanted to create something that would solve some of the problems they faced and make their work easier.

I saw an opportunity to use my skills in software development to build an API that would streamline the process of buying and selling properties. With Homemix, I aim to provide users with an intuitive and user-friendly platform that makes it easy to list properties and search for properties that meet their needs.

The project holds a special place in my heart because it allows me to give back to my parents and the real estate community. I am passionate about creating a clean, well-secured API that will make a positive impact on the industry. I believe that the features and capabilities offered by Homemix will greatly benefit both buyers and sellers, and I am excited to see the impact it will have.

In short, Homemix is a project that brings together my passion for real estate and my skills in software development. I am confident that it will make a positive difference in the industry and I look forward to seeing it grow and evolve over time.

Installation
------------

Here are the steps to install and set up the Homemix real estate API project locally:

1. Clone the repository: First, you will need to clone the Homemix repository to your local machine. This can be done using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/homemix.git
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment: It is recommended to work with a virtual environment to keep the dependencies for this project separate from other projects on your system. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m venv homemix-env
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
    ```bash
    source homemix-env/bin/activate (for Mac or Linux)
    ```

    ```bash
    source homemix-env\Scripts\activate (for Windows)
    ```
3. Install dependencies: Next, you will need to install the dependencies required for the project. These dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Set up the database: The Homemix API uses the Django ORM to interact with a database. By default, the project uses PostgreSQL as the database or you could use any database of your choice. Run these commands to make migrations:
     ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
  
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
5. Create a superuser: To access the Django admin interface, you will need to create a superuser. You can do this by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
6. Run the development server: Once the installation and setup are complete, you can start the development server by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  
  The Homemix API should now be running at http://localhost:8000/. You can access the Django admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin/.
  
  
Running Unit Tests

After making any changes to the code, it's important to run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
2. Enter the following command to run the tests:

     ```bash
    python manage.py tests
    ```
3. Wait for the tests to complete. If any tests fail, you will see an error message in the terminal.
4. Make sure that all tests are passing before pushing any changes to the codebase.

### <span style=""color:red"">_This component requires HA Core version 2021.6.0 or greater!_</span>

This is a _Custom Integration_ for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It uses the unofficial [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com) API to get property value estimates.

There currently is support for the Sensor device type within Home Assistant.

## Installation

### HACS installation

This Integration is part of the default HACS store, so go to the HACS page and search for _Redfin_.

### Manual Installation

To manually add Redfin to your installation, create this folder structure in your /config directory:

`custom_components/redfin`.

Then drop the following files into that folder:

```yaml
translations/en.json
__init__.py
config_flow.py
const.py
hacs.json
sensor.py
manifest.json
```

## Configuration

You will need the Redfin property ID for each property you‚Äôd like to track. This information is available from the URL of a property you are interested in. If you‚Äôre the owner of this property, it‚Äôs recommended to claim the listing and update the property information to help the information be as accurate as possible.

For example, given this Redfin URL: https://www.redfin.com/DC/Washington/1745-Q-St-NW-20009/unit-3/home/9860590 the property ID is 9860590.

To enable this sensor, add new Redfin integration component in the Home Assistant UI and follow the prompts to add your properties.

The sensor provides the following attributes:

- amount
- amount_currency
- amount_formatted
- address
- full_address
- redfin_url
- street_view

51,flatcrawl-processors,floschnell,N/A,https://github.com/floschnell/flatcrawl-processors,https://api.github.com/repos/floschnell/flatcrawl-processors,A set of processors that will instantly inform users via a set of channels (ie. Telegram) of new flats that are found on different rental websites.,"# flatcrawl-processors

This repository is part of my **flatcrawl project**. The processors will receive new flats from the message broker (ie. RabbitMQ). They will then evaluate the flats against the user defined searches and send them notifications on different channels (ie. Telegram), when they have a match.

If you are interested in how the flats end up at the message broker: there's [another repository that contains the different crawlers](https://github.com/floschnell/flatcrawl-crawlers) which will extract the flat information from the different rental portals and then sends them to the message broker's queue.

## The flatcrawl project

The purpose of the project is to **collect flats from different rental sites** and **expose them in a consistent shape**. Eventually it lets users define **custom searches** and provides them with **instant updates on new matching flats**.

**Clarification**: flats are *not* stored on the server. The purpose is not to create a competing portal, but to extend usability and help users find the right flat quickly by receiving updates from several sites without the hassle to setup and maintain different searches.

## Usage

This chapter describes how to use the flatcrawler. Only thing that you will need is the [Telegram App](https://telegram.org/) on either your smartphone, your computer or any other supported device.

### Create a Search

To create a search, you need to get in touch with the FlatCrawl bot. You can search for it and communicate with it like with any other contact in Telegram.
Use the app's search field and look for *FlatcrawlBot*. Once found, click onto it and hit the Start button to begin a conversation.

Right now the bot is capable of a few commands that you can simply type into the conversation window. To start a search, simply type `/search`. Afterwards the bot will ask you some questions and eventually keep looking for flats that match your criteria.

<p align=""center"">
<img alt=""An Example Conversation with the Flat Crawling Bot"" src=""./img/conversation.png"" />
</p>

Once the search is setup, the bot will output an numeric ID. Remember it well. The bot will not start to send flats right away! This is because you might want to be notified within a group, so that all your potential flat mates receive the offers as well. This is very helpful, because all members of the group will then be able to discuss the different flats just as they are popping in.

### Subscribe to a Search

To continuously receive new flats that match your search criteria, first go to the chat or group conversation where you would like to be notified. Then open the chat menu and add a new member. Search and choose the *FlatcrawlBot*.

Then, back in the chat, you just need to enter `/subscribe [ID]`. Of course, you will need to replace [ID] with the ID that the bot provided you with, when you finished the search setup.

That's it, now you will receive all the new flats that get posted on all the different web portals if they only match your search criteria.

## Development

This project consists of two parts:
- **Firebase Realtime Database:** Stores users and their configured searches.
- **Telegram Processor:** Client application that will listen for new events on the queue. As soon as a new flat becomes available it will check all user searches and send out messages whenever matches have been found.

Of those **only the telegram client is under source control**. However, if you setup a firebase account and create an empty database, it will then be filled automatically as soon as you run the crawling application.

### Setup
If you want to run the whole infrastructure yourself, you will need to do the following things:
1) Create a [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/) and setup an empty realtime database.
2) [Create a Telegram bot via the BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot).
3) Create a Google API Key for the Directions API
4) Create the `src/config.ts` file and fill it with the information you should have acquired from step 1, 2 and 3:
```typescript
// from step 1
export const DATABASE_KEY = '...';
export const DATABASE_URL = '...';
// from step 2
export const BOT_ID = '...';
export const BOT_TOKEN = '...:...';
// from step 3
export const GOOGLE_API_KEY = '...';
```
5) Finally - for the webhooks to work - you will also need to create a self signed SSL certificate like so:
```bash
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout ./certs/private.key -x509 -days 365 -out ./certs/public.pem -subj ""/C=DE/ST=Bavaria/L=Munich/O=/CN=YOURDOMAIN.EXAMPLE""
```
You will need to replace YOURDOMAIN.EXAMPLE with the public domain via that the bot can be found.

### Build
Before you can build the code, you need to install all dependencies:
```
yarn install
```
After that, you can run
```
yarn build
```
which will compile all Typescript files and put them in a folder called `dist/`.

### Run
Once you have completed the setup and build steps, you can run all processors by
```
yarn start

[See more](https://www.espocrm.com/extensions/real-estate/) on the website.

## Configuration

Create `config.json` file in the root directory. When reading, this config will be merged with `config-default.json`. You can override default parameters in the created config.

Parameters:

* espocrm.repository - from what repository to fetch EspoCRM;
* espocrm.branch - what branch to fetch (`stable` is set by default); you can specify version number instead (e.g. `5.8.5`);
* database - credentials of the dev database;
* install.siteUrl - site url of the dev instance.


## Config for EspoCRM instance

You can override EspoCRM config. Create `config.php` in the root directory of the repository. This file will be applied after EspoCRM intallation (when building).

Example:

```php
<?php
return [
    'useCacheInDeveloperMode' => true,
];
```

## Building

After building, EspoCRM instance with installed extension will be available at `site` directory. You will be able to access it with credentials:

* Username: admin
* Password: 1

Note: You can build on Linux and Windows OS. Commands are the same.

### Preparation

1. You need to have *node*, *npm*, *composer* installed.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Create a database. The database name is set in the config file.

### Full EspoCRM instance building

It will download EspoCRM (from the repository specified in the config), then build and install it. Then it will install the extension.

Command:

```
node build --all
```

Note: It will remove a previously installed EspoCRM instance, but keep the database intact.

### Extension package building

Command:

```
node build --extension
```

The package will be created in `build` directory.

Note: The version number is taken from `package.json`.

## Development workflow

1. Do development in `src` dir.
2. Run `node build --copy`.
3. Test changes in EspoCRM instance at `site` dir by opening it in a browser. A URL will look like: `http://localhost/real-estate/site`, depending on how you named your directory.

## Tests

Prepare:

1. `node build --copy`
2. `cd site`
3. `grunt test`

Unit tests:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=./vendor/autoload.php tests/unit/Espo/Modules/RealEstate
```

Integration tests:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap=./vendor/autoload.php tests/integration/Espo/Modules/RealEstate
```

## Versioning

The version number is stored in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

Bumping version:

```
npm version patch
npm version minor
npm version major
```

## Translation

Assuming that you have already built EspoCRM instance.

### Building PO file

1. Change dir: `cd site`
2. Run: `node po en_US --module=RealEstate` (replace `en_US` with a language code you need to translate to)

This will generate PO file in `site/build/` directory. You will need to translate this file.

### Building langauge files from PO

Assuming you have translated PO file in build directory with the same name as when it was generated.

1. Change dir: `cd site`
2. Run: `node lang en_US --module=RealEstate` (replace `en_US` with the target language code)

This will generate language files in `site/build/` directory. You will need to copy these files to `src/files/` directory and commit.

## Overview

Manifold is a plug-and-play end-to-end real estate asset tracker. In other words, it encompasses the entire process of tracking real estate listings in a variety of sources (e.g. ERA, REMAX), from website scraping to the ETL process, culminating in a Data Warehouse (Kimball). Typically, Real Estate market studies are expensive or performed by external platforms. Manifold's goal is to provide everyone with the capability to track their local Real Estate market with little effort, and virtually no expenses.

The project is built on top of different languages and platforms:
* Scrapers
  * [GoLang] - Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency making it a performant candidate for web scraping
  * [Python] (deprecated)
* ETL
  *  [Apache Airflow] - Apache Airflow is an open-source workflow management platform
  *  [Apache Spark] - Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing
  *  [AWS EMR] - Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is a tool for big data processing and analysis on Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink, Apache Hudi, and Presto
  *  [AWS Redshift] - Amazon Redshift is a data warehouse product that forms part of the larger cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services
  *  [AWS S3] - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance
  


## Features

- Fast web scrapers ([GoLang Colly])
- Scalable ETL ([Apache Spark], [AWS EMR], [AWS S3], [AWS Redshift])
- Pre-built ETL DAG ([Apache Airflow])
- Backfill - only the resources for the current timestep are consumed (*default* weekly)
- Extensible
- Cheap - resources are allocated and deallocated on a need basis

## Structure

The project is divided into two main categories: web scrapers (crawlers) and ETL resources.

| Folder | Category | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| crawler | Crawlers | Go and Python (deprecated) web scrapers |
| dags | ETL | Apache Airflow DAGs |
| plugins | ETL | Apache Airflow extensions (Operators, Sensors, utilities) |
| scripts | ETL | Python and Bash scripts to be stored and executed by third parties (Apache Spark, AWS EMR) |
| images | miscellaneous | Documentation support images |


## ETL Process

The ETL process consists of five interlinked and linear steps:
1. Web scraping ([GoLang] by default)
2. Intermmediate layer - source consumption and staging preparation in Parquet format ([Apache Spark], [AWS EMR], [AWS S3])
3. Staging layer- Parquet to AWS Redshift ([AWS Redshift], [AWS S3])
4. Presentation layer - presentation layer creation with Slowly Changing Dimensions (type 2)

Note: The scrapers were not included in the DAG given different users will aim at executing them in different manners (locally, docker, Kubernetes) hence, a dummy operator replaces the scrapers by default.

![DAG](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/graph.PNG)

### Data Model

The data model is comprised of four dimensions and one fact table:

| Object Name| Object Type| SCD Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |  ------ |
| dim_asset| Dimension| SCD2 | The unique asset dimension |
| dim_broker | Dimension| SCD2 | The unique broker dimension |
| dim_geography | Dimension| SCD2 | The unique grography (country, district, county, parish) dimension|
| dim_date_view | Dimension| SCD2 | The unique date dimension (note: the object is a view which might need reparametrization) |
| fact_stock| Fact| None | Holds the stock (assets) present at a given time step |

![DAG](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/data_model.PNG)

Note: for future work, it's worth considering adding three additional fact tables:
* fact_new_stock - represents assets not present in the previous date's stock
* fact_deleted_stock - represents assets no longer present relative to the previous date's stock
* fact_price_oscillations - represents assets that suffered a price oscillation relative to the previous date's stock

### Intermmediate layer
![EMR Create](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/emr_create.png)

Launches an EMR (*default* cluster) instance, which installs the required packages using [scripts/bootstrap_install_python_modules.sh], and runs the [Apache Spark] ETL process via [scripts/el_to_parquet.py]. 

[scripts/el_to_parquet.py] in in charge of the following tasks:
- locating the S3 bucket for the referenced timestep (*default* weekly)
- consuming the identified JSON sources
- cleanup and standardization
- staging layer creation (Parquet files)
- save Parquet files to an S3 bucket

### Staging layer

The staging layer is in charge of consuming the [AWS S3] Parquet files into [AWS Redshift]. The process is handled by the S3 to Redshift Operator.

The DAG is then comprised of two steps:

1- Assert the existence of the proper schemas, and create them if not present
![Schema Create](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/staging_schema.png)
2- Copy the Parquet files into the appropriate dimensional object
![Staging Copy](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/staging_tables.png)

### Presentation layer

The presentation or consumption layer holds the final updated dimensional model. Roughly speaking, the layer's responsibilities are:
1- Calculate dimension Deltas
2- Upsert dimension data according to the computed Delta
![Presentation Dimension](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/presentation_dimensions.png)
3- Append to the fact tables
![Presentation Fact](https://github.com/Guilherme-B/manifold/blob/main/images/dag/presentation_facts.png)

Operations 1 and 2 are the responsibility of the [Dimension Operator], whereas the Fact appending is handled via Postgres Operator.

## Custom Operators

Two operators were introduced to facilitate and replicate Airflow functions:
- [Dimension Operator]
- [S3 to Redshift Operator]

### Dimension Operator

The [Dimension Operator] computes the Deltas between a *base_table* and *target_table*, by comparing the *(SHA256) hash* between the two tables (typically, staging vs presentation), using *match_columns* as the business keys, and updates the *target_table* by implementing a Slowly Changing Dimension of type 2.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| postgres_conn_id | str | The Airflow Redshift connection ID |
| target_table | str | The table to be updated (typically, presentation) |
| base_table | str | The base table to use as current value (typically, staging) |
| match_columns | List[str] | The list of columns representing business keys |
| database_name | str | The target database (*default dev*) |

### S3 to Redshift Operator

The [S3 to Redshift Operator] is responsible for taking a set of Parquet files stored in an [AWS S3] bucket and pushing them to the defined [AWS Redshift] cluster.


| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| redshift_conn_id | str | The Airflow Redshift connection ID |
| redshift_credentials_id | str | The Airflow connection containing the Redshift credentials |
| s3_path | str | The base [AWS S3] URL holding the Parquet files |
| s3_bucket_template | str | The template S3 Bucket template (for backfilling, *default ""/{year}/{month}/{week}/""* |
| destination_name | str | The [AWS Redshift] destination table name |
| source_name | str | The Parquet file name |
| role_name | str | The [AWS Redshift] role name |
| region_name | str | The [AWS Redshift] cluster region |

### Data Quality - Count Operator

The [Data Quality - Count Operator] implements a basic data quality layer, asserting whether or not a table contains records.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| postgres_conn_id | str | The Airflow Postgres connection ID |
| table_name | str | The Postgres/Redshift table name |

### Data Quality - Dimension Operator

The [Data Quality - Dimension Operator] is responsible for checking if a dimension contains multiple active records, in other words, if the Slowly Changing Dimension type 2 failed to process appropriately.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |
| postgres_conn_id | str | The Airflow Postgres connection ID |
| table_name | str | The Postgres/Redshift table name |
| identification_columns | List[str] | The unique columns (e.g. contract_number for dim_asset, broker_name for dim_broker) to serve as business keys |

## Sources

Manifold comes with two out-of-the-box scrapers: one developed in GoLang, two developed in Python (deprecated). However, given the small number of local listings per website (around 10.000), Manifold has been tested on 50 million records of weekly data, in addition to the weekly scraped listings. 

External data sources:
* [Argentina Data]
* [Colombia Data]
* [Ecuador Data]
* [Uruguay Data]
* [Peru Data]
* [Brazil Data]
* [Spain (Madrid) Data]
* [Mexico Data]

The data was then aggregated, and a 10-week weekly evolution was simulated: in each week, a sample of 80% of the dataset was retrieved, simulating new and removed assets; in addition to price fluctuations.

The final dataset contained around 50GB of data.

## Installation

Manifold is a plug-and-play project, which is fully working from the moment [Apache Airflow] is started. Nonetheless, there are configurations that need to be set and connections to be created in order to drive the DAG and make sure it's pointing in the right direction, with the appropriate permissions. 

### Configuration
#### Variables
| Variable Name | Description |
| ------ |  ------ |
| manifold_s3_path |  The [AWS S3] base bucket name |
| manifold_s3_template |  The template S3 Bucket template (for backfilling, *default ""/{year}/{month}/{week}/""* |

#### Connections
| Connection Name | Type | Description | Extra |
| ------ | ------ |  ------ |   ------ |
| aws_credentials | Amazon Web Services | The AWS  ([AWS S3]) login (Access Key) and password (Secret Access Key)  | {""region_name"": ""your_region_name""} | 
| emr_credentials | Amazon Web Services | The [AWS EMR] login (Access Key) and password (Secret Access Key) | |
| redshift_conn | Postgres | The [AWS Redshift] connection details, host, schema, login, password, port | |

### Docker

Apache Spark can be started by using docker-compose on the provided image, which takes care of the entire process including the first-time setup:
```sh
cd manifold
docker-compose up -d
```

Reinventing and revolutionizing the real estate space w blockchain üåç

Virtual Ownership

- Buy, sell, rent, and lease real estate land on the blockchain
- Fractional ownership of land (Dividing the land into fractions and enabling trading)
- Blockchain facilitates secure data sharing, streamlines rental collections and payments to property owners

Land Transfer

Land titles continue to rely on paper documentation, vulnerable to loss, fraud, and mismanagement

- Blockchain replaces outdated paper deeds with true digital assets
- Tracks changes on an immutable ledger that acts as a secure shared source of truth for documents between multiple parties and organizations.
- Ethereum enables transaction and property ownership records to be more accessible
- Facilitating market transactions, increasing investor confidence, unlocking access to finance, and promoting economic and social community development

Buyer focused property search, with results tailored to your needs rather than the agents.

## How to Build & Deploy the API

Assumes you have:

- An AWS Account including access & secret keys
- Domain client ID & secret, available from [Domain](https://developer.domain.com.au/docs/introduction) 
- A Google maps API key
- WalkScore API key, available from [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/walk-score-apis.php)

1.  Build Domain client library

```sh
sh build_domain_client_library.sh
```

2.  Copy contents to `src`

```sh
mv domainClient/domainClient src/domainClient
```

3.  Install & configure serverless via the instructions on their [website](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/)

4. Populate `serverless.yml` with all required keys


5.  To deploy:

```sh
sls deploy
```


6.  Once done, teardown the infrastructure using:

```sh
sls remove
```

## Using the API

An API will now be available that you can query with different search parameters. 

To query the API make a `POST` request using your favourite client & include a `JSON` body with your search & filter criteria. The key items to include are:

-   `Domain` [residential search](https://developer.domain.com.au/docs/latest/apis/pkg_agents_listings/references/listings_detailedresidentialsearch)
-   `Filters` are (optional) additional parameters to filter the results


Currently the supported filters are:
* `travelTime`
    - A desired destination & the maximum allowable public transport time to get there
* `features`
    - List of features the property must have:
        - AirConditioning
        - Heating
        - Outside
        - Dishwasher
    - Also see `src/filter_parameters.yml`
* `nbn`
    - List of desired NBN types from [NBN technologies](https://www.nbnco.com.au/learn/network-technology)
* `walkscore`
    - Minimum allowable walkscore value, as defined by [Walk Score](https://www.walkscore.com/)


Full deatils or requests & the acceptable parameters are available in `search_schema.json`


A request will look like:

```json
{
    ""domain"":{
        // as per domain docs
    },
    ""filters"":{
        ""travelTime"": {
            ""destinationAddress"": ""<target destination>"",
            ""maxTravelTime"": 10 //minutes
        },
        ""features"":[""<keys from feature_parameters.yml>"", ],
        ""nbn"": [""<list of nbn types>""],
        ""walkscore"": <minimum allowable walkscore>
    }
}
```

Eg:

```json
{
    ""domain"": {
        ""listingType"": ""Sale"",
        ""propertyTypes"": [""Penthouse"",""ApartmentUnitFlat""],
        ""minBedrooms"": 4,

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

With the functions from this repository you can create your personal
database of property offers from the Sreality website, update their
status and analyse their history. You need some knowledge of R to do
this.

## How to use

1.  Clone this repo, or create a new project in RStudio and copy the R
    folder.
2.  Create subfolders `data` and `images`.

### Load packages and functions

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

source(""R/sreality-funcs.R"")
```

### Add property

Adds the property with the given URL to the `data/my_properties.rds`
file. If you specify the `img_dir` parameter, a small preview image is
downloaded and saved in this folder under the name *id\_property.jpg*

If a property with the given id already exists in the file, an error
will occur.

``` r
add_property(
  data_path = ""data/my_properties.rds"",
  img_dir = ""images/"",
  url = ""https://www.sreality.cz/detail/prodej/dum/rodinny/melnik-melnik-namesti-miru/3960968780""
)
#> Warning in add_property(data_path = ""data/my_properties.rds"", img_dir =

```

Adds multiple properties to the `data/my_properties.rds` file. If any
property id already exists in the file, an error will occur.

``` r
add_property(
  data_path = ""data/my_properties.rds"",
  img_dir = ""images/"",

#> # ‚Ä¶ with 4 more variables: price_0 <dbl>, price_last <dbl>, description <chr>,
#> #   url <chr>
```

You can filter the previous dataframe by status (only valid: `status
%in% c(""init"", ""live"")` or only removed: `status == ""gone""`), by price
change (`price_last != price_0`), etc.

#### List of properties using the {gt} package

``` r
list_properies(""data/my_properties.rds"") |> 
  mutate(
    name = paste0(""["", name, ""]("", url, "")""),
    name = map(name, gt::md)
  ) |> 
  select(name, location, price_last) |> 
  gt::gt() |> 
  gt::cols_label(price_last = ""price"") |> 
  gt::fmt_number(price_last, decimals = 0, suffixing = ""K"") |>

<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
During the Wanxiang Blockchain Hackathon in Shanghai, we made a model to tokenize office space. Instead of expansive and insecure Agents selling office space we have build an smart contracts with embedded KYC and whitelist that will enable a more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have it's own ERC20 token and then each floor will have its own ERC721 to separate ownership, better control of open space and easy budget management.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wp-api-libraries/wp-idxbroker-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wp-api-libraries/wp-idxbroker-api)

# Example Usage
The IDX Broker API library contains a method for each endpoint of the API. Visit the [PHPDocs](https://wp-api-libraries.github.io/wp-idxbroker-api/classes/IdxBrokerAPI.html) for the full documentation.

#### GET Requests
```php
$idx_api = new IdxBrokerAPI( 'example_api_key' );

$res1 = $idx_api->get_clients_featured();

$res2 = $idx_api->get_clients_systemlinks( 'url' );

$res3 = $idx_api->get_mls_approvedmls();
```

#### POST Requests
```php
$res1 = $idx_api->post_clients_dynamicwrapperurl( 'https://example.com/luxury-real-estate', '12345' );

$data = array( 'note' => 'Wheres my IDX?' );
$res2 = $idx_api->post_leads_note( '3', '1', $data );

```

#### PUT Requests
```php
$data = array( 
  'propertyName' => 'Test Property',
  'property' => array('idxID' => 'a001', 'listingID' => '345678' )
);
$res1 = $idx_api->put_leads_property( 812, $data );
```

#### DELETE Requests
```php
$res1 = $idx_api->delete_clients_supplemental( 345678 );
```

## Helper Methods

The library also provides a few methods that assist in  extracting  information that is not readily accessible.

#### Check API Key Usage
After you make a call to the API you can check your hourly API key usage using the check_usage method
```php
$usage = $idx_api->check_usage();
```

#### Get Wrapper Domain
The API doesnt have an easy way of getting the domain used on the client wrapper pages. The domain can be some version of either `<youraccount>.idxbroker.com` or `<customsubdomain>.<yourdomain>.com`
```php
$domain = $idx_api->get_idx_domain();

/*
Results
Array
(
    [scheme] => https
    [url] => search.example.com
    [full] => https://search.example.com
)
*/
```

## Extending Functionality

The IDXBrokerAPI Class is extensible, which gives developers the ability to override the functionality of the class to their needs.

For Example. Exceeding the hourly limit is a common issue developers may face when using the API. By overriding the `request()` method, we can cache the calls made to the API.
```php
class OptimizedIdxBrokerAPI extends IdxBrokerAPI {

  /**
   * By overriding the request method we can intercept the API call and choose to 
   * either make a fresh API call or retrieve a cached result from the database.
   */
  public function request( $force_refresh = false ) {
    // Only cache GET requests.
    if ( 'GET' !== $this->args['method'] ) {
      return parent::request();
    }

    // We md5 the route to create a unique key for that call and to also reduce the risk of
    // creating a key that is over 64 characters long, aka the max length for option names.
    $transient_key = 'idxbroker_cache_' . md5( $this->route );

    // Check if cached results for API call exist.
    $request = get_transient( $transient_key );

    // If nothing is found, make the request.
    if ( true === $force_refresh || false === $request ) {
      // Parent method handles the request to IDX Broker.
      $request = parent::request();

      if ( false !== $request ) {
        set_transient( $transient_key, $request, 1 * HOUR_IN_SECONDS );
      }
    }
		
    return $request;
  }
	
}
```
Now when you instantiate your new class and make calls to methods such as `get_clients_featured()` or `get_partners_clients()`, you will get cached versions of the results if they are available.

##### Usage:
```php
$optimized_idx_api = new OptimizedIdxBrokerAPI( 'yourapikey' );

$results = $optimized_idx_api->get_clients_featured(); // Fresh call to the API.

$results = $optimized_idx_api->get_clients_featured(); // Cached results.
```

## February 2023 update

PropertyWebBuilder is now a standalone Ruby on Rails app (it is no longer a Ruby on Rails engine). It has also been upgraded to use Rails 6 and Ruby 3!

I am currently working on a Rails 7 upgrade which will use the wonderful vite-ruby gem to re-implement the admin panel with vue.js and the quasar framework:

https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/tree/vite

Also, I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting and would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

[https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)


## Motivation

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.


## Demo

<!-- You can try out a demo at [https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com](https://pwb-v2.herokuapp.com/)

To see the admin panel, login as user admin@example.com with a password of ""pwb123456"". -->

There was previously a demo hosted on heroku but since they ended the free plan I have had to take it down.

## Create your own real estate website with no technical knowledge

The simplest way to create a website with PropertyWebBuilder is to use Heroku, a trusted service provider.  They no longer have the free tier which was a great selling point but are still worth trying out.

Just [sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity), click the button below and in a few minutes your site will be ready

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder)

Here is a video about how to deploy to heroku:

[![Depoly PWB to heroku](http://img.youtube.com/vi/hyapXTwGyr4/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyapXTwGyr4 ""Deploy PWB to heroku"")


## Install locally

PWB was previously designed to be included as an engine in an existing Ruby on Rails app. This is no longer the case and you can now run it directly as a standalone app.

It can also be installed locally as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder.git
cd property_web_builder
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails pwb:db:seed
```

## Rails Version

PropertyWebBuilder runs with Rails '~> 6.0'

## Ruby Version

PropertyWebBuilder runs with Ruby >= 3.0.0.


## Features

* Multilingual
* Multi-currency
* Powerful search component
* Fully featured admin panel
* Google maps integration
* Customisable look and feel
* Easily extendable
* Search engine friendly
* Mobile friendly responsive layout
* Fully open source

## Coming soon

These are some features I plan to add over the coming months.  If there is something you need which is not on the list, please let me know.  I am also interested in knowing which of these features I should prioritize.

* Instant price conversions into other currencies
* Migrate admin section from an ember js app to vue js using the quasar framework
* [More languages](https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/issues/4)
* [More themes](https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/issues/3)

## What's this project is about

- [üî• Deployed Version üî•](https://desolate-refuge-17574.herokuapp.com/)

Real estate for sale & for rent website. Real estate website's visitors can easily filter their searches by type, location, price, and other predefined and custom criteria. Each property goes with a detailed description, community and property features, location, price, and a great image gallery.
Buyer of real estate can find contacts of seller. In case seller enabled online appointment feature for advertisement - buyer can fill in form to make online appointment request.

**Disclaimer:**
This project was merely a learning exercise as well as my first sizeable project delving into React, Redux & other used technologies.

**This repository contains a smart contract for a Digital Twin of a building, which fetches real-time data using Chainlink Oracles. This data includes temperature, humidity, occupancy, energy consumption, structural health, water consumption, and air quality. Additionally, the contract allows for the logging of maintenance reports.**

## Introduction

This Building Digital Twin Smart Contract creates a digital representation of a physical building. The digital twin concept is an important aspect of modern construction and building management as it allows for real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and simulations of different scenarios.

This smart contract utilizes Chainlink, a decentralized oracle network, to securely retrieve and write real-world data onto the blockchain. The parameters fetched include environmental aspects such as temperature and humidity, occupancy levels, energy and water consumption levels, and air quality data. It also considers the structural health of the building, providing a comprehensive digital overview of the physical building's state.

Moreover, the contract allows the owner to log maintenance reports, thereby enabling an integrated overview of not just the physical parameters but also the maintenance and repair history.

With the use of modifiers, this contract ensures that only the owner of the contract can update the parameters and add maintenance reports, providing a robust access control mechanism.

This contract is an example of the versatility and potential of Ethereum smart contracts, and how they can interface with real-world data via oracles.

## February 2023 update

PropertyWebBuilder is now a standalone Ruby on Rails app (it is no longer a Ruby on Rails engine). It has also been upgraded to use Rails 6 and Ruby 3!

I am currently working on a Rails 7 upgrade which will use the wonderful vite-ruby gem to re-implement the admin panel with vue.js and the quasar framework:

https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/tree/vite

Also, I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting and would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

[https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)


## Motivation

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.

## Create your own real estate website with no technical knowledge

The simplest way to create a website with PropertyWebBuilder is to use Heroku, a trusted service provider.  They no longer have the free tier which was a great selling point but are still worth trying out.

Just [sign up for Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/identity), click the button below and in a few minutes your site will be ready

## February 2023 update

PropertyWebBuilder is now a standalone Ruby on Rails app (it is no longer a Ruby on Rails engine). It has also been upgraded to use Rails 6 and Ruby 3!

I am currently working on a Rails 7 upgrade which will use the wonderful vite-ruby gem to re-implement the admin panel with vue.js and the quasar framework:

https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder/tree/vite

Also, I am currently working on a tool to help with house hunting and would love to get some feedback about it.

Please check it out here and let me know what you think (and if you would like it to be open-sourced):

[https://homestocompare.com/](https://homestocompare.com/)


## Motivation

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.


## Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etewiah/property_web_builder.git
cd property_web_builder
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails pwb:db:seed
```

## Getting started

Get started with the application by following the installation steps.

> Prerequisite
>
> - [Docker and docker-compose installed](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Clone the GitHub repository

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate.git
```

### 2. Build an Start the application

To effectively build and run the application, make use of the `mre` executable on Linux. If you are using Windows, utilize `mre.exe`, whereas on Mac, opt for `mre-macos`.

```shell
$ cd microrealestate
$ ./mre build
```

When building the first time, you can expect a series of questions to configure the application. Answer the questions as prompted to tailor the application to your specific needs. Once you've completed this interactive configuration, a `.env` file will be generated, containing your settings.

```
? Have you created a mailgun account for sending emails (https://www.mailgun.com/)? No

? Enter the URL to access the landlord front-end: http://localhost:8080/landlord

? Enter the URL to access the tenant front-end (it should share the same domain and port as the landlord front-end URL): http://localhost:8080/tenant
```

Once the build process has been completed, execute the following command to launch the application:

```shell
$ ./mre start
```

Once the application has started successfully, you will find a link displayed in the console to access the application.

Simply copy the link and paste into your preferred web browser to access the application's interface.

This repository is deprecated in favor of [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate).

The new version uses latest stack on the front-end (NextJS, ReactJS, MobX). The split between front and back-end code is more obvious and the UI has been fully rewritten.

Also, additional functionalities were added in order to customize the application to the landlords needs.

Developer wise [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate) should be easier to enhance and to maintain.

## Loca

### What is Loca?

This nodejs project is a tentative of web application that offers a toolkit for owners of buildings, flats, offices, meeting rooms, car parks, letter boxes...

The idea is to make easy the management of properties and occupants by proposing many services:

- Gather all information of your properties and occupants in one place
- Create rent contract from templates available in the system
- Follow the rent payments month by month
- Template letters for recovery of not paid rents

![Loca](http://www.nuageprive.fr/images/loca-sample.png 'Open source real estate management')

### Getting started

Follow instructions from [here](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate#getting-started)

### Technical Stack

Back-end:

Node, Express, MongoDB, EJS (templates), PassportJS (authentication)

Front-End:

JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, and [frontexpress](https://github.com/camelaissani/frontexpress)

Build system based on RollupJS

### Why do I created this application?

Simply to help my best friend and I to manage properties that we rent.

Above all, to have a good reason to play with node and javascript :-)

Online rental property manager (ORPM) is a free open source app.
It allows you to manage landlords, rental properties, units, 
applications, leases and tenants. Add all details related to the tenants, i.e. references, 
rental history, employment history and income overview.

ORPM was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/).
So you can easily customize it to add/remove 
details or any extra functionality to fit your own requirements. 
ORPM is a responsive, multi-user web-based application that you can access from your PC, tablet, 
mobile or any other device.

This repository is deprecated in favor of [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate).

The new version uses latest stack on the front-end (NextJS, ReactJS, MobX). The split between front and back-end code is more obvious and the UI has been fully rewritten.

Also, additional functionalities were added in order to customize the application to the landlords needs.

Developer wise [MicroRealEstate](https://github.com/microrealestate/microrealestate) should be easier to enhance and to maintain.

## Loca

Online rental property manager (ORPM) is a free open source app.
It allows you to manage landlords, rental properties, units, 
applications, leases and tenants. Add all details related to the tenants, i.e. references, 
rental history, employment history and income overview.

ORPM was created using [AppGini](https://bigprof.com/appgini/).
So you can easily customize it to add/remove 
details or any extra functionality to fit your own requirements. 
ORPM is a responsive, multi-user web-based application that you can access from your PC, tablet, 
mobile or any other device.

Movin' In is a Rental Property Management Platform with a backend for managing properties, customers and bookings, a frontend and a mobile app for renting properties.

Movin' In is designed to work with multiple agencies. Agencies can manage their properties and bookings from the backend. Movin' In can also work with only one agency as well.

From the backend, administrators can create and manage agencies, properties, locations, users and bookings.

When new agencies are created, they receive an email prompting them to create their account to access the backend and manage their properties, customers and bookings.

Customers can sign up from the frontend or the mobile app, search for available properties based on location point and time, choose a property and complete the checkout process.

A key design decision was made to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript due to its numerous advantages. TypeScript offers strong typing, tooling, and integration, resulting in high-quality, scalable, more readable and maintainable code that is easy to debug and test.

<img src=""https://movin-in.github.io/content/docker.png"" alt="""" width=""220"" />

Movin' In can run in a Docker container. Follow this step by step [guide](https://github.com/aelassas/movinin/wiki/Docker) to walk you through on how to build Movin' In Docker image and run it in a Docker container.

Leveraging Meraki's guest WiFi captive Wi-Fi portal to improve customer engagement and provide instant contextual feedback to property mgmt duty manager. To improve guest feedback which is often shared in social media after the guest has left the premise with vivid negative experience, telling the world via social media their negative experiecnce with damaged reputation difficult to remediate.  This simple guest survey (splash page) is to collect user feedback upon successful guest Wi-Fi login. We leverage the built-in feature of Meraki Access Point. https://documentation.meraki.com/MR/MR_Splash_Page/Splash_Page_Details_for_Meraki_MR

A google form is created to collect feedback with rating between 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good)

If the feedback score is 1, the google script on the google form will triger an email (via Google SMTP) to duty manager's email address.

A language match of the feedback's text will be used to select the appropriate MV to take a snapshot whereby the image will be included in the email to be sent to the duty manager to give more context. For example, if the feedback says ""broken glass near the exit A"", then script will send API call to Meraki MV camera near exit A to take a screenshot and the image is pasted onto the email to Duty Manager to give a visual on the area for impact to customer flow near Exist A.

## What's this project is about

- [üî• Deployed Version üî•](https://desolate-refuge-17574.herokuapp.com/)

Real estate for sale & for rent website. Real estate website's visitors can easily filter their searches by type, location, price, and other predefined and custom criteria. Each property goes with a detailed description, community and property features, location, price, and a great image gallery.
Buyer of real estate can find contacts of seller. In case seller enabled online appointment feature for advertisement - buyer can fill in form to make online appointment request.

**Disclaimer:**
This project was merely a learning exercise as well as my first sizeable project delving into React, Redux & other used technologies.
